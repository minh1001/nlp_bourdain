       "['\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:00:16] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through translator) The Ground Rules of Kolsch.  It is what it is.  It\\'ll come as it comes.  It\\'s always gone well.  What\\'s gone is gone.  Nothing stays as it was.  Don\\'t know it, don\\'t need it, chuck it.  What\\'re you going to do?  Do it right, but not too often.  What\\'s with that?  You drinking\\' one with us?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  They say, and by \"they,\" I mean people from around here, that Cologne is an ugly city.  This is quickly followed by the proud statement that the people are nice.  That they are welcoming, tolerant, kind, open to new things.  I never saw Cologne as ugly at all.  I always saw it as, well, charming in the least patronizing sense of the word.  I mean, this city charms you. It takes you in.  It makes you feel welcome.\\n\\nMaybe it was the non-douchey beer culture here that appealed.  I don\\'t mean beer culture in a judgmental neck beard hovering over you waiting for you to decide between craft beers way either.  I mean, but here decent beer is a way of life.  It\\'s a birthright.  You don\\'t talk about it too much.  You freakin\\' drink it.  Beer here means more often than not, Kolsch.  Heinz Grune has lived in Cologne his whole life.\\n\\nHEINZ GRUNE, COLOGNE RESIDENT:  Cheers.  Prost.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Prost.  He does marketing for several German breweries, so Kolsch is an integral part of both his social and business lives. Kolsch is not a brand.  What is this anyway?\\n\\nGRUNE:  Let\\'s call it a style.  It\\'s a pale ale and people loves to drink it in high amounts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Malzmuhle Brewery has been slinging beer non-stop for the last 150 years.  Democratic, utilitarian, welcoming to all people with a powerful thirst.  I love the whole style, the little glasses.  Is this unique to Cologne?\\n\\nGRUNE:  Other regions of Germany, you won\\'t find such small glass.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGRUNE:  They start with \\'03 to \\'05. BOURDAIN:  To the giant.\\n\\nGRUNE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, if you have a giant thing of beer, it\\'s like piss warm by the time you get down to the bottom.\\n\\nGRUNE:  Right.  But here it\\'s necessary because it is not very carbonated and the foam disappears in minutes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nGRUNE:  There are guys who drink it in one sip.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not sure the exact blood absorption rate of alcohol but I would think that if you\\'re hammering these things back, it\\'s hitting your bloodstream at the perfect rate.\\n\\nGRUNE:  Maybe we he to name them alcoholic but they are accustomed to it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are certain iconic accompaniments to beer drinking when in Cologne.  Like Mettbroetchen which is minced raw pork with onions on a roll.  Or Halve Hahn, which is simply gouda cheese on rye. This is really good.\\n\\nGRUNE:  By now you see how it goes, no?  You\\'ll get the Kolsch without ordering.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t like this custom, though.  I don\\'t want to know how many beers I\\'ve had.  This is ...\\n\\nGRUNE:  OK, but he has to know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, that\\'s fine.  Can\\'t he do his own little system somewhere around here?  I\\'m thinking, \"Geez, I\\'ve got a problem.\" It\\'s when the Himmel und Erde or Heaven and Earth hits the table that I start getting deep into my happy zone.  That\\'s blood sausage, fried onions, and mashed potatoes with applesauce which if you don\\'t like, by the way, pretty much removes you from my \"will save from drowning\" list.  And then, there\\'s this.  The dish that almost alone brought me back to Cologne.  It was sweet, sweet memories of this stegosaurus sized shank of cured pork boiled and boiled until it literally falls away from the bone steaming and moist, a symphony of meat and gelatin and good, good stuff.  God is hiding in there somewhere.\\n\\n[21:05:10] GRUNE:  Cologne is a workers\\' town, you know?  So the kitchen is definitely a workers\\' kitchen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And yet, it has a pretty liberal progressive world view. Where did that come from?\\n\\nGRUNE:  It has something to do with the river.  Occupation here was trading, so the Cologne people from the beginning were interested in other people and they took profit of other people.  We are not afraid of influences from outside.  But therefore, it\\'s also important to have some traditions that are lasting for a long time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And one of those would be Kolsch.\\n\\nGRUNE:  One of is Kolsch, one of it\\'s a dish and people know that they can come here, and it won\\'t change.  This place will not change in the next 200 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cologne is or was a predominately Catholic city, perhaps more Mediterranean in temperament than those fun-hating Lutherans and Calvinists.  It\\'s Germany\\'s fun-zone and from November to February Cologners celebrates Carnival.  Partying here has a whole season.\\n\\nCarnival here is an exuberant, anarchistic, bat-shit wild, 40-day celebration leading up to Lent.  It can be absolute mayhem.  My completely rational fear of clowns, mimes, parades, public dancing and crowds in general really, prohibits me from taking part.\\n\\nThese days Brian Jones could come back from the grave for one night only with the Stones and Janis and Jimmy and Jim, they could all be there.  And you know what?  I ain\\'t going.  But the Cologners, God bless them.  They love it.\\n\\nBei Oma Kleinmann handles enormous crowds of revelers.  Fortunately, the madness is still a few weeks away.  And this is my old friend Tracey (ph) who had the good or bad fortune, depending on how you look at it, to travel and produce shows around the world with me for many years.  Anke (ph) is from Cologne and makes me feel better about my Carnival phobia.  Carnival, do you like Carnival?\\n\\nTRACEY, ANTHONY BOURDAIN\\'S FRIEND:  I do, and I\\'m not ashamed to say it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Will jesters and bards and medievally attired pranksters be popping up during my stay here?\\n\\nTRACEY:  You\\'re missing out.  You\\'re really are ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mimes?  No mimes, troubadours, jugglers, uh, human statues?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Come on.\\n\\nANKE, COLOGNE RESIDENT:  All of them are wearing bonkers costumes and look like shit.  I don\\'t like it.  No, I always get embarrassed about those people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate Carnival.\\n\\nANKE:  I hate Carnival too.\\n\\nTRACEY:  You ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there parades?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Yes.\\n\\nANKE:  Yes. BOURDAIN:  I hate parades.\\n\\nTRACEY:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there clowns?\\n\\nTRACEY:  You hate clowns.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate clowns.\\n\\nTRACEY:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jesters?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Yeah, occasionally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Festive attire?  I have beer right now.  I don\\'t need no stinking Carnival to drink beer, man.  And as I understand it, I am urged to drink beer as part of a community of beer drinkers with other bros.  I hate bros.\\n\\nTRACEY:  It\\'s not just bros.  It\\'s a whole community of people speaking in dialect, singing songs in dialect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Singing, I forgot to mention that.\\n\\nTRACEY:  Singing is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate that too.\\n\\nTRACEY:  There is another side and if you open your heart you would see it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My heart is a cold, cold place, and there\\'s no room in it for jugglers.  What did you think when you heard that I want to come to Germany and go to Cologne?\\n\\nTRACEY:  That\\'s awesome because Cologne is like the other city in Germany that I can really identify with.  It\\'s like I have this love affair with it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I often say that the places I go, there\\'s a pheromonic (ph) decision made very quickly.  You step outside the airport terminal, and then you go, may you know right away.  There\\'s something about this place that\\'s -- that I think I\\'m going to like.\"\\n\\nANKE:  A few weeks ago a friend of mine from Berlin came to visit me, and after three days he just looked at me and said, \"Anke, what is this?  Why are you all so satisfied?  Why are you all so happy?  Why are you all so relaxed?\"  I don\\'t know, maybe it is because everybody\\'s telling us that our city is ugly and Berlin is the big thing.  Maybe we have to show with our hearts that we are good people and we -- that we are having fun and I think the Kolsch is helping.\\n\\n[21:10:09] TRACEY:  For some reason every time I arrive here, I always feel like somehow the people are more open here to me being American and speaking German.  And part of it is this Carnival thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Maybe it\\'s my own self-discovery of like being in another place and finally being accepted, maybe because I\\'m in costume and they don\\'t know right away that I\\'m not German.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, it\\'s sort of like an \"Eyes Wide Shut\" kind of a thing.\\n\\nTRACEY:  I know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is what I came here for, though.  Surfboard-sized slabs of veal and pork filled with many wonderful things, dredged in bread crumbs and fried in magical, magical deep fat.  Now that\\'s a Carnival I can get behind.  Wow.\\n\\nTRACEY:  That looks amazing.\\n\\nANKE:  Wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is unbelievable.\\n\\nTRACEY:  Supposedly, you can split your schnitzel in half, take the other half home and it\\'s really good for breakfast.\\n\\nANKE:  Yeah.\\n\\nTRACEY:  It\\'s like the German equivalent of pizza in the morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Well, there\\'s a tradition I totally support. Considering it\\'s a weird drinking culture, at the end of the night, will there be two or three or five or ten people all hang out like way past the point that they should have gone home?  Or does everybody reach a sensible point of intoxication or say, \"Well you know what? I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\"?  I mean, they\\'re forcing beers on us.  I didn\\'t order a beer and another one just keeps coming.\\n\\nTRACEY:  Do you know how to make it stop?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Face plant it to my schnitzel?\\n\\nTRACEY:  There\\'s an easier way.  You do this.  That means, like, \"I\\'m done.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, but nobody\\'s doing that.\\n\\nANKE:  Not yet.\\n\\nTRACEY:  I\\'m not doing that.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:15:24] BOURDAIN:  So, let\\'s talk about the elephant in the room. We know that Cologne is a proudly tolerant, fun-loving, beer drinking, pork-happy and friendly little city.  But just a few days before we arrived, Cologne became the focus of the whole argument over Europe\\'s refugee crisis.\\n\\nCologne of all places is now the example for both sides of an increasingly bitter argument over whether Europe and by the extension the world should turn their backs on the millions of refugees spilling out of Syria, Iraq, and a Middle East spinning into chaos and slaughter.  With the bodies of children washing up on Greek beaches and few other countries willing to help, Germany has taken in 1.1 million people fleeing ISIS, Russian and Syrian bombs and war.  One should, I believe, be admired and even celebrated for doing the morally right thing over the probably wise thing.\\n\\nSakher Al Mohamad is one of many who found his way to Cologne.  Hani Zaitoun helps refugees as they try to integrate into German society. This is unsurprisingly easier said than done.  Getting to Turkey, no problem?\\n\\nSAKHER AL MOHAMAD, REFUGEE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Turkey to Greece, problems.\\n\\nHANI ZAITOUN:  Getting to Turkey is now a problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  But in that time, it was not a problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Next, went from Greece to Macedonia?  Yes, correct? Welcome there?\\n\\nAL MOHAMAD:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Serbia?\\n\\nAL MOHAMAD:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Were you welcomed here?\\n\\nAL MOHAMAD:  Yes.  Very welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So here we are, Cologne, one of the most liberal, if not the most liberal cities in Germany.  A city doing the right thing. And on New Year\\'s Eve, the whole attitude towards refugees, not just European policy, but the whole moral question was thrown into doubt.\\n\\nCologne found itself the test case, both the example of tolerance and hope and worst-case scenario.  Here\\'s what was reported.  On the night of December 31, 2015, witnesses saw crowds of up to a thousand men described as predominately Arab and North African near Cologne Central Train Station.  Some broke off into small groups, assaulting hundreds of women as they left the train station.  Police were completely unprepared.  The situation continued reportedly for hours.\\n\\nThree weeks after the incident, the official numbers were as horrifying as first reported.  766 criminal complaints, of which 381 are sexual offenses, including 3 rapes.  Many across the world of course saw this as the perfect \"I told you so\" moment.  A sadly understandable reaction.  There is no minimizing 381 sexual offenses in one night.\\n\\nHow big an effect is this going to have on the situation?\\n\\nZAITOUN:  So all Syrians that I knew were totally condemning what happened and we absolutely cannot tolerate something like this because it\\'s not a part of my culture, it\\'s not a part of ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But do you think it will change the political climate is what I\\'m asking.  Before it was relatively easy for a German politician to say, \"Look, have a heart here.  Let\\'s do the right and moral thing.\" And it is being used as a club to beat any politician or leader who would like to have a more conciliatory or more welcoming attitude towards people who clearly need help.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  Refugees are human beings.  And some of them are good and some of them are bad.  There is 500 refugees who did this and they\\'re pretty bad.  It\\'s the fault of those who did it but it\\'s not the fault of the refugees.  It\\'s not the fault of the Germans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The infrastructure exists more or less to ...\\n\\nZAITOUN:  Exists.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... handle this enormous influx.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  An integration of 200,000 to 300,000 would be easier than integration of 1.1 million that entered in 2015.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  This is a challenge not only for the Germans but also for those who came to integrate in the community.  It\\'s something that has to be worked -- work on from both sides, not only the Syrians, but also the Germans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  The Germans are willing to because that they\\'re pretty well organized.\\n\\n[21:20:17] BOURDAIN:  Germany and Cologne had reason to believe they could pull this off.  Absorb all those refugees from a culture very different than their own.  Here in Cologne, the Turkish presence is larger than any other in the country.  F\\n\\nAs I understand that during the \\'60s, \\'70s, the German industry essentially recruited in cooperation with the Turkish government, huge numbers of Turkish workers.  Was that the beginning of the size able Turkish population?\\n\\nMELEK YAPRAK, TURKISH IMMIGRANT:  Yes.  It was.  Like my grandfather and my grandmother, they came here in the \\'70s.  My parents, they started to work in a company like in the, a rural company.  Everybody has almost the same story in this good generation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Melek Yaprak\\'s (ph) grandparents were among the first wave of Turks to arrive in Cologne.  And to a great extent nowadays, Turkish food is German food, the way Italian, Eastern European, Jewish, and Chinese have become American food.  Raki to start.  Prost.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Prost.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That brings me back.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah?  This brings back Istanbul to us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  When we go there, we have always Raki and the Bosphorus and here, this is like Istanbul feeling for us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, me too.  And meze.  Spicy mashed vegetables, tzatziki, hummus, beetroot and olive dip, fried eggplant, pastries with feta, meatballs with tomato sauce and mint.  Wow.  That looks really pretty.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I don\\'t think that you have any problems with spice?  Yeah?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, no, no.  I don\\'t.  Very much.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Not at all.  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since you are born here, how Turkish do you feel?  And how German do you feel?  And when does that equation change?  Are there times when you feel like, \"I\\'m not part of this,\" or other times you feel, \"Oh, I am definitely part of this.\"\\n\\nYAPRAK:  That\\'s a question -- I\\'m thinking about all my life.  In my heart, I\\'m Turkish.  In my head, I\\'m German.  I\\'m glad that my parents wanted to have a good education for me.  But still at home, they were Turkish, like Turkish traditions and for the Turkish thinking, so I was always on both sides.  And now, I\\'m adult enough to pick the best ones from both sides.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Growing up here as the child of Turkish immigrants, how did you feel in school?  You felt German?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah.  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, why do you think Germany\\'s good at that?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  The Germans are very correct people.  They want to have everything on the point.  They don\\'t like surprises.  So they organize everything before.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s almost a cliche that it\\'s organized.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  It\\'s not a cliche, it\\'s organized.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Grilled minced lamb basted with hot tomato sauce and slathered with melted sheep butter and yogurt.  Roast lamb with feta, bulgur, and roasted vegetables.  That\\'s beautiful.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Danke schon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if you graduate from University here and choose to live in Cologne, could you afford to live here?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah.  You can.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s reasonably affordable.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah.  But because of the refugee situation I think living space is becoming less, like everywhere.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think this is a pretty town?  Every -- most of the people I speak to say, \"Well, you know, we\\'re a very ugly city.\"\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I don\\'t think so.  I think it\\'s very pretty.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Everything was destroyed after the Second World War.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, but it\\'s not the most beautiful city in the world but it is not an ugly city, I mean, at all.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I think I\\'m more with the ugly city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think it\\'s ugly?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  The buildings are new, ugly, gray, like made up after the Second World War.  There\\'s only small, old town.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I miss the old buildings like in Munich.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So 20 years from now, will Cologne be the same?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t want to think about it because now it\\'s fine.  I love it as it is now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t hear that a lot.  You know, you go to San Francisco, Rio, there are pressing problems or that the character of the city is changing.  The character of this city does not seem to be changing.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  No.  It stays as it is.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:28:00] BOURDAIN:  If there\\'s one musical movement or one band that represents Cologne better than this one, I don\\'t know what it could be.  Created in 1964, with Holger Czukay, Jaki Liebzeit, Michael Karoli, and this man, Irmin Schmidt, Can was at the forefront of what was called inevitably the Krautrock Movement.  Combing the sounds and attitudes of classical, avant-garde, rock and funk.\\n\\nSo, so you moved here -- how old were you when you ... IRMIN, KARL HEINZ STOCKHAUSEN\\'S COLLEAGUE:  I\\'m here in \\'64.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Interesting time, \\'64.\\n\\nIRMIN:  It was a very interesting time.  It was the time of -- where Cologne was really blossoming.  It was the art town in Germany.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Irmin (ph) studied with Karl Heinz Stockhausen (ph), but it was a trip to New York City where he was exposed to what new read and similarly classically trained John Cale were doing with the Velvet Underground that would prove to be the catalyst for Can.\\n\\n\\'64 was still pretty early days for cultural ferment, I guess maybe.\\n\\nIRMIN:  But not here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not here.\\n\\nIRMIN:  Not here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, so the question is, why here?  What was it about Cologne?\\n\\nIRMIN:  Well, I think it\\'s this generation which were like me.  We grew up in this after war, terrible destruction.  And that was the generation which started to create something new.  That was bubbling from everywhere.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n[21:00:17] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\":  Some places surprise you.  Even if you\\'ve been traveling nearly non-stop for 15 years like me, there are places that snap you out of your comfortable world view, take your assumptions and your prejudices, and turn them upside down.  They lead you to believe that maybe there is hope in the world.  Senegal is one of those places.\\n\\n(SHA-LA-LA-ING PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At first you see what you see in so many places in Africa -- the noisy streets, busy markets, the controlled, consensual chaos of daily commerce.  But look just a little bit longer, a little bit deeper, and you\\'ll see it\\'s so different here from its neighbors -- from anywhere, really.  A rebuke to those who\\'d paint a whole continent as a monolith of despair, or Islam as something to be feared.  Senegal turns simple minded assumptions and prejudice on their heads at every turn.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did you come to know and like and love this country?\\n\\nOFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, NPR AFRICA CORRESPONDENT:  I think it was just listening and watching and thinking, \"Gosh, this is quite different to all the other countries I know.\"  For a start, the languages.  You\\'ve heard Wolof?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  (SPEAKS WOLOF) Sometimes you think people were quarrelling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  And they\\'re not, they\\'re laughing.  They\\'re laughing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is the NPR Africa correspondent. She\\'s of Ghanaian descent, but has made Dakar the Senegalese capital, her home for over ten years.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON: The Senegalese are easy to get on with and they care about you and I guess that\\'s what we all want as human beings, isn\\'t it?  To be loved, to be cherished.  And, I found that here.  I won\\'t be here forever because I\\'m from Ghana, but I will be visiting forever because there are no two Senegals.  I mean (SPEAKING FRENCH).  I think the Senegalese are extraordinary, they\\'re open, they welcome you, and, for me, that about makes a good place to live.  BOURDAIN:  I fear I come with this assumption that Senegal will be yet\\n\\nanother failed state or yet another state that, that has gone through, uh, a really terrible post-colonial period that never really --that, that transitioned badly.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  You\\'ll know that Senegal is one of the few countries, never had a coup d\\'etat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  And I think that that just makes such a huge difference to a nation.  We\\'re in a ninety-plus percent Muslim country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  Their first president, a Catholic who governed for 20 years.  And, of course, there, there were elements of repression but not as we\\'ve seen in many other African countries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Europeans first reached West Africa in the mid-15th Century bringing with them the usual things -- an  industrialized slave trade, subjugation, the rule of the many by the very few.  In the carving up of a continent it was France that got Senegal and commanding favorite status within France\\'s West African Colonial holdings, the Senegalese gained full rights as French citizens in the late 1800\\'s.  With independence in 1960, power passed bloodlessly and with stunning cordiality.  Though overwhelmingly a Muslim country, Senegal elected Leopold Senghor, a Catholic as their first president and, from that time on, Senegal has enjoyed a moderate political and religious climate unique almost anywhere in the world.\\n\\n[21:05:20] PIERRE THIAM, PIERRE THIAM CATERING OWNER:  Well, food is great when cultures meet, you know?  Because the colonial power brought their food culture.  I think that\\'s what makes great food and, uh, Senegal is great for that because of its geographical location. It\\'s a cross road.  I think that\\'s what makes the food quite unique here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pierre Thiam is a chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author who was born and raised here in Dakar.  His books are absolutely fundamental references when investigating Senegalese cuisine.\\n\\nTHIAM:  This is Senegalese favorite fish.  It is called Thiof.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It kind of tastes like grouper.  So, I think we should have it.  Great fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nSenegal has famously delicious food -- flavors, and, often, ingredients that should be eerily familiar to any fan of Southern cooking.  We meet at Cour De Cassation Beach serving food just the way I like it -- a shack on the water, catch of the day, cooked up out back.  THIAM:  This whole thing is illegal, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s, it\\'s -- they don\\'t have a license.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But, I mean, they\\'re continuously operating.  I mean it technically --\\n\\nTHIAM:  But, every once in a while -- once in a while, I come and it\\'s closed.  The police shuts them down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  But then they come back.\\n\\nTHIAM:  And then they come back.  You know?  It\\'s --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh!  These are supposed to be good, right?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is local beer.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s the local beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s the finest of the local beer.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Well, it\\'s considered the people\\'s beer.  It\\'s the cheapest one.  Yes, so --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, well, huh, it figures.  I\\'m a cheap date.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDo you want to hide these, uh?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Actually the, yes.  Just put it under the table, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know what I\\'m going to do?  Yes.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Cheers, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Welcome to Dakar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  So, I\\'m really interested in your story.  I mean, you were born here.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes, right here in Dakar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right here in Dakar.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yep.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Went to New York.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, I\\'m jumping ahead some but --\\n\\nTHIAM:  First job in New York was, uh, a restaurant job like --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of course.\\n\\nTHIAM:  -- every, every immigrant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  You know?  As a busboy, actually, but from a busboy, I just fell in love with what was happening behind the kitchen because, you know, I come from a culture where kitchen is a women activity and also, it\\'s like, I\\'d never seen men cooking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What, what was the type of cuisine you were learning?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Mostly American, continental American, and then it turned to Jean Claude, was French Bistro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  And from Jean Claude, boom opened around the corner.  It was, like, early \\'90s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wait a minute.  Boom on Spring Street?\\n\\nTHIAM:  On Spring Street!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay, wait a minute.  I used to work at that store, at, before it was called WPA.  So --\\n\\nTHIAM:  Wow!\\n\\nBOURDAIN: -- we worked in the same restaurant kitchen.\\n\\nTHIAM:  In the same kitchen.  It\\'s like --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Downstairs kitchen.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Basement kitchen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was downstairs.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Oh, I can\\'t believe this, man.  Well, Boom, Boom was really the defining moment for me.  Boom had, like, this global ethnic/Italian --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you saw a window to start introducing African, West African flavors?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And it, it worked.  People were receptive to that.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Absolutely, yes, yes.  Oh, wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight we\\'re having yassa made with the local fish called thiof.  Cooked simply, on the bone, wrapped in foil, and steamed over the fire, served with a mignonette-type sauce of onions.\\n\\nOh, yes.\\n\\nGrilled mussels.  Sea urchin.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm, grilled mussels is cool.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that was good.  Mm, starving.  I mean, I\\'m really hungry.  So, what distinguishes Senegalese cuisine from the neighbors?\\n\\nTHIAM:  I think we have the best food in the continent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you, you\\'ve traveled in the American south?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Um, I mean, do you notice some things about the food?\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s familiar.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIt\\'s so familiar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s, I mean, look, like, shrimp and grits.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay?  I mean, I\\'ve eaten shrimp and grits in Africa many times.  I mean, they call it something else.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Exactly.  I think the most interesting part of American food is our, our contribution.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did you feel when you first turned on TV and you see some, you know, rich white lady and she says, \"Well, we\\'re about to do,\" you know, \"my family, this is an old family recipe.\"  You know?\" An American classic, a traditional favorite.\"  Do you say, \"Wait a minute that\\'s -- \"\\n\\nTHIAM:  \"That\\'s mine!\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  \"That\\'s mine.\"  I mean, happy?  Proud?  Pissed off?  What?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Oh yes.  Proud, proud.  Happy too.  No, not pissed off.  No, that, I was never pissed off.  I thought, you know, yes.  I think food is such a great way of uniting people.  You know?  It\\'s like you\\'re breaking barriers.  Food is not only about feeding yourself here in Senegal, it\\'s a whole culture.  The most important value is what we call \"Teranga.\"  The more you share, the more your bowl will be plentiful.  It\\'s not how much you have, it\\'s how much you give. That\\'s what matters in Senegal.  So, so Teranga is that culture.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:13:33] BOURDAIN:  The call to prayer.  Five times a day, every day.  But Friday at 2 P.M. is the most important.  Dakar shuts down as people head to the mosque -- the invocation of the Muslim reverberates throughout the city.  The mosques fill to capacity, people spill onto the sidewalks and streets, they pray where they can.  In Senegal the majority of the people are Sufi Muslims, practicing a mystic form of Islam which is often considered more tolerant.\\n\\nFAMA DIOUF, CEO & ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT F. DIOUF PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO: Senegal is very different from other countries.  We all very tolerance.  We also have, in Senegalese family, Christian married to Muslim, Muslim married to Christian.  So, you don\\'t really know exactly who\\'s Christian and you don\\'t really know who is Muslim.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is a comfortable assumption that Islam is oppressive to women -- that it allows no room for personal expression, that it forces women to hide themselves.  These ladies, however make that argument more complicated.  Fama Diouf is a photographer.  Oumy Ndour is a journalist and television presenter.  Minielle Tall is an entrepreneur and owner of a group of salons.  As the country changes many, if not most, have adopted the cultural values and styles of the west.  However, two of these women have chosen to wear the traditional hijab.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of people who watch this, particularly women, look at the hijab in particular as an instrument, at the very least as an instrument of male oppression.  What would you say to them?\\n\\nOUMY NDOUR, JOURNALIST:  For me religion is a, uh, is a personal thing and I, and I decide, decided to, to get this.  So, why people keep on asking me every day, \"Why?  Why?  Why?\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I, I think the, the simple answer is that what to you is a personal lifestyle choice looks, too much of the world like a political choice.\\n\\nNDOUR:  It is a choice for me.  So, some of the Senegalese girls, they have a choice to wear Western clothes.  I have also as a right to wear (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nMINIELLE TALL, ENTREPRENEUR:  In a way the reason behind it for every Muslim, uh, will be modesty.  Whether you come from a rich background or a poor background, people should not judge you on the way you dress.  She doesn\\'t want you to be, like, \"Oh my gosh.  I love her hair.  Oh, her earrings!  Oh!  The watch!  No, you see us as something threatening but we are just here in peace.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about women\\'s roles here, traditionally?  In many of the African countries that I\\'ve been to often you will see the man walking up front and behind the wife and the children, you know, carry, carrying the, the bucket of water or, you know, laden down doing the work.\\n\\nDIOUF:  I mean, here, in Dakar, you\\'re not going to see it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You say that with a -- with determination.\\n\\nDIOUF:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I am definitely sure about that, OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As if you will personally ensure that you won\\'t.\\n\\nDIOUF:  Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSeriously, I think it\\'s time for women to change the face of Senegal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not now?\\n\\nDIOUF:  They are not ready for that right now.\\n\\nTALL:  Well --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not?  What\\'s missing?\\n\\nTALL:  You will have powerful women, like, arguing for what we call \"parite\" here.  So, gender balance.  And, then, you take that same woman and you tell her that her son is supposed to start cooking and doing the laundry.  Laundry -- there is even a word.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m sorry, what\\'s wrong with that?\\n\\nTALL:  So, for Senegalese women, taking care of her man and treating him as a king is part of who she is and she is taking proud of it.\\n\\nNDOUR:  It\\'s too easy to be a, a boy here in Senegal.  You do nothing, nothing.\\n\\nDIOUF:  There\\'s been men in the position of presidential but we can have, uh, also a woman in the head of, uh, Senegal.  If we don\\'t try, we will never know.\\n\\n[21:18:29] BOURDAIN:  Sometimes we get lucky.  We get to do things on this show because -- just because it\\'s a show, that are, frankly, awesome.  Like this, a small restaurant in Dakar.  The delicious smells of Senegalese cooking coming from the kitchen.  A band.\\n\\n(YOUSSOU N\\'DOUR PERFORMING)\\n\\nYoussou N\\'Dour -- one of the most beloved musicians on the African continent.  Famous throughout the world for blending of traditional music of the region with Cuban rumba, American jazz, and R&B.  Mbalax, as it came to be known, has had an enormous influence on musicians worldwide -- like that sting guy.  Tracy Chapman, and Saint Bruce of Asbury, and, most famously, his frequent collaborator Peter Gabriel.\\n\\n(YOUSSOU N\\'DOUR PERFORMING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  People started to talk about you when you age 12 when you started to perform, uh, professionally.\\n\\nYOUSSOU N\\'DOUR, SENEGALESE SINGER:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But did you come from a musical tradition?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  My mom, she\\'s a griot.  Griot are the storytellers and they are also singers, rappers, and everything.  And I, I grow with my grandma, she was a big singer.  She gave me a lot of things.  And from there going to the school for two years, then left the school and start my career.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight we are having a beef mafe, which is a stew thickened with ground peanuts.  There are similar preparations throughout West Africa, but the Senegalese version is particularly great.  Sear the beef, cook the onion, garlic, peppers, and carrots, deglaze with ground peanuts and broth, bringing up all that good stuff from the pan, then simmer until tender and awesome.  Serve hot over rice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  Ah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks good.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  That\\'s good.  Good, good, good, good, good.  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  This is very, very good.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  The symbol of connection, Mali and Senegal, is the mafe. This dish, you can appreciate here, you can appreciate in Mali also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what\\'s the future?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  Future?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The future.  Twenty years from now, where will Senegal be?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  What I hope is in 20 years, Senegal is going to be the place for great and big contribution of what we call Islam.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think there\\'s any danger of, the kind of radical Islam that we see taking hold in many places in Africa?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  All these people who are using the religion, Muslim religion, to do bad things, I think Senegal have example.  I this country have models of the religion.  This country, you know, you are here, I\\'m doing my local bissap and you are with your beer and country 95 percent Muslim.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  And, I think this example can help all the world.  BOURDAIN:  I hope so.  Inshallah.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  Inshallah.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n[21:23:23] N\\'DOUR:  Merci, thank you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:27:14] BOURDAIN:  Time stopped.  That\\'s what it seems like in the City of Saint-Louis when the sun is at its highest and the streets are empty.  A hundred sixty miles up the coast from Dakar, the one-time capital was a hub for all French West Africa -- an important port at the mouth of the Senegal River.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every culture has an iconic, much loved, street food -- the kind of thing you yearn for when you\\'re away.  We have our dirty water hot dogs in New York, here they have Ndamb (ph).\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What people have described as a bean sandwich, but what is really a spread of spicy lentils on a baguette.  You buy your baguette at the bakery, bring it over to the nice lady, she slathers on the good stuff, and there you go.  And it is, indeed, addictively delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, everything comes, came through here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that we can understand, the case of Saint Louis, the situation of Saint Louis, we can understand it if only if we know well the geography.  Because what made this town according to me is the river.  Because it runs through five states, five countries.  Mali, Mauritania, Senegal of course, Guinea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, everything comes --\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nAttitude about many things are decidedly different here.  Where many post-colonial cultures around (INAUDIBLE) conflicting about their bloodlines -- picking black or white to identity with -- here, people are proud of who they are and where they came from.  All of it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m curious why the post-colonial experience in Senegal is so different than the post-colonial experience almost everywhere else.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that the pre-colonial and the colonial in Senegal is different, also.  Not only the post-colonial experience, because in Saint-Louis we had lots of influences, I think.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Arab, Portuguese, uh --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, because, yes, the Portuguese and the English first they were here and after that, the Moroccan from Morocco.\\n\\nMARIE-CAROLINE CAMARA, ST. LOUIS METISSE:  My feeling was this -- that because we are at the crossing of various roads, eh, independently from the colonization prior, makes the Senegalese people very open- minded, very good negotiators, also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Marie-Caroline Camara is a St. Louis metisse -- Senegalese father, French mother -- and she\\'s hosted a lunch with some friends and colleagues, all of whom consider themselves Senegalese first, before anything.\\n\\nCAMARA:  And, and my feeling compared to other African countries, is that maybe it\\'s come also from, uh, the, the Wolof women because the metis family here, people were really married.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, at least the descendants --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Between Wolof and other groups.\\n\\nCAMARA:  -- recognize, you know?  Compared to West Indies where even if people had, um, some white people had children with, um, their slaves they were not recognized.  Here all these, uh, children and unions were recognized.  So, for me that is very special.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The most, eh, um, riches in, in Senegal is our culture.  Is not, uh, petrol, oil, or, other thing.  I think that it\\'s our culture, our -- our type of life, our customs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Music.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Music, yes.  Our, uh, culinary art.\\n\\nCAMARA:  OK, so, we are eating Mulet Farci a la Saint-Louisienne.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lovely.\\n\\nCAMARA:  It\\'s a big fish from the river.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mulet Farci -- stuffed mullet.  The fish deboned and filled with a seafood farce of fish, herbs, vegetables, and bread and baked.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s an amazing meal.  Delicious.\\n\\nCAMARA:  Amazing meal?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, really good.\\n\\nCAMARA:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, how are things in Senegal today?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How are things?  What kind of things?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is the environment good for business in Senegal now?  Is it getting better?  I mean, there seems to be a lot of money coming in Dakar.  You see buildings going up, somebody\\'s building.  CAMARA:  The key thing for me will be the development of, uh, business\\n\\nand because when you look at all these young people in Saint-Louis and there is no companies to employ them.  Let the young people take a big part of the power, which is not in our tradition, but we need the young people to be, to be strong.\\n\\n[21:32:20] BOURDAIN:  If you could compare yourself to someplace else in, in another major city in the world, the New York of West Africa?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Hong Kong of West Africa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, oh, ouch.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nYes, you\\'re, you\\'re right.\\n\\n(WOMAN SINGING)\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:37:09] BOURDAIN:  Money.  You like it, I like it, we all like it, and there\\'s a flood of green pouring into the developing world. Green-head foreign speculators for sure, but also entrepreneurs, often educated abroad but returning to build businesses around a growing middle class.  Telecoms to financial institutions to the restaurants that grow up around them.  Maquis were once neighborhood, working- class dive bars.  Now many are becoming more respectable drinking establishments.  The Brooklynization of Africa begins.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nI join Pierre, his film producer\\'s brother Christian Cham, and their friend Papa Madiaw Ndiaye, a local business man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who is joining the middle class in Senegal?  Where are they coming from?\\n\\nPAPA MADIAW NDIAYE, BUSINESSMAN:  Most of the people are local people who now get proper training.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nNDIAYE:  And then you have a small group of guys like us who went abroad and are coming back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, a phenomenon that I have seen in other countries in West Africa was one where people leave either because of war, oppression, necessity, financial, education.  And when they come back, there is resentment.  How do they feel about people like you who go and then come back?\\n\\nNDIAYE:  You know, unlike most other places over here, there\\'s a tremendous amount of pride in your family.  Senegalese rarely go and just cut off.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Cut off, yes.  It\\'s true.  No, that\\'s true, but in addition to people who go, they send money back home.\\n\\nCHRISTIAN CHAM, FILM PROFESSOR:  There is more money coming from the immigrants than the money that we receive from the World Bank of IMF or anything like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why is this the case in Senegal?  Where does this attitude come from?\\n\\nNDIAYE:  It\\'s just the nature of the social fabric.  It\\'s not an individual -- individualistic society.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about the French colonial experience?  Uh, that too, was it different than --\\n\\nNDIAYE:  Very different from Senegal to the other countries.  Oh, it\\'s drastically different because the French used Senegal as their out -- as, as their anchor for their colonial expansion.  The French then said, \"Okay, you Senegalese, we\\'re going to train you up to, um, borderline high school education and you\\'re going to be the forefront -- the fulcrum of our, um, of our  administrative service.\"  So, if you go to Cote d\\'Ivoire, you go to Burkina, a lot of the guys who are running the, the, this administration were Senegalese.\\n\\nCHAM:  I think one of the major differences between Senegal and the other countries, not that we\\'re better or anything like that.  But, in Senegal it\\'s probably one of the only country in West Africa, probably in all Africa, where I can be from one a different ethnic group but we can talk without French using our local language and understand each other.  Because everybody speaks Wolof.\\n\\nNDIAYE:  I, I\\'m -- I happen to believe that, um, this world is going to be a better place when more cultures are actually given a chance to be put at the table.\\n\\n(DJILY BAGDAD PERFORMING)\\n\\nDJILY BAGDAD, MUSICIAN:  Each generation has its mission.  We have a saying in Wolof, we say, \"God is great.\"  And, you always say where there is no solution, you say.  And you leave it in the hand of God. But we, we tell people, \"This is in our hand.  This is our future and the future of the next generation coming.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As relatively good as things have been for Senegal democracy, as it turns out, requires regular maintenance, diligence needed, and the willingness to stand up.  Djily Bagdad is a musician and activist who\\'s doing what, well, the Last Poets and Chuck D. and others have done before him.  Say things that are important, loudly and often.  They call them \"Dibiteries\" and Dibi is generally grilled spiced lamb, hacked into pieces, and served on grease stained paper with grilled onions and mustard on the side.\\n\\nBAGDAD:  Wow! BOURDAIN:  That was quick.  From the beginning, I mean, was there\\n\\nalways this, like, a social justice, um, political component to what you were doing musically?\\n\\nBAGDAD:  From day one.  The first thing we did was go do a campaign called \"My Voting Card, My Weapon.\"  And we did songs and we did mobile concerts all over the country to raise awareness and it was the bum rush in the various spots.  Everybody went to register.  That\\'s, that\\'s the step that\\'s leaving us, you can see, that\\'s the step into being conscious of what your power is.\\n\\n[21:42:17] BOURDAIN:  In 2012, then President Abdoulaye Wade fell victim to the \"Maybe I Should Be President For Life\" syndrome that afflicts so many of his neighbors.  He proposed amending the constitution, so that he could run for a third term, as well as creating a new Vice Presidential position which many feared he intended for his son.  Djily, and many, many young people like him, were having  none of it.  They formed a group called \"Y\\'en A Marre,\" or \"Fed Up.\"  Using music as a draw and a hook they threw enormous rallies across the country, made aggressive and innovative use of social media, all in the cause of getting out the vote and shutting anti-Democratic initiatives down.  It worked.\\n\\nBAGDAD:  I know that, like, with this specific movement that we started and raising awareness I think the African union of people can start from here because this is amazing.  The new generation will learn from what we\\'ve done and maybe the next president might not be a politician at all.  You never know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Obvious question -- why don\\'t you run for office?\\n\\nBAGDAD:  I don\\'t know.  I\\'m not, I\\'m not -- I\\'m not an aspiring politician, not at all.  But I can see my help -- myself helpful for my community.  We have everything to emerge.  It\\'s about believing in ourselves and trusting ourselves that we can do it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:48:09] BOURDAIN:  Lac Rose, known for its pink hue and salt harvesters, sits near the Segalese Coast and, not too long ago, was also the finish line for a legendary trans-African endurance race.\\n\\nJEAN HAZARD (ph), PARIS-DAKAR RACER:  You OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I\\'m great.  No problem.\\n\\nDriving up to 10,000 grueling kilometers from Paris, south through Spain, across Morocco, down the Western Sahara, all the way to, well, right here.  The Paris-Dakar rally tested its drivers like no other race, sometimes driving over 20 hours a day over ground like this.\\n\\nSo, this is the same road the rally, Rally Dakar, took.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jean Hazard (ph) is a Senegalese of Lebanese descent who grew up here watching the final stretch of the race.  It was a galvanizing event for him.  He has since completed the race himself, three times.\\n\\nHAZARD:  So, when I was young, I came with my parents to see the arrival of the Paris-Dakar race.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHAZARD:  That\\'s why I like to, to make races.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s been eight years since specially modified, true off- road vehicles, with powerful engines and cutting edge designs, roared across the desert and through tiny African villages.\\n\\nI, of course, had to try out one of these beasts and it\\'s about much fun as you can have while wearing pants.\\n\\nHAZARD:  Like this.  It\\'s OK.  You can put the three if you want.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Three?\\n\\nHAZARD:  Very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, where am I going?\\n\\nHAZARD:  Turn, turn.  Nice, it\\'s nice, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just like this.\\n\\nHAZARD:  First time?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good pace.  Yes, it\\'s like driving in snow, huh?\\n\\nHAZARD:  Yes, yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After tear-assing around for a few hours, it\\'s traditionally chicken and beer on the beach.  We\\'re joined by Jean\\'s fellow Paris-Dakar racers -- Mame Lesse Diallo (ph) and Adbou Thiam (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My friend Mame Lesse made 12 times the Paris- Dakar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Twelve times.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Twelve with bike.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Motor bike.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Motor bike.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On a motor bike?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  So, what happened?  It stopped in, uh --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The last race was in \\'07, in \\'08, uh --  BOURDAIN:  2007?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  In, in, in 2008 we were at the start and we didn\\'t start.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We didn\\'t start.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They cancelled the, the race.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 2008, officials shut the event down with racers from all over the world at the starting line.  A response to the murder of four French citizens in Mauritania and to the discovery of potential terrorist threats against the race in the region.  The race, now called the Dakar-Rally, was moved off the African continent and currently runs much of the length of South America.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But will, will it come back?  What do you think?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here in Senegal?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Never.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I hope so!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Never.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?  Why?  Why never?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because these people, when they leave, they did I not in a fair way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you think they don\\'t deserve to have it back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But there\\'s still, is there still racing here within the country?  Within Senegal?  I mean, you race.\\n\\nHAZARD:  We have, after South Africa, the second circuit in all over Africa.  It\\'s very, very, very, important for us, for Africa, and it\\'s, uh, exceptional for us.  How do you like the chicken?  It\\'s OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.  It\\'s good.  Are you kidding me?  I\\'m hitting it hard.  So, you told me before that if I wanted to, I could get in a car and drive to Saint-Louis.\\n\\nHAZARD:  Uh-huh, just --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That way.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That way.\\n\\nHAZARD:  That way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long will it take?\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An hour and a half.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re going to Saint-Louis?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let me finish my chicken, then we\\'ll go.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:56:47] BOURDAIN:  Pierre Thiam\\'s Aunt Marie is the matriarch of the family.  She often hosts uncles, aunts, sons, and daughters, friends and relatives from near and abroad.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Teranga is hospitality, that\\'s the translation, but it\\'s, it\\'s, the, the most important value is really the way you treat the others.  Love, you receive love.  That\\'s what Teranga is.  So, today you are our guest so you\\'ll be treated with our national dish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everyone comes together often over this iconic dish. Thiebou Jen, which in Wolof means, simply, \"rice with fish.\"  It\\'s pretty much the national dish of Senegal.  Today it\\'s Senegalese grouper scored and stuffed with a mixture of garlic, parsley and peppers then slow simmered in a hearty tomato broth.  Infused with a funkatizing goodness brought by fermented conch and salt fish.  Served over rice and vegetables.\\n\\nI\\'m going to watch you and I\\'m going to do what you do.  That\\'s good.\\n\\nThe meal is eaten from one communal platter, an experience both fun and instructive.  Sustenance and life lesson.\\n\\nMmm.  Oh, that\\'s good.  Oh, that sauce is awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Normally children are not allowed to talk and to go too far in the middle of the plate.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So they go to eat around the edges?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So you, you will have an adult, the mother or an aunt or something, cutting pieces of fish or meat for them.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s a way to teach them to be content with their portion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nTHIAM:  You know?  Not only children, but everyone, you have to imagine that, the triangle in front of you and that\\'s the triangle that is your limit to the bowl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  And you have to chew slowly, you have to be patient.  So, all these values are taught when we eat around the bowl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, if I were looking for a metaphor for Senegalese society, this would be it?\\n\\nTHIAM:  This is it.  This is Senegalese society.\\n\\nSenegal is a special country.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few years back, I got the words, \"I am certain of nothing\" tattooed on my arm.  Is what makes travel what it is, an endless learning curve, the joy of being wrong, of being confused. Africa, more than any other continent, needs to be seen by the world as both the place we all came from and where we are going.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n[21:00:21] (SINGING IN GEORGIAN)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\":  To Georgia.\\n\\n(SHA-LA-LA-ING PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Georgia is probably a place you don\\'t know much about.  Few Americans, I suspect, could place it on a map.  It\\'s small compared to the super around it but vital.  Its significance far exceeding its relative size.  For nearly 70 years, it was a Soviet Republic, and since independence in 1991, Georgia has been on a wild and often deeply troubled ride as it struggles to obtain and maintain democracy. There has been a civil war, regional strife, and numerous provocations and invasions by Russia.  Geopolitically, it\\'s located in a hot spot, a strategic crossroads surrounded by Russia, Turkey, Armenia, oil- producing Azerbaijan and just a short distance away Syria and Iran.\\n\\nI wanted very much to see Georgia, but in November of 2015, I was having a very tough time getting there.  The hard realities of a television production schedule required me to be in Georgia\\'s shiny new version of Vegas on the sea, Batumi, but here I was stuck in Istanbul.  Hurricane-like weather conditions grounded my flight on the other side of the sea.  It\\'s an unforgiving medium, television.  And a first principle is that one minute you\\'re on top of the world, next minute replaced by a younger, prettier face.  Somebody hungrier with fire in their belly.\\n\\nZAMIR:  To, to, to, to, to bah live from Batumi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I knew just such a person.  Someone who\\'d been hungering for my job for ages.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m talking about Zamir, of course.  Only a short flight away in Moscow and ready at a drop of a hat to jump on a plane and be my eyes and ears in Batumi.  I may have misrepresented things a little bit.  I may have promised him a reoccurring role in the show.  But I needed somebody on the ground, and I needed him quickly.\\n\\nZAMIR:  This is CNN.\\n\\n(CLEARING THROAT)\\n\\nWhen the producers of the American television program, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\" telephoned me and explained that I wouldn\\'t have to pay for anything I took from the mini bar, I was confident this was the break I was waiting for.  Maybe this was the glorious future for me in cable news.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CREW MEMBER:  Can you go a little bit to your right, Zamir?  Right -- a little more.\\n\\nZAMIR:  But just when my -- for becoming next Wolf Blitzer are about to come true, Tony arrives, smashing my hopes on the reef of television broken dreams.\\n\\nPlease, feel at home now, like it\\'s Georgia.  And now, it could be another state, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know.  How did you get here?  What, via what route?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Luckily, there was a direct flight twice a week through Moscow to Batumi.\\n\\n[21:05:13] BOURDAIN:  Two and a half hours, that\\'s all?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, just --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ugh, all right, what are we drinking, Zamir?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Do you feel like you\\'re rea for some tropical feel?  Because I have some surprise of Cha-Cha.  It\\'s like moonshine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay, yes, I\\'ll have -- I\\'ll try that because apparently, apparently I\\'m going to be drinking a lot of it while I\\'m in Georgia. This is I understand a --\\n\\nZAMIR:  It\\'s a part of local hospitality, but it\\'s over 40 degrees like alcohol proof, so welcome to Georgia.  Hope it will be an interesting trip for you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  If we were to go to a casino tonight, for instance, what do you think?\\n\\nZAMIR:  What is your game of choice?  Poker?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, maybe or --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Blackjack.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Roulette, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Roulette.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Maybe, roulette would be --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Craps.\\n\\nZAMIR:  That\\'s -- that\\'s quick.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Baccarat, James Bond played baccarat.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Not that good at that, but let\\'s see what they have.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not much going on in Batumi off-season as it turns out. The casinos are still going for the benefit mostly of Turkish dudes hopping across the border from their country where such vices are frowned upon.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Seventeen, 14, 16, 13.

There\\'s that great philosopher Wesley Snipes once said, \"Always bet on black.\" Going all in, Zamir.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nZAMIR:  Okay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come on black.  Come on, black.  Yes!\\n\\nZAMIR:  It\\'s a good start, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let it ride.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Run, rabbit, run.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ouch.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nZAMIR:  You need some nightlife.  I mean, the losers deserve some relieve, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, nothing like a loser in a nightclub and I emanate loser, so let\\'s go.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Let\\'s go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Unsurprisingly, Zamir and I suck at gambling with a force equivalent to a thousand suns.  I should have just pulled my pants down and handed over my money the second we walked into the door.  But actually, that came later.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m memorized by this bowl of electronic snakes.  Oh, they\\'re changing colors, either that or I have a brain hemorrhage.\\n\\nZAMIR:  No, they\\'re changing colors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, everything seems fine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, Larina, Raki, Raki, yes, Raki -- two Rakies.  Tony, maybe it\\'s time to think of a New Year\\'s resolution once you have inspiring moment.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTony, this is an interesting moment in my life.  I\\'m trying to get something going on and I want to go crazy with you tonight --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happed -- you grew up in Turkey?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:12:35] BOURDAIN:  Batumi in daytime is a strange looking place. Not exactly forlorn off-season, just odd.  A mix of what are obviously big dreams and current realities.  What is going on here?  They\\'re building everywhere -- commercial and residential properties rising up out of the ground every few yards.  It goes on and on.  I meet up with Zamir at Sazandari, one of the cities older, more traditional joints.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Tony.  How are you feeling?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like something crawled inside my head and defecated and then died.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Listen, I think we\\'re getting old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Getting?  Although, you\\'re looking very svelte I have to say, I\\'m impressed.\\n\\nZAMIR:  I -- you\\'re kidding me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, you look good up on that pole.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Now listen, if we are on the Black list again, I think that\\'s the end of my career, but you know --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was a brief, but magnificent pole-dancing career I can tell you.  You went out in a flame of glory.\\n\\nZAMIR:  I wasn\\'t aware they\\'re so puritan kind of, you know, country and people are kind of, you know, I thought they had some sense of humor, but --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hair of the dog.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yep, hmm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, we\\'re eating, what\\'s --\\n\\nZAMIR:  Well, actually traditionally, you know, Georgia is the man\\'s world.  I mean, men drink, eat, party and the women normally do know how to make people healthy and alive next morning after heavy drinking.  So Khashi, it\\'s kind of broth and it\\'s made of beef bones an joints, so the whole idea is just to suck out whatever alcohol still remains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s a hangover soup?\\n\\nZAMIR:  It\\'s hangover soup.  BOURDAIN:  Oh yes, there\\'s tripe in there.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, all the joints.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is not the first thing I think of for hangover actually.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Oh, really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Maybe this will help.\\n\\nZAMIR:  It goes well with garlic.  You tried it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I just dumped a whole bunch of garlic in there.\\n\\nZAMIR:  You think it\\'s marketable in the states as a real hangover dish -- a thing that should be a lot of clientele?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hmmm, no.\\n\\nZAMIR:  No, not really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Khashi is not really working for me, but I absolutely love the Shahashuli (ph), the stew of slow-cooked veal with onion and tomato, heavily seasoned with coriander, fennel, garlic and chilies. Spicy!  I mean, it\\'s really like got some good zing in there.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, feeling better?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I am.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what has the club called offering you a job?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Not yet.  I mean, there\\'s very tough competition on that front.  To Georgia -- a local toast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As grateful as I am for him stepping in my time of need, it\\'s time for Zamir to head back off to Moscow.  I ain\\'t no fool -- the man clearly wants my job.  Tbilisi, in the Eastern part of the country, is Georgia\\'s capital city and it\\'s very different in every respect from Batumi\\'s off-season amusement park vibe.  It\\'s an old city founded in the 5th Century but also a very new city.  1.2 million people building their own world freshly emerged from some very, very dark times.  It\\'s a pretty incredible story, strong, rock-solid Orthodox hell of a lot of years under the Soviet boot, years of totally Wild West gangster-ism, endemic corruption.  Now, it\\'s a very different story.  Tbilisi is changing fast.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t know what it says about a place that since I\\'ve  arrived in this country, I\\'ve been in a literally a constant state of, I\\'m either drinking or hung-over.\\n\\nPAUL RIMPLE, JOURNALIST:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or both.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that normal?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  That\\'s normal, yes, especially for visitors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re friendly here.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  But it\\'s a friendly kidnapping, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I actually -- I\\'ve read accounts of people who\\'ve actually were kidnapped in this country, who --\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, yes.  It happened once with, uh, U.N. monitors --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They came back like ten pounds heavier and hung-over?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  They -- they found them in a cabin up in the mountains partying.  They had bumped into a wedding party and were there for two days.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how long have you lived here?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Oh, about 12 years, 12, 13 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you\\'ve been hung-over for 12 years?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, yes.  Pretty much.\\n\\n[21:17:11] BOURDAIN:  Paul Rimple is an American-born journalist and he\\'s seen it all.  He takes me to Tbilisi\\'s old city to eat at the Gabriadze Cafe.  When you first arrived, who was -- who was running things back then?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Eduard Shevardnadze.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, those were -- so the bad old days.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, and it\\'s a real mixed legacy because the nation was still functioning as an outlaw ex-Soviet, you know, nation.  Then, Saakashvili just, kind of, emerged and the Rose Revolution happened, you know, and everything changed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The country has run through a number of heads of states since the end of Soviet rule.  First, was the former Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Union, Eduard Shevardnadze who was ousted in 2003.  But to get a handle on Georgia today, you must understand the importance of one man.  Mikheil Saakashvili.  After Shevardnadze, he was elected president in 2004 and began to change everything.  Misha, as everybody knew him, transformed the country. And by making friends in the West, in Europe, and the U.S., he gained a lot of attention, both good and bad.  In 2013 though, he was ousted by the Georgian dream party who are still in power today.\\n\\nMost Americans watching this show will have a hard time even locating Georgia on a map.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think people need to know about this country?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Two things in Georgia that are untouchable -- the church. Don\\'t mess with the church and don\\'t mess with Georgian food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t mess with Georgian food?\\n\\nPAUL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t mess with the church -- okay, I get it.  But to the food, why?\\n\\nPAUL:  Because, um, it\\'s tradition.  You don\\'t mess with tradition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m quickly finding that the cuisine here is really good -- really complex with sweet, sour notes that are reminiscent of, I don\\'t know.  I just know that it feels hauntingly familiar yet, utterly new and delicious.  Salad with orange, almonds and honey.  Grilled lamb ribs with tomograt (ph) sauce.  Slices of fried eggplant wrapped around a walnut filling.  And chkmeruli -- chicken slow baked in an oven and then simmered in garlic and milk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mmm, that\\'s good.\\n\\nPAUL:  And Georgians will tell you, there\\'s no alcoholics in Georgia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No alcoholics.  Right.  Do you believe that?\\n\\nPAUL:  Absolutely not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do I get out of drinking?  How do I avoid chugging Cha- Cha?\\n\\nPAUL:  Say you have a heart condition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A heart condition?\\n\\nPAUL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nothing short of that will help?\\n\\nPAUL:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jeez.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:23:52] BOURDAIN:  There it is, perched on a hilltop overlooking the capital, like the liar of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the bond arch villain.  Helipad, check.  Private zoo, check.  A big, shimmering glass box owned by Georgia\\'s richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili.  Known variously as \"the good oligarch,\" and as the mysterious guiding hand behind, well, everything.  Seldom seen in public, Ivanishvili, after making billions in Russia, went into politics in his homeland, creating the Georgia dream party and ultimately becoming prime minister in 2012.  Not everybody is on board, however.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The demonstration ended several minutes ago. Concrete demands of the participants were the Georgian government has to stop.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Russian gas is expensive.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Russian gas is not --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Gazprom is Putin\\'s weapon of blackmail.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Known as the Angry Bird, Tamara Chergoleishvili and her Pro-western decidedly anti-Russian defend liberty coalition, are in vocal opposition.  Recently, a move by the ruling party to sign a deal with Russia\\'s Gazprom for all Georgia\\'s oil needs, has caused dissention.  We meet at Sofia Melnikovas -- a much-loved bistro for the most loved, perhaps most iconic Georgian dish, Khinkali.  I understand that Georgia is not releasing, but looking around, compared to 2008, life looks good.  There\\'s money in the streets, shiny new cars.\\n\\nTAMARA CHERGOLEISHVILI, GEORGIAN POLITICIAN:  No, well, the thing is that, yes, things have changed.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia was the country that suffered the most among the former Soviet Republic\\'s economically.  And our economy totally collapsed, corruption, like, became like just the normal way of living.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Truly a pretty miraculous transformation, unlike --\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Yes, well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Anyplace.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  It happened because, like, people wanted it, I mean, and there was this demand.  That\\'s why revolution took place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh man, look at that.  Wow, that looks sensational.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Big, fat, juicy soup dumplings filled with spicy cumin- jacked minced beef in a hot, rich, potentially scalding broth.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  You have never tried that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have never.  No, I\\'m new to this country.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  According to tradition --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  You\\'re eating it with fingers.  BOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  That\\'s the whole thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm, so good.  Oh wow, these are terrific.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  I mean, this not something very sophisticated to eat.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm, who cares?  This is a very religious country -- people identify themselves closely with Christianity.  Family based.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And there seems to be a point beyond which the population will not go and to come around to comrade Putin, um, he seems to understand this very, very well.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  The way Putin operations is that, like, first Putin emanates strength.  I mean, he\\'s a bad guy.  I mean, there\\'s a consensus.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Like 80 percent of Georgians, like, believe that Putin is a very bad guy and Russians as well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, but he\\'s on the winning side.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Yes, exactly so he\\'s a winner, so they don\\'t judge winners.  They say, \"Okay, we\\'re bad, but West is worse.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But are they wrong?\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Of course they are wrong.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wherever you find a traditional, religious, conservative society, you\\'ll find a countervailing force.  Georgians, as a rule, are compassionate about tradition, about the way things are supposed to be done.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean that there aren\\'t rebels -- people pushing hard against the status quo.  Daring, creative souls like Chef Tekuna Gachechiladze.  At Culinarium, she\\'s taking to extremes the notion that Georgian food is in fact the fusion of all the past influences of the many forces who made their way, and forced their way, through the tiny country.  She\\'s focused on the next generation.\\n\\n[21:28:40] BOURDAIN:  Something that was said to me early on, what I need to know about Georgia is, don\\'t speak badly of, uh, religion and don\\'t mess with the food.\\n\\nTEKUNA GACHECHILADZE, CHEF:  For me, without innovation, tradition will die.  Because we can\\'t -- we can\\'t eat the same dishes what we used to eat in the beginning of the century because then, people did go for the hunt for two weeks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Now, we\\'re sitting in front of computer and we can\\'t take so much fat.  It needs some lighter version of it and I\\'m trying to modernize Georgia cookings.  I think you\\'re hungry, so now I have to go cook.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThis is the cream soup with the caramelized onions and then salt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really good.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  It\\'s really good for a hang-over.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s good because I have a hangover.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Uh, eat some more soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I could eat this all day.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  And then we\\'re going to drink Cha-Cha and you don\\'t have a hangover at all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On my way to a new one.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  This is Georgia, you know, you have a hangover.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m learning every day.\\n\\nTEKUNA:  You cure yourself every day and then the next day, you still have a hangover and then you cure yourself.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh my God, I mean, having a --\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  I think we have to do one shot.  It\\'s going to help you and it\\'s going to help me.  And some wild trout tartare.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is delicious.  So, when you first started departing from the classics, what was the reaction from people?\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  What do you think?  It was big, like, um, controversial.  Even my grandmother, she\\'s like when I make her try this new thing, she\\'s like, \"Why?  Why do you have to do this?\"  And this is the very popular dish, chakapuli and then from lacos chakapuli, I\\'m trying to make people eat mussels.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Because the mussel is not very popular.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re beautiful mussels, too.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Yes, we have very good mussels.  But we need now and one more shot, so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there some Georgian dishes that should never change?\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  I always feeling very strongly to preserving the regional dishes.  It\\'s good to have this original version --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  -- but I\\'m giving the other option to try something new.  In my vision, it\\'s always to have a choice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look, it\\'s a beautiful city.  It\\'s in the countryside. It\\'s fantastic.  People are nice and the food is really extraordinary, really, really something special.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  It is, it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The drinking, however, is a problem.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Drinking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Cheers.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:19] BOURDAIN:  Tbilisi is one thing -- an increasingly modern city.  Smart cafes, boutique hotels, shops, galleries, the inevitable spoor of hipsters.  But outside the city, it\\'s not so different than it always was.  Agrarian, traditional, things done the way they\\'ve always been done.  The way it\\'s believed they should be done, until you reach the bizarre world along the border.  Only 90 kilometers northwest from Tbilisi in villages like one, Khurvaleti, where tiny Georgia\\'s predicament, comes clearly and brutally into focus.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nOver there, the Russian-controlled breakaway region, formally Georgian of South Ossetia.\\n\\nThe Russians took it in a five-day war in 2008.  It\\'s Russia now. This side of the wire is, at this precise moment anyway, Georgia, but who knows?  The border has been known to inch forward unpredictably. Often in the dead of night to the point that families have gone to sleep in Georgia and woken to find themselves living in Russia, swallowed up overnight.  Before 2008, Khurvaleti was home to more than 60 families.  Today, just nine families are left hanging on.\\n\\nDIMA BIT-SULEIMAN, GEORGIAN JOURNALIST:  So that cow is in South Ossetia, both of them.  There was story actually on that, an old lady basically woke up and her cow appeared to be on the other side of the fence because they did it during tonight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  And so she would walk up every morning and would milk cows through the fence to get her milk.  It can\\'t be that bad, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Journalist and fixer, Dima Bit-Suleiman covered the war here seven years ago and continues to report from the region.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  So like that house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They had the misfortune to go to sleep in Georgia and wake up in Russia.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  Exactly.  But look at this.  This is where the Russians sit and that is the base.  Probably a communication base, but they\\'re probably now watching us and the sign says, \"Attention, state border,\" so that\\'s something that appeared recently.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thoughtfully, in English.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  The main problem to me is that we\\'re like a couple kilometers away from the highway.  Moving this border and blocking this highway would stop all the activity in the country basically. So, right now, the Caspian oil and gas goes through Georgia, and that\\'s the only route, except Russia and bypassing Russia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s an implied threat, you know?\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  That\\'s the main thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s saying, \"If I can do this, I can certainly go all the way right to highway at which point\" --\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  Basically, there\\'s a pipeline just here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, this is really a hand around your throat.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  Absolutely, every day.  That\\'s why every 50 meters or even meter, which may be not that important for the whole country, like shorthand economic point of view.  It doesn\\'t matter, right? But, in terms of political threat, every meter is another step toward catastrophe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re here for a supra at the home of Ushangi (ph) and Makvala Kokashvili.  A supra is like a feast, super traditional.  A pig is dispatched and broken into constituent parts.  The neighbors pitch in, helping to make three different varieties of a traditional cheese-filled bread, known as khachapuri, variously stuffed here with potato, beet leaves and stewed cabbage.\\n\\nDIMA:  And there\\'s one thing that we always do in Georgia.  We eat fresh herbs always and this is homemade wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is, I gather, a very formal structure to these toasts.  DIMA:  Quite.  For the few, uh, few toasts at least, seven-ish I would\\n\\nsay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You sort of lose the plot after seven.\\n\\nDIMA:  No, no.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSeven is not a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s how a typical supra works.  It\\'s more formal than it looks.  Custom must be observed, certain rituals performed.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want to say a toast for families.\\n\\n[21:40:06] BOURDAIN:  Proceedings are led by the Tamada, or toastmaster, often the head of the house.  The big-cheese, the dude but always the guy with the best rhetorical skills and the guy best able to stay sober while all around him are, well, not.  Because, there\\'s a lot of drinking in a supra.  It\\'s required.  In this case, our hosts have called upon Igor, their next-door neighbor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After each toast, your glass of wine or Cha-Cha, God forbid, must, and I mean must, be drained completely and refilled to the rim.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We must always remember and glorify our ancestry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re toasting some pretty heartfelt, serious shit here, so hang in there and show some respect.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let\\'s remember them and drink to those who have passed away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is tough because the drink receptacles can grow larger as the toasts progress.  To like this horn for instance.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A toast for peace.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is used because you can\\'t, even if you wanted to, put it down anything less than empty because it will pour all the table. So, drink up!  Then, there\\'s a mug and so on.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let us always see the peaceful united country.  A toast for Georgia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To Georgia.  Then it\\'s time for the food.  Roast, stuffed goose.  Wow, look at that.  And shashlik -- grilled kebabs of pork with a sour plum sauce.  There\\'s also qorma, a slow-cooked stew of the pig\\'s heart and liver with onions, bay leaves and parsley.  It\\'s good bread.  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nDIMA:  If we have a choice, we prefer west to Russia because the future for our children is much better there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But they\\'re still here.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nDIMA:  We\\'re not afraid.  They\\'re here, but we sleep peacefully. Without -- without fear.  And he says they can and will be here. We\\'ll meet them here.  It\\'s been six years we couldn\\'t go to the graves.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m a grown man, I\\'m not afraid of anything.  And I never cry but that day six years when I could no longer visit my father\\'s grave, I cried.  A toast for our children.\\n\\nMy God give them a long life, and health.  A toast for your child.  My God raise her wealthy and to be as you wish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ugh, I don\\'t think -- I don\\'t think I can do this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When toasting little ones, you must drink the whole glass.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You have to drink it all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m working on it, I\\'ll get there, I\\'ll get there.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:47:33] BOURDAIN:  The wine region of Georgia is called Kakheti, a beautiful area East of Tbilisi made up of foothills and valleys below Caucasus Mountain.  In a hilltop village of Signage, there\\'s a well- known restaurant called Pheasants Tears.  The chef is a local guy, Gia Rokashvili, who works with what\\'s from the area.  Nothing too fancy, but always soulful and delicious and always served with local wines.\\n\\nKETI BOCHORISHVILI, DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMY, GEORGIA:  I like to show off my country.  You know, I want to sometimes scream, \"Look! This is my country.  Come and visit.\"  And maybe it\\'s part of my culture, parts of my personality, yes, we are just proud of our country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, you should know this about me and the people I work with -- we don\\'t like working with officials.  We avoid tourists boards, official advisors, government employees.  We certainly don\\'t hang out with ministers of the countries we are shooting in, who always, always have an agenda and always want to skew our perspective on our subject.  But Keti Bochorishvili is an exception.  She is the Deputy Mister of Economy.  A remarkable woman, more remarkable for the fact that she is unique holdover from the previous administration. She goes on and on, never stopping in her efforts to convince the world that Georgia -- Georgia -- is the place to be.  And if you spend any time with this ferociously smart woman and her friend, gallery owner Tamuna Gvaberidze, you will understand and forgive us all, all of us on the crew for becoming completely beguiled.  I like the food already.  Love the food.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  Okay, good.  Food you like.  I hope wine, you like, and then if you like skin, then that\\'s the place.\\n\\nTAMUNA GVABERIDZE, FRIEND OF KETI BOCHORISHVILI:  And you have to dance also, Georgian dances.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  I\\'m a really, really appalling dancer.  This is a problem for me.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  No, no, no you don\\'t do that.  You know you want to.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, I\\'m frightened.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  Two or three glasses of Cha-Cha and you\\'re ready to dance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Enough Cha-Cha, anything is possible.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  I\\'m going to toast, take the break, ah, let\\'s toast for the -- I\\'m spontaneously thinking right now to achieve our goals and dreams.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To dreams.  The ladies convinced us to make the 90-minute drive to this village and this restaurant and, well, I\\'m quite happy they did.  By the time I\\'ve had some more of that delicious and lethal Cha-Cha, and many glasses of delicious Georgian wine, after boiled beets in a wild plum sauce, and freshly foraged mushrooms with chili pepper and mint and tarragon, baby lamb stewed in its own fat with cumin and cooked together with wild rice biryani style.  And delicious, delicious Tonis Puri.  Bread straight out of the outdoor tandoor-like clay oven.  After all this, I am convinced.  I am co- opted, I am recruited.  Count me as a useful idiot, a witting agent of the Georgian Ministry of Tourism, for I may as well be.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  But, um, I have to underline also that Georgian people are very optimistic, very cheerful.  They always see, you know, future in a very, and that drives the, you know, drives them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Optimism.  Not a lot of it in this world right now.  I visit a lot of countries.  People are unusually helpful and friendly here.  Um, how should I put this?  People are really good looking here.\\n\\nIt is -- it\\'s sort of thing you notice.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  Do you know who you look like?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  The director, American.  David Lynch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m David Lynch, really?  He has better hair.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  I\\'m so happy he says he likes Georgia, really.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why would I not?\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  You\\'re becoming a Georgian.  Be careful.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWe are all humans and we all love each other so we can sit around a table and we can just love each other.  And especially, with the help of wine, we can love more.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  You know, Georgians also like to drink for peace because peace was so important in our lives.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  I think we need to change the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To freedom.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  OK, so now it\\'s your turn to say the toast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To this extraordinary place that has managed against all odds to endure all these years against so many powerful forces.  To two magnificent women.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  Thank you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:56:02] BOURDAIN:  In this nifty neighborhood, just up the hill from downtown Tbilisi, is where Giorgi Gelovani is hosting a dinner. The food\\'s being prepared by Meriko Gubeadze (ph), the chef of the city\\'s beloved Black Line Brasserie.  And it\\'s going to be epic.\\n\\nGIORGI GELOVANI, MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS, GEORGIA:  I hope you find this --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s really good.\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Not too salty for you?  Because we love salted cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, so do I.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s great for your hangover.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They say that about a lot of things here, I notice.\\n\\nA variety of Georgian appetizers served pre-dinner, kind of like mezza.  Spinach with walnuts and wild capers, pickled carrots, cheese curds with roasted hazelnuts and mint, roasted eggplant seasoned with coriander.  This thing, this thing is amazing.  Kharsho, a stewed chicken cooked slow with ajika chili sauce, onions and an oft-used Georgian spices -- marigold flower powder and blue fenugreek.  So a lot of what we\\'ve been talking about since we got here, is, will\\n\\nGeorgia continue to look west or will it, as the Russians would prefer, look to the East?\\n\\nGELOVANI:  It\\'s not like the last 200 years or something.  It\\'s the -- throughout the existence of Georgia, even though we were surrounded and our immediate neighbors were Turkish, Persian, Arab, or whomever else, or Russian, okay.  The -- so the bias has always been towards, with Europe rather than with the East.  We believe that we are a part of that culture.  However, distant we might have actually been.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By regional standards, people don\\'t lower their voices here when they give you their opinion, more or less.  Okay, it is as --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We never did.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Honestly speaking, I think we\\'ve done better than, than many of the Soviet Republics.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what will it be like in ten years?  I mean, are you optimistic?\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Absolutely.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I\\'m always optimistic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Optimistic?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mildly optimistic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not so optimistic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not so, yes.  If -- I would say, if Georgia is still independent, I\\'m very optimistic.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Okay.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All right the next one is --\\n\\nGELOVANI:  And the next one is supposed to be for the children, right? Come on!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Or the life.\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Or life, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To dreamers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dreamers.\\n\\n(SINGING IN GEORGIAN)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Polyphonic songs are pure Georgia.  Eerily reminiscent, though, of mariachi music.  They\\'re about pre-Christian things -- things that have always been here since the beginning like wind and forests and forest spirits and lost love.  Hauntingly beautiful and otherworldly -- kind of like Georgia.\\n\\n(SINGING IN GEORGIAN)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n[21:00:19] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  Some people must live in great spaces where the sky goes on forever.  Where everyone must bend to the land.  Where to hunt, to fish, to sleep under that big sky aren\\'t activities, but a way of life.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was right here in those mountains that Cheyenne and Crow battle took place, but I like it.  It\\'s very peaceful, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was it like a hundred years ago?  Two hundred years ago?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much different.  This was never forested. This is the dry side of the river because the primary winds come from the west.  Rain tends to blow over here that brings the snow to the mountains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Legendary writer and poet Jim Harrison is one of those people and this is his home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Am I as old as I am?  Maybe not.  Time is an industry that could tip us upside down.  Yesterday I was seven in the woods.  A bandage covered my blind eye.  Sixty eight years ago later I could still inhabit that boy\\'s body.  I start thinking about a time in between.  It is the burden of life to be in the ages without seeing the end of time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Next time you turn off a news cycle filled with shouting bobble-heads convinced that America is devolving into a moronic inferno, questioning the greatness of your nation, maybe you should come here.  Here are your purple mountains majesty.  This is the landscape, the generations dreamers, despots, adventurers, explorers, crack pots and heroes fought and died for.  It\\'s one of the most beautiful places on earth.  There is no place like it.  Montana.  Many have come to claim their piece over the years, but before the prospectors and explorers there were the plains Indians.  The Absarika (ph) have been master horsemen since they adopted Spanish-introduced mustangs in the 18th Century.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  General Black Jack Pershing.  He called the Native Americans the centaurs of the plains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Better known as the Crow they were once part of the larger Hadassah Tribe.  Centuries ago they split off on their own and wandered or were pushed by conflict with the Blackfeet, Cheyenne and Dakota until settling here in the Yellowstone River Valley.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That horse became everything to our people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kennard Real Bird (ph) grew up ranching and raising horses here at medicine tail coulee which happens to be the exact spot where General George Custer had the worst day of his life.  Kennard raises horses for rodeo, the riding and for this, Indian relay racing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The athletic ability on them kids are just amazing.  The competition is intense.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They travel all over to compete at this collarbone smashing, skull cracking, bones snappingly dangerous sport.  Former allies and former blood enemies alike.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It requires a lot of courage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll bet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And a high threshold for pain.  It\\'s representative of a warrior mentality.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One rider, three horses.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And they\\'re lined up and gun goes off.  It\\'s like a spontaneous combustion.\\n\\n[21:05:12] BOURDAIN:  Top speed is around 40 miles an hour and after each lap the rider dismounts at full freaking gallop and leaps hopefully on to the next horse.  Yes, it\\'s as dangerous and difficult as it looks.  The prizes at big events run into the thousands of dollars, but really, it\\'s about bragging rights.  And pride.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being in motion, in rhythm in time and in one, the death horse, they develop strength of character, and once they conquer that fear, that feeling of accomplishment is so great, when they walk back from that race they have this sense of pride and self-worth of sky high.  Now they\\'ve identified with their ancestors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ken\\'s wife Diane has prepared a lunch of buffalo steaks, potato salad, fry bread and Indian pudding made of Juneberry stewed with flour and sugar.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When I looked at my ancestors, they didn\\'t have diabetes and they didn\\'t have much cancer.  They were very strong, durable people, and I said, well, I\\'m going to start eating nothing, but buffalo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Over the course of your life, how much has this area changed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Quite a bit.  We went and picked up a four-wheeler last Sunday.  It\\'ll be the first four-wheeler on the place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Given those changes, what are the crow people going to be doing in 20 years?  Thirty years?  The horse is going to play an important part of the culture still?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think so, yes.  Because what\\'s a place going to be like without horses?  I wouldn\\'t want to be there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who owns this land?  Can anyone really own it?  Who gets to use it?  These are big questions that cut across traditional ideological lines out here where they have real meaning, not theoretical meaning.  All this belongs to one man.  This guy.  Bill Galt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re about a half mile from the confluence of rock creek and the Smith River.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Galt ranch is 100,000 acres of grazing land, mountains, cliffs and valleys.  There\\'s also some of the best trout fishing on the planet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bill, the water level on the creek looks good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Bill\\'s friend, the author and journalist David McCumber.  They disagree on land use, a major issue.  Remember when you could do that and still be friends?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lee Kinsey is a professional outfitter who bill leases some areas of his property to for fishing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All this to outwit a fish?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  Go ahead and just let that tip high just straight up in the air.  Good.  Perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bill\\'s fifth generation Montana, whose principal business is raising cattle.  He\\'s no weekend cowboy.  This is work and he pays a lot of attention to his land and a big issue for him and for just about everybody around here is the 1984 stream access law.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anybody that could access a stream via a public means could, in fact, use the stream even if it was private ground as long as they stayed within the ordinary high watermark of the stream.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Widely heralded by sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts, the law did not go down well with landowners like Bill.\\n\\nOh, got him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Something took a bite.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He\\'s still got a fish right in there, too.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, I see him.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Perfect! Hoop set, set!  Whoa!  Fish of the day.\\n\\nNice brownie.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right!  Beautiful thing! That\\'s pretty, but I will not eat you today, my friend.  Not today.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For lunch, a modest protein-centric repast of steak, a wagyu Angus hybrid bred and raised right here on Bill\\'s ranch.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s the marbling on the wagyu steak.  That\\'s what makes them good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s nice.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s pretty damn tasty, I can tell you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you hold an opposing view, is that correct, on access?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The idea behind the stream access law that if you stay in water, it\\'s public.  I agree with that concept.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But where do you draw the line for private property risk? If the state were to pass a law that your restroom was public because of the public needed it in your house.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But just because this isn\\'t my backyard doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t isn\\'t any less mine than your toilet is yours.  We still pay taxes on every foot of it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m an old school lefty, you got to say, I kind of completely understand the property owner\\'s point of view here.  There would be no ambiguity in my feeling if I inherited this land and it had been in my family for generations and I looked around at it and wanted to keep people like it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If I were to go at a bar in town, and then I would ask, how do you feel about this issue, where would it break?  What do most people say?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Orlando.  Certainly divided right now in the middle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A lot of people are going to say, when I was a kid I used to be able to go hunt and fish.  And I can\\'t now, stuff is getting closed up.  I have some sympathy for that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anybody that\\'s not complying has come access merely has to step into the stream when he hears you coming.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  The spirit of it makes sense.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The spirit of it is thievery.  We own it and I took it and it\\'s not stealing it without compensation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s still here.\\n\\n[21:10:35] BOURDAIN:  This isn\\'t about being a good neighbor.  Right? I mean, so, if people ask nicely more often than not, you\\'re going to say yes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.  We used to be --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Before stream access, we sort of required somebody to have commission if they just behave themselves.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  After stream access is when the outfitters came into the world not because we wanted to make money, but we wanted somebody there patrolling and policing it.  The outfitters take care of it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A small stream like this can only take so much pressure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Really.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And so, we try to manage it and fish it  responsibly, if somebody wants to walk all the way from the Smith five miles  up to here and do it legally, I say all of the more power to them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what I\\'m saying.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:14:31] BOURDAIN:  At first look, you\\'d think this is the worst place on earth.  A ravaged, toxics, God-forsaken hill threatened from above, riddled with darkness below, but you\\'d be wrong.  Butte, Montana.  It is, in fact, heartbreakingly, poignantly beautiful.  The gallous frames seem eyesores for only a second before it becomes clear why they\\'re points of fierce pride for locals for whom they signify and commemorate anything.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For Montanas, many people consider it sort of a black eye.  I happen to think it\\'s sort of the essence of Montana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aaron Parrett was born in Butte.  He\\'s a professor of literature and a chronicler of the city\\'s colorful literary history.\\n\\nThere is something beautiful about this city, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  The enduring decay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like in Detroit or a buffalo or a Cleveland, you can see the aspirations of the builders or the people who they were building for.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As I\\'ve gotten older I kind of think about it the way Europeans romanticized those ruins in Greece and Rome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beat us.  America is a crapulous (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In its heyday, Butte produced tens of billions of dollars\\' worth of copper that built, well, America.  That helped power the country, defended against Germany and Japan.  Without this hill, no copper wire, no electricity.  At the turn of the century, Marcus Daly\\'s amalgamated company consumed its competitors and became anaconda copper.  By the \\'20s, the company as it\\'s referred to was one of the largest corporations in America.  Generating staggering wealth by todays\\' or any days standards.  People came from all over the world to make their fortunes here or simply for steady work, a better life.\\n\\nCornish, Welsh, a lot of Eastern Europeans.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Croatians, Serbs, very ethnically diverse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By Montana standards or by any standards?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say by any standards, it\\'s kind of a micro version of New York City.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Meaderville was an Italian neighborhood and developed a tradition of supper clubs.  Lidia\\'s was opened in 1946 by Linda Michelet (ph) in the Fourmile, the valley below Butte.\\n\\nSo what is a supper club?  I\\'ve heard about this tradition, but I don\\'t really understand what distinguisher a supper club from a restaurant.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At least in Montana the supper clubs are a variation on Meaderville-style involves this anti-pasto beginning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sliced beats, sweet potato salad, salami and cheese, side salad, pickled peppers and breadsticks.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And then when you actually get your entree, you get oddly enough get ravioli or spaghetti or here both, but also French fries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Odd.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That may be unique to Montana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For Ontre, huge scallops and white wine sauce - me noticing were pretty much -- around here, I go for the extra thick tenderloin of beef, thank you very much.  This is whacky.  It makes no sense.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is somewhat bizarre to have scallops and French fries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Meaderville no longer around?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, it\\'s not.  It was followed up by the pit in the early 60s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For the 70 years, it was hard rock mining blasting and digging tunnels deep into the ground, by the 1950s mining was moving increasingly to above ground, open pit which meant fewer jobs and a bigger, more visible footprint.  By 1955, the Berkeley pit had become the largest open-pit copper mine in the world.  As it expanded it devoured Meaderville and surrounding neighborhoods.  There was money down there to be dug out of the ground and that\\'s what Butte had always been about from the beginning.\\n\\nIn 1983, the pumps that held back the groundwater from thousands of miles of tunnels beneath the city were turned off.  The pit filled with 30 billion gallons of water, and as mine tailings and mineral refuse contaminated the water, it became a giant insanely toxic lake of sulfuric acid.  A monument to greed and heedless exploitation of the earth and something eerily, yet tragically beautiful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you\\'re still living here, you have to have some kind of weird, perverse pride in the pit?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Correct me if I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You nailed it.  Obviously, the pit is an enduring emblem of that rapacious capitalist greed but you also have people near who are proud of where they live.  The history of Butte, in many ways, is you know, this town that should have died, but never did. Part of that is luck, geographically, but also the character of the people here.  You know, they endured.\\n\\n[21:19:14] BOURDAIN:  As you might have gathered by now, this is a working-class town and unusual in that it\\'s a union town.  A proudly union town in an otherwise very red state.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Butte is the most interesting, important town in America that nobody knows about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bryant McGregor is the owner of the silver dollar saloon in what was once Butte\\'s Chinatown.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Can we call ourselves Butte America?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Amanda Curtis, a former state congresswoman was born of the labor movement.  She\\'s a unionist and an advocate for workers and this solidly Union City she calls home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you got off the boat at Ellis Island it said Butte pinned to your shirt and it wasn\\'t Butte, Montana, right? It was Butte, America.  We were founded by European immigrants who came from socialist countries with all of these crazy socialist ideas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Would you say Montana in a stereotypical way fairly relatively socially conservative?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, absolutely, but Butte is a labor town.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nobody knows anything about union history.  And now, they don\\'t teach it.  When the country was at its peak, unions were at their peak.  Wages were at their peak, unions were at their peak.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That was then, this is now.  This is the era of I\\'ve got mine, Jack.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what makes Butte different.  It\\'s not I\\'ve got mine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It isn\\'t?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We\\'ve grown community out of taking care of each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You have to remember what it was like for workers before unions, if you can imagine.  Men worked under ground for as little as $3 a day, 10 to 12-hour shifts, six days a week.  Thousands died over the years in industrial accidents or from silicosis, lungs ravaged by the airborne silica dust.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You don\\'t have any rights in your workplace unless you bond together and have a collective voice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In a one-company town despite hiring assassins and strike- breakers, Buttes thousands of workers successfully managed to unionize.  Labor costs increased while copper prices slammed. Anaconda responded by moving their production increasingly south.  Way south.  To Chile with such impediment as labor laws and fair wages were more malleable.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We serve as the example about what happens if you allow unfettered capitalism.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But isn\\'t there something beautiful about unfettered capitalism?  Because look, this structure here --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, yes, we powered the entire world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As somebody making their money in the God damn United States of America first.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I feel I\\'m a patriot and you\\'re taking jobs away from America to export them overseas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You\\'re not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re not.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And we\\'ve been talking about this for decades in this country right?  Keep our jobs here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes!\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:25:55] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Time sinks slowly to the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench.  She\\'s tired of light and it\\'s feared Black.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They say that Butte is a mile high and a mile deep and to get an idea of what they mean you\\'ve got to go down.  Down deep into the hill.  An intricate warren of tunnels riddled through the rock and soil that lay beneath the city was flooded forever by water and darkness.  The orphan boy mine is one of the few remaining hard rock mines in the city.\\n\\nToday it serves as a training facility for the Montana tech school of mines and engineering.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are five generations of mining here.  In order to survive and provide the resources for America, these people were super skillful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jim Keane is a state senator and labor advocate who grew up working the mines of Butte.\\n\\nHow many miles of tunnel under Butte total?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ten thousand miles of tunnel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ten thousand miles.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I figured --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re smaller, usually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Larry Hoffman is a longtime mining engineer and instructor. Matt Krattinger is a new guy.  A hard rock miner by day, he likes to relax by spending his free time down here playing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I come mining for fun on my days off.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It gets in your blood and you get a lot of pride in it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These guys like it underground, and even more, they seem to like drilling holes deep into the rock face.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to drill?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pull that out.  And then you get the feel for where the weight sets on it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You do that several hundred times a day, though. It\\'s good!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sweet!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The community recognized the miner was at the top of the food chain.  When I grew up he was considered just like a doctor or a lawyer because everybody knew he was the one making everything work.  The other thing about mining is that it\\'s so intensive.  I mean, you need engineers.  You need guys running ventilation, mechanic or carpenter or a pipe fitter.  It\\'s just such a diverse asset to have all these different types of people.  That\\'s what was so good about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mining was always dangerous, but these men are proud of what they do and of the generations who came before them, who built neighborhoods and schools and helped power the nation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They loved their work.  They raised their families.  They worked all the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was a destination with hopes and dreams of hard work leading to a better life.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, the company is a son of a bitch, let\\'s face it, but they were our son of a bitch.  So, you know, that\\'s just the way it was.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The community worked to support the people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here\\'s the fun part!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cool!\\n\\nHow many holes do you usually drill to make a round?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Between 20 and 30.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is a round?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This pattern has to be drilled out and every time you advance the face that is a round.  You drill it, you load it.  You blast it, you muck it, you bolt it and you drill it again and that\\'s a cycle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re in the loading process right here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s all prime and top priming in this hole. Quick, fill it away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Back in the day it was dynamite, but in the -- they started switching over to this stuff.  Anfo, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We got everything in charge and uploaded.  Now we get to time it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is kind of where I got hooked on mining.\\n\\n[21:30:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I set that first round off.  This is kind of where I got hooked on mining.  And I set that first round off.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do we do another one?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s fascinating. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is where it all starts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody got everything out?  Four seconds of silence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right, everybody\\'s good?  Everybody\\'s ready?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  Fire on the hole.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One, two, three.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to mining.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s deeply satisfying.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh yeah.  Very cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can we see the smoke?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Through that vent, get out?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  The smoke will start moving towards us.  We got to get in the smoke.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh yeah.  Smells like victory.  This is the smell of mining.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'ll see if it all worked at last.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That shock wave is awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Isn\\'t it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is like being an astronaut right now.  When we go in there you can be the first person in the world to see what you\\'re seeing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you break it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nice.  Well, happy that it worked.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m very happy with it.  It really came out just the way it should.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well that\\'s another six-foot advance.  And that is around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I fell in love with the dark and the blowing things up and the people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The people is a big thing.  You meet some of the most interesting people.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:38] BOURDAIN:  About one third of Montana is public land.  It was set aside for the people of the United States of America.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, it is intended for multipurpose use.  Timber harvest, grazing land, hiking, fishing, hunting and mining.  These open lands are important to hunters and anglers like Dan Bailey.  He\\'s the Montana representative for Pheasants Forever.  An organization working to conserve pheasants and other wild life in careful management.\\n\\nDAN BAILEY, PHEASANTS FOREVER REPRESENTATIVE:  So this is a piece of property that\\'s owned by Pheasants Forever.  It\\'s open to public access.  This is through Montana\\'s block management system.  We signed in, they collect all of the tags.  They know who\\'s on the property.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Today, me and my friend Joe Rogan are going after some delicious pheasant for dinner.\\n\\nJOE ROGAN, PODCASTER AND SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Yee-haw, ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Joe is of course the voice of the UFC and the host of the widely popular podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience\".\\n\\nIn recent years, Joe has become an advocate from the notion that you should, whenever possible, know where your food comes from.\\n\\nROGAN:  The connection that you have with your food when you kill it yourself, you know, it\\'s just -- it\\'s a totally different experience.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I believe that if you choose to eat meat that you -- there should be a little bit of guilt and shame involved.  Something did die.  So there should be a sense of loss and then understanding.\\n\\nBAILEY:  Right here, this is it.  I mean you know where your food comes from.  That\\'s as small circle as you can get.\\n\\nIt\\'s only the three things we can hunt here, a Hungarian Partridge which is a small bird and the big kind of sharp-tailed grouse and then rooster pheasants.  So no hen pheasants so I\\'ll call out what it is. BOURDAIN:  Yeah.  I\\'m going to wait for you because I\\'m sure that would be what I identify.\\n\\nBAILEY:  It\\'s only one person on one side of Joe.  I need one person on the other and I\\'ll run the dogs in the middle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which way they\\'re going to break, do you think, they could get?\\n\\nBAILEY:  In any which way.  We\\'re hoping over us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hen, hen, hen, hen, hen, hen, hen.\\n\\nROGAN:  What happens if you accidentally shoot the hen?  Do you get in trouble?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Work still, you\\'ve heard about the walk of shame?  So you really, you have a split second to determine whether it\\'s a shootable bird, I think.\\n\\nROGAN:  Okay.  Well, we\\'ll count on you.\\n\\nBAILEY:  That\\'s a rooster.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I could have shot at that too.  That was an easy shot, shit.\\n\\nROGAN:  From those, yeah one of those days, huh.\\n\\nBAILEY:  Public land in Montana, we\\'re fortunate we have a lot of them.  But, you know, they get a lot of pressure and so when you get one of these birds it\\'s pretty special.\\n\\nROGAN:  Public hunting is always, always a lot of work.\\n\\nBAILEY:  In general, anybody and everybody can come out here and chase your birds so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I can see a bunch of birds out there.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nROGAN:  I saw a bunch of pheasants scattered.  Let\\'s get serious about this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nBAILEY:  We\\'ll take these dogs to the river.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Rooster.\\n\\nROGAN:  Oh nice shot.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Going to get up on that bank. ROGAN:  Who got it?\\n\\nBAILEY:  Anthony caught it.\\n\\nROGAN:  Nice.\\n\\nBAILEY:  I missed that one over here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good boy.  Come (inaudible), come on.  Good boy.  Come on jugger.\\n\\nROGAN:  Nice shot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bring here.  Bring it here.

       " '\\n[21:00:00] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN  HOST: People, who come here, stopping in Naxos, are they island hopping, or are they coming in this -- this the destination?\\n\\nLAMBROS, BAR OWNER AND GUIDE: Well, I mean, island hopping happens a lot during the summer. So, you know, as someone who\\'s arranged to have like a two-, three-week vacation in Greece will probably want to visit like at least two or three islands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So how many islands in this island group?\\n\\nLAMBROS: The Cyclades?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Cyclades.\\n\\nLAMBROS: It\\'s about 15, maybe more. There\\'s Andros, Tinos, Mykonos, Syros, Paros, Naxos...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And too -- and Jermaine.\\n\\nLAMBROS: That\\'s it, and more.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right, and the rest.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And the rest, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A lot of history here in the Greek islands. On Naxos in particular, where Zeus himself was said to live. Where his son Dionysus frolicked and presumably drank and threw orgies and dropped E, and danced all night to the B.C. version of EDM.\\n\\nThese days you have to go over to Mykonos for that. Anyway, Lambros here runs a bar in Athens, but comes out here frequently to get away from it all.\\n\\nLAMBROS: If you were a Greek, you would definitely dig boarding a boat and leaving for the Cyclades. You know, there\\'s this air of mysticism about them, like an arcane feeling, that definitely doesn\\'t exist in the other islands, the archipelagos in Greece.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A big glass of Raki on the rocks.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And a big glass of regular...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh jeez, that\\'s a - it\\'s a little more than I would sort of -- well, I\\'ll have a sip.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yamas. Good morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yamas.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, it kind of puts the day into perspective when you start off with a -- with a drink.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah. Wow, it\\'s a perfect day for the beach.\\n\\nLAMBROS: It\\'s a perfect day, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I like the wind here, and actually it\\'s one of the really cool things about this island is it\\'s that breeze, you know, that always.\\n\\nLAMBROS: It\\'s like our main past-time, talking about the wind. Wind\\'s coming, the wind\\'s leaving, which beach do you go to when the wind is coming from the north.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really?\\n\\nLAMBROS: The south. Yes, most islands want to claim that actually like Odysseus, Ulysses was from there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Or homer was from there. It\\'s -- everyone wants to claim, you know, a bit of fame from the mythology to their islands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I can tell you this, Ulysses was kind of a dick. He left his wife alone for how long? And how far was he from home? He wasn\\'t that far.\\n\\nLAMBROS: he wasn\\'t that far.\\n\\n[21:05:00] BOURDAIN: I mean, he was just dicking around in the islands, you know. He couldn\\'t go home and, you know, throw the wife a quick one, you know, before -- and then he gets pissed because she\\'s got to look elsewhere?\\n\\nLAMBROS: He came up with this unbelievable story.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, but baby -- I don\\'t know...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: He went back home, and he said, \"Darling, you won\\'t believe what happened to me.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN: There were these chicks. They were singing. They, they lured the ship into the rocks, and they weren\\'t hot, though. They were really ugly.\\n\\nLAMBROS: I think you summed him up perfectly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: there you go, the Iliad. I see a lot of empty villas, like a lot of half-finished construction.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yeah, they all stopped like a few years ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Money just ran out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. No, I don\\'t want to talk about the financial crisis. It\\'s bumming me out. It\\'s harsh in my total buzz. The pressures of the outside world, I don\\'t want to think about.\\n\\nI\\'m on a Greek island here. It\\'s a beautiful day. I\\'m planning on passing out on the beach shortly. You know, maybe some watercolors, do a little cooking, more napping, eating, napping. Contemplate mysteries of the universe or nap, either one.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Or nap, either...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Or eat cheese. All of those are honorable options. I mean, that\\'s a vacation to me, is staying put and doing nothing. I wanted to get away from it all. Coast gently, gently into another season of television. No sharp edges, easy. Late summer of 2015 in the Cyclades and it feels a million miles from the Greece you see in the headlines.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Greek banks have remained closed for the entire week. Now the depth of their financial woes is becoming painfully clear.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Athens has asked its people whether they accept stringent reforms as part of the country\\'s second bailout.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: 40,000 Greeks have hit the streets.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The country could find itself kicked out of the euro. Athens could just be roads away from finical disaster.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That Greece they say, is teetering on the edge of economic apocalypse, broke, in peril of being foreclosed on by the disdainful European powers. On top of that, there\\'s a refugee crisis.\\n\\nGreece, probably the least prepared, least equipped to take in thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, is being flooded with desperate women, children, men. They wash up on their shores alive and dead.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s not just a question of Greece now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And yet here, on Naxos, one of thousands of Greek islands, you could for now if you chose to, remain blissfully ignorant of what\\'s happening elsewhere. Pretend that everywhere is just like here, beautiful, sleepy, delicious food, everything is just fine.\\n\\nJohn Steinbeck said any man who pits his intelligence against a fish and loses has it coming. But the Greek fishing trade didn\\'t stand a chance when hit with the one-two punch. First, of diminishing fish stocks, then the financial crisis and slacking demand. Is life good on Naxos compared to the mainland?\\n\\nGEORGE, FISHERMAN: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really?\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yeah, I mean well, if you come from this island with the fresh air and the sea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really? This gentleman is a fisherman.\\n\\nLAMBROS: George is a fisherman. His name is fearless George.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Fearless George.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So, as I understand it, in many, if not all of the Greek Islands, the government or the E.U. is offering buyouts to fisherman? They\\'re basically saying, \"We\\'ll pay you to not fish.\"\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: They\\'re trying to get the older, domestic fishermen out of the way, basically in order to...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The little guys.\\n\\n[21:10:00] LAMBROS: Yes, the little guys in order to get more commercial fishing being imported into the land. Quite a few have sold out their businesses, their boats and moved in to like tourism.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Up here? I mean, as far as the -- the economic crisis, I mean, you\\'ve got the whole E.U. crunching down on poor Greece. Greeks are being depicted as basically lazy, addicted to social welfare. What happened?\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: I\\'m pretty sure he means the politicians.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: And the people -- and the people are paying for the complete wrongdoings of the politicians.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: So yes, it\\'s a shame really. Anyway, we had a good spell living on other people\\'s money for about 40 years was -- was good fun.\\n\\n[21:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nPANOS, DIVE MASTER AND GUIDE: The wreck was a cargo ship, and crashed on the reef in 1982, so it\\'s 34 years inside of the water.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Diving in the Cyclades is some of the best in the med and I was told this wreck was filled with stolen doubloons and Nazi morphine. Panos, my dive master, has certainly never heard these rumors. No treasure down there, nothing sinister or...\\n\\nPANOS: maybe there is inside, in the engine room. I never get there so I don\\'t know what is inside. The rumor is that they crashed it on purpose in order to take the insurance and so nobody was injured. Everybody was safely transferred to the Port of Ayama (ph). That\\'s a rumor, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How many times have you been down to that wreck?\\n\\nPANOS: Hundreds of times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hundreds of times?\\n\\nPANOS: Hundreds of times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And it never gets old? You still have fun?\\n\\nPANOS: Yes. Every time is special.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The Greek islands when compared to the rest of the country are doing pretty well. Tourism on Naxos, in fact, is on an uptick. I don\\'t know what your family told you when he said, \"You know, I\\'m going to go to Naxos and I\\'m going to run a dive center.\"\\n\\nI know my parents would\\'ve said, \"You should do something sensible with a future, like banking.\" As it turns out, this was a sensible career choice, I guess. So cheers to that.\\n\\nPANOS: Yes, yamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Around 25 percent of the nation is unemployed now. They say that about 40 percent are living close to the poverty line. That\\'s apparently the mainland? And yet tourism is stable and maybe even growing.\\n\\nPANOS: Well, it is, it is getting bigger even though it is completely opposite with a crisis.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So people are basically saying, \"Oh, financial crisis, beautiful islands, beautiful country.\"\\n\\nPANOS: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: \"Now is the time to go because we can get it for cheap.\"\\n\\nPANOS: Tourism is the only thing I believe that saved Greece. Apart from this area, every other thing collapsed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It\\'s really beautiful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\n[21:20:00] BOURDAIN: Medea, Antigone, Helen of Troy after deity Demeter. Greek women have always been known for their beauty, their fierceness, their strength, their willingness to fight for what they believe in.\\n\\nAnd these ladies who call themselves the stray bitches, these women are very much part of that tradition. When I mentioned that I was drinking Ouzo before, I kind of...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a reaction.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: There was a reaction.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We prefer Raki.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Okay, so I will be drinking Raki on the rocks.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bravo. Yamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The stray bitches. Who are the stray bitches?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What are they?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It\\'s a theatrical musical group, with political -- whoa -- with political issues. And it speaks a lot about what we live today in Greece in Athens.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I\\'ve seen you described as anarchists.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ah, no, I don\\'t like stereotypes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don\\'t like characteristics. Yes, of course, I like very much the anarchy philosophy of course. It speaks about solidarity and the common good because all life in Greece now is very hard.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: During the \\'90s, it was all this wealth and prosperity and we were all okay with this. But now it\\'s time to talk about politics and make political statements.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A lot of the world, Greece is being depicted as Greeks got used to not having to pay taxes. The stereotype is...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a great - look...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is it true or not?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But that\\'s a very nice strategy to create a stereotype of the people you want to exploit. And say they are lazy, they\\'re terrible, AIDS propaganda, we can let them...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: From the moment we build our state, we build it on loans. The great powers, England, France, Russia, helped us to build our state so we owe from this moment. The truth is that never this nation took care of the citizens. They didn\\'t give back anything, nothing, to the people, so why to pay your taxes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It\\'s distrust.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A basic distrust is that people are going to spend the money well?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It\\'s not like -- it\\'s not like a mentality thing that comes from our genes, from our cells. We are not like the lazy people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So what happens? Should Greece be in the E.U.?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here for the people in Greece, it is a feeling that \"Oh, if we go out of the European Union, we are lost.\" We are as people may be ready to risk to go in another direction because this direction doesn\\'t work for us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Nobody\\'s suggesting we return to an agrarian wonderland where we are all going to farm together and live in a commune, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why not?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You like this idea?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, why not?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some of us will, some of us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: If I put a yogurt in the refrigerator, and I put my name on it, \"Tony,\" and someone takes a bite out of it, I\\'ve got a problem.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes. This is why I don\\'t live in a commune.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because someone will be taking my yogurt?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, but if you didn\\'t have a yogurt, you would like to eat from someone else\\'s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And I will.\\n\\n[21:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hey, man, how are you doing?\\n\\nLABROS: Hi, tony, how are you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, an idyllic mountain village, Apiranthos. The sort of place where you can still walk in to a town square and find yourself caught up in a celebration.\\n\\nThis one celebrates Greco-American actor John Stamos\\'s return to \"Full House.\" Then get ready for wine, Raki and being hand-fed by strangers.\\n\\nLABROS: I think there was sending off of a villager to go to the army, basically a good reason for everyone to, you know, let -- let some steam out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Whoa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, yes, yes. (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\n[21:30:00] BOURDAIN: Lamb, pig?\\n\\nLAMBROS: This is lamb, this is pork, and this is pork.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And the famous potatoes, of course.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And the famous potatoes. This is called the Rosto, which is a traditional Naxos style of pork.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Whoa, good sauce. It\\'s like tomato and peppers or...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: Prasi (ph), yes, wine -- wine, tomato sauce, pepper and garlic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK), yamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yamas.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yamas. (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nSTEFANOS, WINE MAKER: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So you make wine?\\n\\nSTEFANOS: I make wine, yes. I make good wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Born here?\\n\\nSTEFANOS: Well, not born here. I came from Naxos when I was 23 years old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: From?\\n\\nSTEFANOS: Athens. BOURDAIN: Athens, so very different life here?\\n\\nSTEFANOS: I believe here, you live every moment of your life. Yes, you feel really the freedom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, thank you. This village, what do people here do for a living, farm, tourism, both?\\n\\nLAMBROS: No, I guess a combination.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I noticed a lot of churches, little chapels.\\n\\nLAMBROS: There are shit loads, and it\\'s basically the continuation of the original temples, be the temples of Apollo or even Zeus or Athena or something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They switched over?\\n\\nLAMBROS: They switched over to churches.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hey, you guys thought pagan idolatry was fun? Check it out. It\\'s much more fun and we\\'ll slide right in there and you won\\'t even notice.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Seamlessly. Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Important island in mythology though.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Extremely.\\n\\nSTEFANOS: It is the old Dionysus Island here. Yes, it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: God of wine, women in song, basically.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And madness.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And madness? One of the things I like about Greek mythology is that the gods were all deeply flawed. I mean, they had some serious problems. They were always, you know, sleeping with humans. They were jealous. They get angry. They weren\\'t pure. They weren\\'t perfect. They weren\\'t divine. They were...\\n\\nSTEFANOS: They were humans.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, but every now and then, Dionysus would appear and like everyone would say -- and then let\\'s all have a great time. Why not?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIEID MALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\n[21:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I mean, you want this, right? Of course you do, but you can\\'t have it.\\n\\nYANNIS, FARM OWNER AND GUIDE: One pepper or two?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, one is good, one is good.\\n\\nYANNIS: And did you try a pepper? It\\'s different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right. It\\'s beautiful, thank you.\\n\\nMARIA, FARM OWNER AND YANNIS\\' WIFE: Ok, here we eat a lot, OK? You can eat as much as you like.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thank you. A family farm, this one dates back to the Venetians, mom, dad, daughter Maria, her husband Yannis, who happens to be the Aegean regional governor. Let the food begin -- stuffed pepper, the famous potatoes.\\n\\nYANNIS: Naxos potatoes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Coq au vin, a slow-cooked rooster?\\n\\nYANNIS: Rooster, rooster with red sauce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And a...\\n\\nYANNIS: Rabbit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Rabbit, oh yes.\\n\\nYANNIS: Yamas, welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So how does that mean the rest of the country is not doing so well, but apparently here is pretty good?\\n\\nMARIA: Yes.\\n\\n[21:40:00] BOURDAIN: What\\'s different about Naxos?\\n\\nYANNIS: It\\'s...\\n\\nMARIA: Self-sustained.\\n\\nYANNIS: Self-sustained. For example, in Naxos, you can find 140,000 goats and lambs, and also, half of the population cultivating the land, so they are farmers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So it\\'s not just a tourist economy. You produce stuff here. You grow things.\\n\\nYANNIS: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Let me ask a difficult question. I\\'m not going to ask you this question because you have to be diplomatic about difficult questions like this. I\\'m going to guess your father doesn\\'t. So who caused the Greek financial crisis? What happened here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nMARIA: He\\'s not optimistic. He says we have a -- (SPEAKING IN GREEK)...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nMARIA: We need years. (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What does it mean to be Greek? What are the characteristics that all Greeks either do or should aspire to?\\n\\nMARIA: She says, above all, the family. (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nYANNIS: This means Greek. Greek remains here.\\n\\nMARIA: We are bound to the land, the land of our ancestors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The farm itself, how long has it been in the family?\\n\\nMARIA: This was bought by other grandfather of my father in 1901.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nMARIA: For us in the family, it\\'s a very special place, and especially for me and I believe for my father. It has a special vibe. There\\'s a good energy, this land.\\n\\n[21:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Please translate -- so I went to the beach today. I\\'m lying there having a good time, suddenly like 200 nudists show up. Late afternoon, I find myself on a fishing boat ruminating on matters of great importance.\\n\\nSo here\\'s my question. It\\'s a philosophical question. Greece is the home of philosophy, as we know it. Why are the first people to take off their clothes the last people you want to see naked?\\n\\nGEORGE, FISHERMAN: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, I totally agree with whatever he just said. Oh, yeah, here we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh yes, what do we got?\\n\\nGEORGE: Octopus salad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Lambros is there, and George of course, and George\\'s son, Niko.\\n\\nLAMBROS: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\n[21:50:00] GEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah, mashed fava beans. It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nLAMBROS: This is like as traditional as you get. All these dishes are either uses an appetizer before the main dish which is the soup or as breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Breakfast?\\n\\nLAMBROS: They have this for breakfast, maybe a couple of beers, and then they go to sleep again for a few hours.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Now you\\'re talking my language.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Beautiful. All the fish he catches, it\\'s sold on the island, or sent to Athens?\\n\\nLAMBROS: Mostly to Athens.\\n\\nGEORGE: Niko.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What kind of fish is this?\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: Olive oil and lemon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Man, this is some professional-quality stuff.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: You need to eat more.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah, the broth is fantastic.\\n\\nGEORGE: Yamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yamas, thank you.\\n\\nLAMBROS: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nNIKO, GEORGE\\'S SON: (SPEAKING IN GREEK) LAMBROS: He liked his dad doing it and he likes doing it himself. (SPEAKING IN GREEK).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I was going to ask.\\n\\nNIKO: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: Where there\\'s a will, there\\'s a way, he says. GEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: This is going to be just a great pleasure to tell -- he said when they were at the right age, something like 14, he took him to the brothels and took him to the whores and told them to realize they are all out to get your money.\\n\\nGet them a few drinks, have a good time, go completely nuts while you\\'re young, and everything so you\\'re going to be a bit laid back on the whole woman issue when the time comes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: When you\\'re 50?\\n\\nLAMBROS: Maybe, maybe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ok, OK, glad I asked. All right, not really.\\n\\nLAMBROS: So this is ouzo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, sweet. I\\'ll have some of that.\\n\\n[21:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: My rented villa is pleasant enough, but to be perfectly honest, lonely. Is it worse to be someplace awful when you\\'re by yourself or someplace really nice that you can\\'t share with anyone?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How are you doing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yamas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And it is very typical Greek sunset, the famous Greek sunset.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED: The grasses, the boat, wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Looks very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh man, that is really good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The good food makes you happy, very happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Opens your heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And there are a lot of countries where they\\'re really, really poor but they\\'re super serious about food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like where?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like here? Don\\'t go, don\\'t go very far. BOURDAIN: People who are not Greek, come to the Greek islands for the first time, come to Naxos, what should you do here? You should drink Raki for sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For sure, to eat...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get drunk with Raki also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Get drunk. It\\'s not enough to just drink it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, get drunk and sing and dance.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don\\'t tell me what you ate. Tell me who you ate with.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[22:00:00] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yamas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yamas.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:00:18] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN ANCHOR:  Somebody asks you where you\\'re from and you answer, \"I\\'m from Chicago,\" nobody\\'s going to give you a patronizing response like, \"oh, Chicago\\'s charming.\"\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, Chicago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More likely it\\'ll be \"Wow, Chicago\" or \"Oh, Chicago.\" they\\'ll be impressed.  Chicago is a town, a city that doesn\\'t ever have to measure itself against any other city.  Other places have to measure themselves against it.  It\\'s big, it\\'s outgoing, it\\'s tough, it\\'s opinionated and everybody\\'s got a story.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As late afternoon gives way to evening in Chicago\\'s old town, it\\'s time to drink.  So to be fair, almost anytime it\\'s time for a drink at the Old Town Ale House.\\n\\nThe chorus assembles to give their opinions on matters of the day subjects of great import to this city on the lake, this city of broad shoulders, this true metropolis.\\n\\nBRUCE CAMERON ELLIOTT, THE GERIATRIC GENIUS:  But there\\'s no shortage of characters in here.  You know, I\\'ve lost a couple of really great, it was John Fox the comic, died a few years ago.  We just lost Ruben Four Toes, this 400-pound Mexican guy.  We just called him Ruben and nobody will get his big toe cut off, and then he became Ruben nine- toes.  Then when he had his others big toe cut off, he became Ruben eight toes.  And then when he had his leg cut off, it changed down to Ruben Four Toes.\\n\\nHe blames all his problems on the fact his mother didn\\'t give him any titty milk.  I mean these guys, there\\'s nobody coming through the door to replace them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Old Town Ale House opened in 1958 and has been serving beer and other intoxicating beverages ever since.  Unless you\\'re on the no shot list, in which case your drinking options have been for the good of the community limited.  These are no shot list.\\n\\nELLIOTT:  There is, the only guy that ever got off, it is down there down now.  It was just because he was a pure and yeah, we have a fairly extensive no shot list.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very extensive, meaning you can drink hear but no shots for you.\\n\\nELLIOTT:  No shots.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Because just that will lead to no good?\\n\\nELLIOTT:  History has shown us that these people should naturally shots, well now of course what they do is they go to another bar and drink a shots and they come over and then we get the ruminants who would like.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bruce Cameron Elliott and his ex-wife are the proprietors of the Old Town Ale House.  Bruce likes to brag but he is never had an honest job.  But he\\'s a writer, legendary blogger and artist.\\n\\nSo who comes here, I mean generally that who your regulars?\\n\\nELLIOTT:  I think the most interesting thing about this bar on an average night, if you look down this bar at 10:00 or 11:00, I would say the average age is certainly over 40 which is very unusual.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s really what\\'s missing in my life.  I need an old man bar.  And is there a common thread to, be the -- your regulars?\\n\\nELLIOTT:  The common thread is -- of our hardcore regulars?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nELLIOTT:  They\\'re basically alcoholics.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean, I was dancing around that.\\n\\nELLIOTT:  Well, we don\\'t dance.  There are no dancing.  The late John Fox who was my all-time favorite funny man, he came up with Ale House hand shake.  The secret Ale House hand shake was like in the morning which was that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  What do you have to do to get barred here?\\n\\nELLIOTT:  You know, punch somebody probably more than one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More than once?\\n\\nThe walls of the bar are covered with his portraits of Ale House regulars which he mostly paints in the basement next to the beer cooler.\\n\\n[21:05:04] More notorious are his paintings of well-known political figures who have for one reason or another raised Bruce\\'s ire. They\\'re inevitably depicted in an unflattering let\\'s say non-family friendly light.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Putin has bad behaving very poorly, let me put it that way, I mean but he also intrigues me.  Plus, I also had the extra satisfaction knowing he would not like what I\\'m going to do.  And that\\'s, you know, that gives you a lot of pleasure. BOURDAIN:  There is no shortage of opinions at the Ale House Bar.  And Bruce\\'s opinions and the scope of his work extends far beyond Chicago\\'s borders.\\n\\nELLIOT:  I\\'m working on my latest painting, it\\'s Putin.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh yeah say no more, I want to see.\\n\\nELLIOT:  And I would like some advice because I was thinking of the classic Catherine the Great hoists, stallions, but then let me show you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s this ponies involved.  I love ponies.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Well, let me show you what I\\'ve come up with because simply because of the size constraints.  This is -- of course, that\\'s our beer cooler and everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is where the magic happens.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Well, this is where -- yeah, this is where Sarah Palin was painted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa.\\n\\nELLIOT:  And originally I was thinking and I\\'d be very interested in your input.  Originally what I thought was the Catherine the Great, the horses, and he in the receptive position.  But then on the other hand, when I put him in the two tube, I thought, I think that I\\'d really uncovered the true Putin there.  Ballets are very important in Russia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nELLIOT:  And if I painted him naked, that would almost be macho.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, you don\\'t need to -- I mean presumably tiny genitals.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Well, I don\\'t.  There\\'s any doubt about that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, look, he\\'s got his shirt off.  So already ...\\n\\nELLIOT:  That\\'s important part.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... he\\'s universally uninvolved because he really likes to take his shirt off.\\n\\nELLIOT: No, he does and I took his shirt off.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Loads (ph) I think this is an iconic image as is.\\n\\nELLIOT:  I really do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, I think it says it all.\\n\\nELLIOT:  I was glad -- I\\'m glad you told me that because I think I can go full steam ahead now.  I\\'m thinking pastel.  I\\'ve gotten pretty good with pastels.  But this might be one ...\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All fans of -- the people can follow your blog and know so much about, you know, I know who fixes your walk in refrigerator.  I know who fixes the bathroom, I know who comes in and cleans the floors.  And I know the entire morning routine between fancy the pants within the ...\\n\\nELLIOT:  Street Jimmy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... Jimmy and I know so much about all of these people and just the little, the day to day workings.  But do you think there\\'s something to be said like, you know, the trajectory of your client tell is not ...\\n\\nELLIOT:  Oh excuse me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... does not tend to be.\\n\\nELLIOT:  No, it\\'s not ascending.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s not ascending.\\n\\nELLIOT:  It\\'s not an ascendance, it\\'s in -- yes.  And I\\'ve lost a couple really.  I mean, we really lost some beauties.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean it\\'s the perils of being a saloon keeper, I mean ...\\n\\nELLIOT:  Here\\'s my take on that, bar people do not live as long as vegan joggers.  However, they have more fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In this city of factions, of neighborhoods, black, white, North Side, South, Cubs or White Sox, everybody at one point or another seems to agree on this place.  Valois in Hyde Park.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Got to grab your tray or you are rule here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think meatloaf and macaroni and cheese, please.\\n\\nELLIOT:  I think I\\'ll have the white fish, the mashed potatoes, and corn.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m very happy about that.  Two of my guilty pleasures on one plastic tray.\\n\\nWow, they sure gave us a lot of fish.\\n\\nSo what is -- where am I, what is this neighborhood?\\n\\nELLIOT:  This is Hyde Park.  This is the heart and soul of Hyde Park.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So if you\\'re running for office why would you use this place as your staging area?  What\\'s the social importance of it?\\n\\nELLIOT:  You will see every politician, black and white running for city office will come through here at some point.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?\\n\\nELLIOT:  It\\'s just kind of the -- well hangout.  You\\'d see Herald Washington here a lot.  I mean, Barack here.  I used to see Barack here all the time and yet spent most of a breakfast.\\n\\n[21:10:04] BOURDAIN:  The machine that is Chicago politics goes straight back to Emperor Richard Daley, the father then the son with a diverse cast of scound (ph) rules in between.\\n\\nHow are things in Chicago?  I mean on the oracle, the trajectory.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Oh there\\'s -- the problem was that we had this -- the daily dynasty.  We had the old man and when we had the kid, that\\'s a bright kid replaced him and he threw a party for his friends for over 20 years and when that came, he had the (inaudible) bill stuck out the back door of the city hall.  So it\\'s a mess right now financially.\\n\\nThe one thing about Chicago is you cannot get away with being a fake or a phony.  I mean, maybe somewhere out in one of the suburbs, but people see through it right away and that\\'s kind of Chicago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What other characteristics of a true Chicago would be stereotypically true?\\n\\nELLIOT:  I think you\\'ve got to make at least a little effort to be not be a pussy.  I think you\\'ve got to be a little tough.  I don\\'t think you can just ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Believe, you can\\'t be a pussy or at least you\\'re making an effort.\\n\\nELLIOT:  ... make a little effort, just not and just, you know, roll over and.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nMIERKA GIRTEN, THE ACTRESS:  I\\'m coming to the Ale House for over 20 years.  I have multiple sclerosis and I was leaving on rehearsal from a Red Orchid theater which is my theater company which is around the corner.\\n\\nAnd I came here, as really retired and I was talking to Mitt who\\'s Matt in the blog.  And maybe three or four other people at the end of the bar and I just remember like falling on the floor.\\n\\n[21:15:05] I heard somebody yell, \"She\\'s not breathing,\" and they called an ambulance.  And that\\'s kind of all that I remember.  And when I came back a few days later like I walked in the door, everybody was like \"Yeah, you\\'re better!\" and then couples of the regulars were like that guy, that guy said that thing.  And I was like what did he say?  And he said, when you were on the floor foaming at the mouth he said, they said they got really quiet and he said, \"I\\'ll have what she\\'s having.\"  So yeah, so that was fun.  But I found out later what was really interesting about is that right away my mind is ...\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nDANIEL STRAUSS, REPORTER:  The American cheeseburger, it\\'s the sort of feeling you get when you eat it.  But you remember you\\'re sitting with a friend and enjoying a memory that takes you back a long ago when you were young.  And as we follow Paul backstage watching him slowly sip his coffee.\\n\\nPAUL JUREWICZ, ACTOR:  Hey, what\\'s going on Daniel?\\n\\nSTRAUSS:  You remember that comedy isn\\'t just about laughs, it\\'s also about ...\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Coffee.\\n\\nSTRAUSS:  ... and clothes and being yourself.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Do you guys want to run this scene?\\n\\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Which one?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Transcendence.\\n\\nSTRAUSS:  And after all if we can\\'t laugh at ourselves, who can we laugh at?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  I got to be honest, he usually does it way better.\\n\\nSTRAUSS:  Oh come on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How is it that Chicago has become that sort of the font of comedy?  You know it\\'s, it\\'s a gusher.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  You know, fair with thing at city and then people came here to study.  I think 90 percent of the people who were doing comedy right now came to Chicago to study.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Paul Jurewicz, a young man at the beginning of what will presumably be a glorious career.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  First, he pushed me in the pool and that he called me ketchup dick.  I tried to be spontaneous one time and this is what I get.  I feel like no one respects me anymore.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Second city opened in Chicago\\'s old town in 1959 and almost from the beginning established the probably unhealthy symbiotic relationship with the Ale House.  You know their names, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Amy Poehler, Bill Murray, Chris Farley.\\n\\nIf you\\'re funny in America, chances are, you spent some formative years here getting the shit hammered out of you, learning one hopes in the parlance of the trade to kill.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  I tucked my undershirt into the underwear.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Don\\'t tell me, that\\'s you do with the show.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  For the show, probably seven times.  You got to be cannon boy, you know, not like a bowl of jell-o out there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know where are Second City people coming from?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  All over.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All over, right.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  All walks of life too.  I mean, it is the, you know, lawyers, teachers with, you know, servers.  It\\'s all classes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, at service, that\\'s a rich tradition.  I mean, one per -- any time you find anyone in the entertainment business, one presumes restaurant experience.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  I used to be a server.  I used to be a cook.  I was a sushi chef for a while.  I used to be a Segway tour guide.  I know so much ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You was a Segway tour guide?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  ... yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, you better have a sense of humor.\\n\\nPaul and I discuss the perilous nature of a life in comedy over some drinks and food at Longman & Eagle, where though the flannels and neck beards are abundant, the food is excellent.\\n\\nBeef tartare, I like that.  And who does not love roasted bone marrow. Tete de cochon with blue cheese and celery relish.  The good lord wants you to eat this.  Really, he speaks to me all the time.  Confit of beef tripe, crimsons are more about vegetables, slow roasted cauliflower with caramelized onions and lentils.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So does Second City travel, they have a road company?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  There are touring companies, three touring companies. They\\'re on cruise ships as well, so I did 10 months on a cruise ship.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Which is 10 months of looking at the water and wondering, you know, at this trajectory would the boat pull me under?  If I\\'ve had this much to drink, how long before the boat is out of my sight line?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So that\\'s like a prison ship, I mean because you can\\'t -- I mean is you care like about this.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  It\\'s real fun for the first two months.  You know, it\\'s a lot of fun hanging out with the crews.  You know, there\\'s a lot of, you know, venereal diseases going around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  And a lot of partying, and there\\'s a bar every two feet. And then after you hit the two months and you\\'re like, \"I want to go home.  Mom, please help me.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Talk about you know battlefield conditions to hone your craft, man.  I respect, that is -- because Jurewicz, that\\'s the idea behind it?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  The thing that you\\'ve said for me?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re going to send you out, you\\'re -- we can get back from the gulag, you will be stronger for it.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Oh absolutely.  It\\'s your first time getting paid as a performer and it\\'s also the largest amount of people I\\'ve ever performed for was on a cruise ship.  It was 950 people you\\'re performing to, you know, four nights a week.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Places, like one.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How are things?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Oh, good.  Can I put the game on?  The patriots are playing the Red Skins.\\n\\n[21:20:07] Do we know where the dry cleaning is?  There\\'s no job that you can like into this job.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What are you trying to say like there were some sort of time travelers?\\n\\n0:05:\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  My hemp business is doing really well.\\n\\nI think it\\'s all, I only have like four lines, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it a kind of supportive?  I mean, comedians are not famous for.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Stand ups, specifically, it\\'s more cut throat.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t we all just calm down here, all right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought I would get a pop or at least a reaction.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s too long.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Really, they were my socks are?  In the improve community I think it\\'s a lot more supportive because it\\'s a group sport.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you say community? JUREWICZ:  Yes.  Got your back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s right.  Got your back.  Got your back.\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  I got your back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I got your back.  I got your back.\\n\\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Got your back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what if someone sucks?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Improvise.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What if they\\'re just they suck?\\n\\nJUREWICZ:  Your job as an improviser is to make that person look amazing.  That\\'s how you know if you\\'re a good improviser.  This is the path of least resistance for me.  It was something I fell into that I loved, that I just found out that I was relatively good at and through a series of mishaps, I found myself for this position.\\n\\nLike you\\'d ask me six years ago, if I would be at the main stage of Second City, there\\'s no way.  I would\\'ve laughed at you.  So if this is where it ends for me, I\\'d be happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Maybe the first thing you think of when you think about Chicago is not ass burning Szechuan food, but maybe, maybe it should be.\\n\\nSTEPHANIE IZARD, CHEF, RESTAURATEUR:  What I think a lot of people come and they think that Chicago is like on the magnificent mile and, you know, they\\'re like,\" Oh then should we go down to navy pier?\"  I\\'m like, \"no.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nIZARD:  Why?  So it\\'s nice to go out to the neighborhoods and there\\'s so many ethnicities everywhere so going places like that is really awesome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One of my favorite Chicagoans, chef, restaurateur Stephanie Izard from the girl and negotiates and her colleague Peter Wong enlighten me.  Look, I knew Chicago was a city of very diverse neighborhoods.  Everybody says so, but this I didn\\'t know about, now I do.\\n\\nSo where are we and why are we here?  And real focusing, I\\'m really glad we\\'re here.  But why?\\n\\nIZARD:  We\\'re at Szechuan cuisine.  So after going into China, we were just talking about the Chengdu is my favorite place, but Peter\\'s actually never been to Chengdu.  And so, coming back and it was like, \"Let\\'s go to Chinatown and try to find places to find those things we ate for breakfast every day.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pork dumplings in chili oil start the fire.  Oh man, they\\'re slippery.\\n\\nIZARD:  I mean you got it.\\n\\nPETER WONG, COLLEAGUE OF STEPHANIE IZARD:  You know why the chopstick is thin?  It\\'s not thick and fat wood, you can just, you know, just do this.\\n\\nIZARD:  I thought you\\'re not supposed to do that? Peter, you\\'re supposed to help me knowing what\\'s faux pas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, so happy.\\n\\nOne of my favorite dishes in the world, anywhere, mapo doufu.  Yes, a tofu dish, stippled heavily with pork and a burny numbing nine and a half week style exercise in sadomasochism.  That will start you thinking some deeply disturbing thoughts.  Do you know mapo doufu, is it because it looks like spotted grandmother or did spotted pot marked grandmother create the dish?  You know both?  Yes, right?\\n\\nIZARD:  My mouth is a little on fire right now.  I think the rice came at the right time.\\n\\nWONG:  Yes.  Sounds like we are suffering, but actually it\\'s delicious.  Yeah, Anthony, try some of this, this is my favorite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This specialty of the house, fish hot pot.\\n\\nIZARD:  Nice.  All right, here it goes.  I scooped out some innards.\\n\\n[CROSSTALK]\\n\\nWONG:  You\\'re going for the best piece?\\n\\nIZARD:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh it burns so good.  I can pretty much eat this every day.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBILL CURRIE, AKA HAWKEYE:  The summation was that I moved to move him away from another customer, and he back-up and clenched his fist, and boy, when somebody clenches their fists, you know, they\\'re really capable of doing something.  So I got in the first shot and then somebody grabbed me by my arms and held my arms and he got the second shot off.  And he re-deviated my septum, which was a good thing, but, you know, he was bleeding and I was bleeding, and you know, it was camaraderie.  We all -- we hugged and kissed afterwards and, \"Bill, Oh I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry I did that thing.\"  Well, he\\'s dead now and I don\\'t want to speak poorly about the dead.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nLUPE FIASCO, HIP-HOP ARTIST:  We always lived in the hood. You would hear gunshots in the distance.  You would get to know about gangs. You will see the graffiti.  The people who you were growing up with, playing with, wouldn\\'t be there anymore. It\\'s like, \"Oh, what happened to such and such?\"  And it\\'s like, \"Oh, he\\'s dead.  He was in a gang.  He got killed in a drive by or he got shot in the South of Central.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hip-hop artist extraordinaire, Lupe Fiasco grew up on the South and West sides of Chicago.  But inside, his home was always an island of sanity, to supportive, creative environment.\\n\\n[21:30:04] What was different about your family?\\n\\nFIASCO: My mother and my father were very intelligent, and politically oriented, and active.  So, you know, I got book smart and street smart, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Floyd Webb is an old family friend.  This is Lupe\\'s mom, Shirley.  As becomes quickly apparent, she is along with being an extraordinarily good cook and extraordinary and determined human being.\\n\\nMan, this is so outrageously, delicious, wow.  The whole time we\\'re eating by the way people are moving in and out of Shirley\\'s small apartment.  The place clearly a hub for a tightly knit community of friends and family.\\n\\nSo what age were you when you came to Chicago?\\n\\nSHIRLEY FIASCO, LUPE\\'S MOTHER:  I was 13.  The worst thing that my family could ever done was left the south, was left Mississippi.  I should have stayed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But this was the land of opportunity here in Detroit, and great cities in the north.\\n\\nS. FIASCO:  It was and we came out, you know, and then we were never hungry down in Mississippi.  We got here depending on welfare whatever.  And they became alcoholics, abusive to the children and wives.  And the children came out in the streets and just everybody lost control and now it\\'s (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was Chicago like when you arrived?\\n\\nS.FIASCO:  Uh, it wasn\\'t as violent.  You know, the neighborhoods were communities.  No vacant lots or families, all over kids in the street. You could go outside and play and not worry about your children.\\n\\nAnd somewhere in the late \\'70s or early \\'80s it started to change and become more violent.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On July 4th, two young men gunned down.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The more than 50 percent surge in homicides.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nine people shot to death and at least 60 others wounded.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  However much you might love Chicago, want to celebrate its general awesomeness, its character, its architecture, its food. There\\'s no getting away from the ugly fact that Chicago\\'s south side is also currently the murder capital of America.\\n\\nWhy do you think people are killing each other in such large numbers in Chicago and not in New York?\\n\\nFLOYD WEBB, FILM PRODUCER:  Let\\'s be clear, it\\'s only a few spots, it isn\\'t the whole city.  It\\'s not the whole city.\\n\\nL. FIASCO:  To be honest, Chi-Raq is Englewood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, you know, it\\'s a pretty staggering body count.\\n\\nL. FIASCO:  The sad part is that it\\'s been like this, right.  And the only reason the story now is that white people looking at it.  And it\\'s like oh, that\\'s terrible, that\\'s been like this for 30 years. How come it wasn\\'t terrible 30 years ago when you probably could actually could did something about it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Does a hip-hop artist have any obligation really to speak about anything positive or even smarter than cars, girls or where\\'s my money?\\n\\nL. FIASCO:  I guess it depends on where you come from.  And then do you feel the obligation to where you came from.  A lot of people in the hood won\\'t take me serious.\\n\\nThey won\\'t take Chuck D serious, because at least you take some money who\\'s rapping about crack, and rapping about dope, that is the actual thing that they can go get and sell and make money that day if they wanted to.\\n\\nYou can\\'t preach them Black Panther party or, you know, Marcus Garvey it is because they can\\'t go out and get it and actually sell it and monetize and make some money out of it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nDespite an appalling murder rate, questionable leadership, Chicagoans aren\\'t going anywhere any time soon.\\n\\nS. FIASCO:  The southern people we brought our spirit here, so Chicago have like a warm spirit and, you know, loving spirit.\\n\\nL. FIASCO:  It\\'s a beautiful place, it\\'s a genuinely beautiful place where you have to redefine what beauty is to you.  When you go to different neighborhoods, and it\\'s really bad.\\n\\nBut even in that, there\\'s still a beauty in the people and then just from a cultural front, you know, we got everything here, you know.  We got -- you want capoeira, we got capoeira.\\n\\nWEBB:  And what all the guys here, we got over the guys there.\\n\\nL. FIASCO:  Yeah, if you want house music, we got that too.  You want a straight finance and you want just be a stock market baron, we got that too, you know.  You want some of the best food that you ever find, we got that too.\\n\\nSo, we\\'re at crossroads, and we picked up a lot of little DNA in things from different places on all friends.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nBRUCE CAMERON ELLIOTT, THE GERIATRIC GENIUS:  I\\'ve learned it.  I\\'ve all risks my whole life I\\'ve learned a lot of difficulty with these fire plug type guys.  And he started looking like he was going to start punching Street Jimmy who\\'s a guy that hangs around on the street and comes in here and I said something to him.  He came -- he made a move, so I cut him a real nice left knocked him down.\\n\\nAnd I never saw a guy make this move before.  But on his stomach he just went -- I\\'d squished over hooked my leg, got on top of me and started whacking me.  And Hawkeye, our doorman, just sat there watching me being pummeled.  And Street Jimmy came over and grabbed his arm, I got off.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nSTEVE ALBINI, BIG BLACK FOUNDER:  Making a living hasn\\'t really been what it\\'s been about ever in Chicago.  Keeping the ball in the air is what it\\'s about.  Just making sure that things keep going, remain viable and sustainable.\\n\\nNobody is too concerned about making a killing or becoming a star. Everybody just wants to keep doing it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that a uniquely Chicago attitude?\\n\\nALBINI:  I flatter myself by thinking that people in Chicago care more about what they\\'re doing than what they\\'re getting paid to do it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One of the things people have always loved about Chicago of course is the music.  And if one guy who\\'s defined rock and roll and punk sounds for the last three decades.  Well this guy, Steve Albini, would have to be a powerful candidate.\\n\\nMember of the legendary Chicago punk band Big Black and one of the most important producers of underground rock.  Albini produced some of the most influential music of the last 25 years.  The Pixies, Slint, Nirvana, P.J. Harvey, to name a few.\\n\\n[21:40:15] He takes me to one of his favorite Chicago spots Ricobene\\'s, the sample the particularly unholy delights of the breaded fried steak sandwich.\\n\\nThis things is ...\\n\\nALBINI:  This is a half a sandwich bare in mind.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... that\\'s like four pounds.\\n\\nALBINI:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  We\\'re going to need a boat load of napkins.  There\\'s no delicate way to eat this, you just hoist and go.\\n\\nALBINI:  The time out of the fryer is also critical.  These are still crispy on the outside.  This is precisely the way this sandwich was meant to be eaten.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.  That is a thing of beauty and tasty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, you have remarkably unusual for the music industry, unremarkably lenient views on music sharing.  Your pricing structure as a producer is, you know, somewhat against the grain of the usual business model.\\n\\nAnd you were not living in L.A. or New York or living on a mountaintop, peeing on the, you know, peeing downwards from a great height.  What are you, some kind of a communist?  What\\'s ...\\n\\nALBINI:  Well, I mean, I have a healthy suspicion of capitalism as a method.  I feel like, you know, left unchecked.  Capitalism is kind of a cultural sociopathy like if for a business to be successful in capitalist terms, it has to do the best possible job of exploiting everyone that it\\'s -- that it does interaction with.\\n\\nThe endgame of capitalism is that everything is crappier and crappier and people are more and more exploited, and I have a healthy suspicion of that.  So, I feel like that social model that I\\'m comfortable with, it suits my business practices, which is that we\\'re all in the same game.  We\\'re all trying to do the same thing.  We just want to make sure that things get better for everybody.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that a Chicago attitude, you think?\\n\\nALBINI:  Well, in my circles it is.  Yeah, in the punk rock scene and the people who are influenced by the punk rock scene.  And that\\'s, that\\'s a very common notion is that you\\'re not trying to extract the maximum, you\\'re trying to make sure that everything goes -- everything carries on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there less douchery in Chicago?\\n\\nALBINI:  You can find jag-offs.  That\\'s a uniquely Chicago ....\\n\\n[CROSSTALK]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, actually I really love it.  It\\'s been so long since I\\'ve heard it.\\n\\nALBINI:  Oh, if you look for them, you can find jag-offs of all type in Chicago.  But the people who are, you know ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you so much.\\n\\nALBINI:  ... you\\'re welcome.  Productive and content and part of an enterprise that is, you know, righteous, for lack of better terms. BOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nALBINI:  They tend to not just give lip service to the notion of egalitarianism or fairness, but they tend to embody it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about the musicians?  I mean, how much money does a guitar hero deserve to make?\\n\\nALBINI:  Well, all of it, obviously, because that\\'s what people are listening to.  People are listening to somebody\\'s creative expression.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Look down the bar, right and (inaudible).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some characters she can\\'t write about it.  I mean Some people would ...\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\n... look good?\\n\\nPATRICK HEYLIN,  AKA \"BUZZKILL\":  Around here nicknames is Caver (ph) a sick Caver (ph) I think.  They configure like whoa and you just -- you don\\'t just ask him, you just live with it.\\n\\nWhen I used to bartend the morning shift here, him and this other guy used to come in a bit crazy before it was even like 8:30 in the morning.  And this one poor guy was here, and they were like on both sides of him just going nuts, and I\\'m like, you know, that\\'s it.  You know, you guys got to go.\\n\\nBut he says, \"You know man, you\\'re a real Buzzkill\".  And it stuck to me ever since.  I mean it\\'s carved in stone pretty much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chicago is famously a sports town.  The Bulls, the Bears, the Cubs, the White Sox.  To you and me, those are just names, but to many Chicagoans, a cause, a defining lifestyle choice.\\n\\nThe rivalry between Cubs and White Sox fans, for instance, is particularly vicious.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Difference between a Cub fan and a Sox fan is, a Cub fan goes to the park, they enjoy themselves, they have fun.  The team wins, that\\'s OK, if they lose, it\\'s no big deal.  Sox\\'s fan will turn on their team on a dime, if they don\\'t -- if they\\'re not good, if they don\\'t play well.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  That is true.\\n\\nELLIOT:  And also -- but a perfect day for a Sox fan is the Sox to win, Cubs to lose, and then the Cubs\\' plane crashes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So to what do you attribute this quality of deep bordering on murderous hatred?\\n\\nHEYLIN:  The hatred is basically from the south side.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Of course it is.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  I mean, they hate us like we have no idea.  We don\\'t have that vicious intent to them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why -- where -- why the viciousness and hatred?\\n\\nELLIOT:  All right.  But to be around Cub fans is to hate them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So let\\'s go, cubbies.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cubs all the way.  Woo.  Yeah, baby.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  I just -- I can never bring myself to understand their hatred of us.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Go, Cubs, go.  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So they\\'re -- they\\'re first.  Their historic destiny is to be losers.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Yes.  And like they say, any team can have a bad century. The Cubs are working on having two bad centuries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n[21:50:07] Topo Gigio is a massive Italian-American joint in the Old Town that serves up much better than you think old school stuff like scallops and pesto cream sauce for Bruce here.  And squid ink pasta with shrimp for Buzzkill.\\n\\nMy ideal saltimbocca is most excellent in the long festering dispute across from me only makes my food taste better.\\n\\nIs Bruce\\'s attitude atypical or typical?\\n\\nHEYLIN:  It\\'s extremely ...\\n\\nBOURDIN:  Or is he a relative moderate?\\n\\nHEYLIN:  ... it\\'s extremely typical.\\n\\nBOURDIN:  I mean, he is sitting at the same table with a Cubs fan.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  Well, yes.\\n\\nELLIOT:  No, no, I drink with Cub fans.  I\\'ve even had sex with Cub fans.  I mean no I\\'m ...\\n\\nHEYLIN:  Well, the truth he told, the last time the Sox won it in \\'05.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Not that long ago, really.  Not that long ago.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  For Christ\\'s sakes, you won one.\\n\\nELLIOT:  It was this century.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  I\\'ve been on this planet ...\\n\\nELLIOT:  How about this century we\\'ve already won one?\\n\\nHEYLIN:  ... you know, I\\'ve been on this planet for 55 years, you\\'ve won one.  You know what, you guys are worse than Notre Dame fans. You\\'re worse than Notre Dame fans.\\n\\nELLIOT:  I wouldn\\'t mind winning every 25 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well ...\\n\\nHEYLIN:  Just cling onto that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean look, Chicago is a great city.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Yes it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It deserves to win, right?  I mean ...\\n\\nELLIOT:  The thing is about Chicago sports fans, we got to see the greatest basketball player that ever lived.  We were athlete that ever win.  In our prime we got to see this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nELLIOT:  So now we, we\\'re now holding things up to a higher standard of excellence.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nELLIOT:  And here\\'s what the Cub fans and Sox fans join forces to watch the Bear game.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  That\\'s something we can all agree on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You both hate the Bears?\\n\\nELLIOT:  No, no we love the Bears.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  No.  I love the Bears, but we just want Virginia to just cash in their chips and just go away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So let\\'s say, let\\'s say the planets or the stars align perfectly for Chicago in your view.  How -- what is the sports picture look like?  Who wins, who loses?  What happens?\\n\\nELLIOT:  Well first of all, there would have to be some funerals.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'d have to be funerals.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Several.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who would have to die?\\n\\nELLIOT:  I would say the owner of the Bears and then ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you agree with this?\\n\\nHEYLIN:  Yeah, if ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More or less.\\n\\nHEYLIN:  We hate owners.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Yeah, we are all united in the hatred of the owners.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I wish you both luck.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nELLIOT:  Yeah I had a little to do in the morning, so I\\'d just get up. And Roger, if he was a very fat guy, always been a very fat guy, until that person he became ill.\\n\\nBut he was indefatigable walker.  He loved to walk.  And the reason we ended up here was because in the drinking society that we were involved in at the time, never had many walkers.  But Roger was a walker, I was a walker.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Legendary film critic Roger Ebert was a man of mythic proportions in Chicago, the close friend of Bruce, half of the Siskel and Ebert duo, and a regular at the Old Town Ale House.  Roger passed away in 2013 after a long battle with cancer.\\n\\nI\\'ve been sort of conducting an informal poll over the course of the week asking people who Chicago should honor.  If you had to put up a statue, you know, the sort of the --  an iconic Chicagoan who everybody agrees is a good person.  And very popular answer, Roger Ebert.\\n\\nELLIOT:  I would say that I\\'m a little prejudice but definitely Roger Ebert deserves all the accolades he\\'s been getting justifiably so.\\n\\nRoger\\'s the guy that got me to write the blog, and he\\'s the guy that gave me the tips.  He was amazing guy and I think of course had he not become ill and really handle his illness in a way that I could -- I can\\'t even conceive of myself handling.\\n\\nI think that that really kind of set him apart from kind of the other iconic Chicago people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The guy -- and correct me if I\\'m wrong.  This was an enthusiast.  I mean this was the guy who actually liked going to the movies.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Now this is not always the case with critics.  If they don\\'t necessarily love the people or the subject matter they\\'re reviewing. Roger loved movies and he loved actors.  If you went over to his house, he would want to watch movies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Siskel and Ebert, classic, you know, it\\'s like that is an iconic relationship.  They didn\\'t seem to like each other.\\n\\nELLIOT:  They hated each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They hated each other.\\n\\nELLIOT:  Yes, I mean, they understood what they had.  But a lot of people think Siskel was the alpha.  He was not.  Roger had two things over Siskel.  He was a much better writer, and he was much better to run.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So Roger lived principally in Chicago?\\n\\nELLIOT:  Oh yes.  And he had -- believe me, he had plenty of opportunities to leave.  I mean, he was offered some serious dough to go to New York and go to L.A.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why didn\\'t he go?\\n\\nELLIOT:  In Chicago, favors are worth more than money and loyalty.  In Chicago, this is very important.  Roger is one of the most loyal people.  He was loyal to his friends, to his family.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nELLIOT:  And I just -- I don\\'t have any problem of understanding on why he decided to stay here.\\n\\n',\n",

Her three children.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My eldest is about four years now in Qatar, then the other one is two years and then other one is in Hong Kong.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Working conditions for OFWs particularly in some Gulf States can be punishing, at best, abusive or worse.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, I\\'m a single mom with my two grandchildren. I really cried a lot especially in this holiday season.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still, due to lack of opportunity at home, many Filipinos have little choice, but to go, somewhere far away, find a job, money.\\n\\nBut hopefully in a few years, you think, they come back?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nAURORA:  Yeah, I hope so.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I really ask them to go home because I\\'m not getting younger anymore.  I need them with my side.  I tell them several times they call me up, please get home soon.  I need you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:45:05] BOURDAIN:  Any Filipino watching will recognize this immediately, the balikbayan box.  A Christmas tradition, a way for OFWs to show loved ones though separated by oceans that you miss them, that you\\'re still out there.  What\\'s in these boxes?  Whatever you can send.  Little things you\\'d casually give to a loved one if you didn\\'t live on the other side of the world.  This facility alone sorts thousands of these boxes a day during the Christmas season, just one of hundreds of facilities like it.  Some five to seven million boxes a year.  That\\'s a lot of love.\\n\\nSo how many relatives do you think you have in America?\\n\\nAURORA:  In America, oh, my gosh, Seattle, California, Albert. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My ate, my eldest sister is in California.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In Hong Kong we have at least 10.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  10.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And then Dubai around eight.  And Qatar ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m at this Christmas gathering today because of one of our directors, Erik Osterholm.  It was Aurora who raised him.  For over 20 years she cared for and loved Erik and his sister, looked after his whole family.\\n\\nErik sent me a letter talking about you.  I wanted to read you what he said.  \"Aurora is such an incredible woman.  She has an infectious and loving energy that is so powerful.  I am 100 percent the man I am today because this woman literally raised me from when I was six months old.\\n\\n[21:55:00] Singing to me, dancing with me, wiping away my tears, cooking for me and making me laugh at every turn.  Unfortunately, like so many Filipinos, her story is not all smiles and love.  She had to choose a life away from her daughter and thousands of miles from her family.  There are literally thousands of people around the world, thousands of people around the world, me included, who have been influenced by her endless kindness and love.\"\\n\\nFilipinos\\' gift of themselves, of their time, their money, their love, to others.  They do and continue to do what needs to be done to survive.\\n\\nAURORA:  Edelweiss, edelweiss, every morning I greet you.  Small and white, clean and bright, bless my homeland forever, blossom of snow may you bloom and grow bloom and grow forever.  Edelweiss, edelweiss, bless my homeland forever.\\n\\nOh, my gosh, this is from Albert.  Oh, my gosh.\\n\\nThere, you can have it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That\\'s my name.\\n\\nAURORA:  I really hope you enjoy the simple gifts I send, and I know that my heart is with you always.  I love you very much.  Albert.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Joy to the world, the Lord has come.  Let earth receive her King.  Let every heart prepare Him room.  And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven, and heaven and nature sing.  He rules the world with truth and grace, and makes the nations prove.  The glories of His righteousness, and wonders of His love, and wonders of His love, and wonders of His love.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  Where does falafel come from?  Who makes the best hummus?  Is it a fence or a wall?\\n\\nBy the end of this hour, I\\'ll be seen by many as a terrorist sympathizer, a Zionist tool, a self-hating Jew, an apologist for American imperialism, an Orientalist, socialist, a fascist, CIA agent, and worse.\\n\\nSo here goes nothing.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nI was raised without religion.  One side of the family long ago, Catholic.  I think.  The other side, Jewish.  I\\'ve never been in a synagogue.  I don\\'t believe in a higher power.  But that doesn\\'t make me any less Jewish, I don\\'t think.\\n\\nThese guys sandbagging me at the wailing wall, they don\\'t seem to think so either.\\n\\nOnly half.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Jewish?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  So that makes me (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You writer?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m a writer, yes.\\n\\n(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mazel tov.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mazel tov.  Thank you, gentlemen.\\n\\nI\\'ve never felt so much like I\\'m masquerading as something I\\'m not.  I am instinctively hostile to any kind of devotion.  Certainty is my enemy.  You know, I\\'m all about doubt, questioning one\\'s self and the nature of reality.  Constantly.\\n\\nWhen they grabbed hold of me and in a totally nonjudgmental way essentially, you know, God\\'s happy to have you, you know, here you go. Oh, man.  You know.  My treachery is complete.  Just because I was raised outside the faith with no particular\\n\\nattachment or loyalty to Israel doesn\\'t mean that plenty of people on this earth don\\'t hate me in principle.  I know that.  But the state of Israel, I never really knew what to think.\\n\\nFirst look around, it\\'s like everybody says -- it\\'s pretty.  It\\'s awesome.  It\\'s urban.  Sophisticated.  Hip.  Like Southern California. Only nicer.  Then you see the young draftees in the streets and you start to get the idea.\\n\\nThis is Jerusalem.\\n\\nYOTAM OTTOLENGHI, CHEF/AUTHOR:  I\\'m taking you through Damascus Gate, which is one of the gates to the old city.  And these walls are pretty ancient.  People say that the gates go back to King David.  And then as history progressed, they built up the wall.  So the top bed is the newest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And by newest you mean --\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  I mean, up to about the Ottoman time which -- the Turks left here about 150 years ago.  And the Brits came and they conquered us.  I wasn\\'t here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Born here, now cooking in London, Yotam Ottolenghi is the widely known respected chef and co-author of the book \"Jerusalem.\"\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Basically, this city was divided into two until 1967 when there was the famous Six-Day War.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  And the hall of the -- we\\'re traveling in now, walking in, is east Jerusalem.  It\\'s the Palestinian part.  And that was up until \\'67 was belonged to Jordan.  So now it\\'s under Israeli control. Very controversial because for the Jews, for the Israelis, the city has been unified.  But obviously for the Palestinian, they are under occupation, as far as they are concerned.\\n\\nWe just have to go for a falafel because it\\'s so much part of the culture here.  And again, contentious because, you know, Jews or Israelis make falafel their own and everybody in the world thinks falafel is -- you know, an Israeli food.  The actual fact it\\'s (INAUDIBLE) food even more so, because, you know, it\\'s been done for generations here.\\n\\nAnd here, you get falafel that\\'s just been fried.  You don\\'t get it any other way.  When I come to a place like that, and I see there\\'s a few left from the previous customer, I don\\'t take that.  I want them to fry them for me.  That makes all the difference in the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a whole different animal, isn\\'t it?  So is there a historically provable answer to who invented it?\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Who made it first.  The one thing that\\'s very clear that -- in this part of the world, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, it\\'s been cooked for many, many, many generations.  On the other hand, you get like Jews from Yemen coming here --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  So they can say hey, my great uncle was in Syria at the time.  Hey, I remember distinctly --\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  So there is actually no answer to it.  But the question of food appropriation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Or who owns the food (INAUDIBLE).  If you can go on arguing about it forever.\\n\\nThe old city is divided into four quarters.  There is Muslim quarter. There is a Jewish quarter.  There is a Christian quarter.  And there\\'s an Armenian quarter.  Each one functions independently, but people that live in the certain area are all from that religion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  So here you see these Israeli flags over this house.  So basically Jews have bought this house, although it\\'s in the Muslim quarter.  And that\\'s very controversial because it breaks the separation that people would normally expect in this city.\\n\\nNow we\\'re walking in the steps of Jesus Christ, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As I so often do.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  So this is Via Dolorosa, which is the last trip Jesus did before he was crucified.  So people feel very emotional.  They come here and they feel like oh, my god, I am walking in the steps of Muhammad, David, or Jesus.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s like Jesus was here.  I feel like I should be more something.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  A little bit more pious?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A little bit.  Well, it\\'s too late for me.\\n\\nGreat.  You get your own crown of thorns?\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In answer to the question, what would Jesus wear?\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh no, no, no.  That\\'s just wrong.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Israel is bordered by Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and then next east Jerusalem.\\n\\nIn 2003, Israel began construction on a wall along the green line representing the Israeli-Palestinian border.  The wall now stretches 450 miles.  When completed, it will span 700 miles.  Eighty-five percent of it in Palestinian territory.  On one hand, there\\'s no doubt that the number of suicide bombings fell drastically.\\n\\nOn the other, there\\'s this.  You cross from Jerusalem into the West Bank.  Also called Judea, Samaria, also called Palestine.\\n\\nSince 1967, half a million settlers have moved here, all in contravention of international law.  Many in contravention of Israeli law, though in effect, it seems to make little difference.  They\\'re here and in ever-larger numbers.\\n\\nThis is Nolan (ph), one of our drivers from Tel Aviv, who I asked about the graffiti on this house near the settlements.\\n\\nSo what is price tagging?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Something happens in a settlement or some attack with Jews, kids from the settlement would come and have a price tag for every activity.  So they come to a Palestinian village like this, they will destroy cars, they will write on walls like this.  It says, \"Against Arabs, the state of Israel is alive, and death to the Arabs.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Intimidating.  I mean, you put two targets on my house, I\\'m moving.\\n\\nThis is Eli, a settlement with a population of over 3,000, relatively isolated from the rest of Israel.  Amiad Cohen is the chief executive of the Eli settlement and its former head of security.\\n\\nAMIAD COHEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ELI SETTLEMENT:  Here you see from up above most of our town.  You see the Palestinian villages all around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s an unusual situation.  A lot of your neighbors would very much like you to not be here.\\n\\nCOHEN:  I know most of them.  And most of them, they are happy that we\\'re here.  Because we -- actually we gave them prosperity for the past 45 years.  And wherever the PLO came, they lost it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m guessing a lot of people would disagree with that statement.\\n\\nCOHEN:  High tech security, radars and cameras.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So from the high ground, you can see anybody walking at night.  You could see from pretty far out.\\n\\nCOHEN:  Definitely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Could you identify them after the fact?\\n\\nCOHEN:  Depends.  What we have are protocols that we work with.  And we had our successes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We drive to Ma\\'ale Levona, another settlement a few miles away.  Hot, sun-bleached, suburban feeling.  Behind its ring of electronic surveillance, censors and security, everything they feel they need.  A school, public transportation, and a petting zoo.\\n\\nAmichai Luria has lived here for 23 years.  He\\'s a wine maker and amateur cook.\\n\\nWow.  You\\'re not kidding around.\\n\\nAMICHAI LURIA, WINE MAKER AND COOK:  The salmon is marinated with pomegranate juice that -- on the season, I squeeze pomegranates.  And I freeze the juice so I\\'ll have it all year round.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where were you before here?\\n\\nLURIA:  I was born in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So your parents brought you over at age 4?\\n\\nLURIA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (INAUDIBLE) kids living in the relative comfort and familiarity of Pennsylvania.  Heading off to what must have, at least in part of their mind, would seem an uncertain.\\n\\nLURIA:  Yes.  It was very difficult for them.  Almost all Jews say next year in Jerusalem.  It\\'s part of prayers that we say all the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If I\\'m understanding it correctly, you\\'re -- the bible, it\\'s all right there.  It all happened here.  That\\'s sort of a nonnegotiable position.\\n\\nLURIA:  You see prophesies coming true.  Things coming to life again. You know, mountains that nobody wanted to live on, nobody dared to -- for thousands of years, nobody wanted this place.  You know.  And then finally, we come here and everything is flourishing again.  It makes you feel good, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve been here since \\'90.  You look over the edge there, there\\'s an Arab village right --\\n\\nLURIA:  Yes.  There is one that you can see from here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At any point during that time, you ever go to anybody\\'s house, sit down and eat?\\n\\nLURIA:  Not there, but in other villages.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ever sat down at a Muslim table?\\n\\nLURIA:  Muslim table --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You host and everybody else --\\n\\nLURIA:  Coffee.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But not there.\\n\\nLURIA:  No, because I don\\'t -- as a religious Jew, I eat only kosher. So they respect that.  So they don\\'t offer me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So I\\'ve got to ask you about something that troubled me. Coming up, the first house before you come up the drive to this village, the graffiti on the front --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The targets spray painted on.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whodunit?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Villains.  Bad people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kids?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t know.  Apparently kids.  When we educate kids, kids are not able to understand complicated things.  They see the world in black and white.  When you get older, you\\'re able to see the gray.  And when someone hits you --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I understand why kids would do it.  Given what you told me earlier, identifying the perpetrators within the realm of possibility?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re young people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not paint it over?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good question.  I don\\'t know.  Maybe we should. You\\'re right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Elsewhere in the West Bank, just outside of Ramallah, meet Betty Saadeh and Mona Ennab.  Two members of a group of women who call themselves the Speed Sisters.  The first all-female Palestinian racing team.\\n\\nBETTY SAADEH, SPEED SISTERS RACING TEAM:  Hi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hi.  I\\'m Tony.  Good to meet you.\\n\\nSAADEH:  When I\\'m riding a car, I\\'m the happiest girl ever.  Racing, it\\'s in my blood.  Here in Palestine, it\\'s very small.  There\\'s no roads.  So when I drive, I speed.  I feel free.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you find that people underestimated you at first?\\n\\nSAADEH:  At the beginning, they could maybe make fun of us.  But when we got good scores, we win respect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now they know.\\n\\nSAADEH:  Yes.  Well, a car doesn\\'t know if you\\'re a woman or a man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nSAADEH:  A lot of girls want to join us as Speed Sisters.  But some of their families, they are very reserved.  Their don\\'t like their daughters to be between men racing.  You know.  Palestine is a very reserved society.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So are things getting better?  Staying the same, or worse?\\n\\nSAADEH:  You never know what\\'s going to happen in Palestine.  One day it\\'s good and the other day it\\'s just -- you never know.  It\\'s a crazy country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The local police would prefer them off the streets for obvious reasons.  But the track here, such as it is, has its drawbacks.  It\\'s basically a parking lot across from the Ofer Detention Center.\\n\\nWhat do they think about this next door?  Do they ever give you problems?\\n\\nSAADEH:  This is an Israeli jail.  It\\'s called Ofer.  One time we were here with Speed Sisters and there was problems because of the prisoners.  So I just stopped my car over there and I was walking.  I wanted to see what\\'s going on.  And the Israeli soldiers, they came running at me and they start shooting at me.  And I got -- I got shot in the back.  It was a tear gas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The canister hit you.\\n\\nSAADEH:  Yes.  So my Speed Sisters, they took me to the hospital.  I fainted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you thought of challenging the Israelis to put up a team?\\n\\nSAADEH:  I can\\'t race because my car is Palestinian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What if they come over here?\\n\\nSAADEH:  They\\'re not allowed to enter the West Bank and we\\'re not allowed to go to Jerusalem, so how can we race together?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  Silly question.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s right there for all to see.  And it feels like something out of a science fiction film.  This is the wall.  From the other side, from inside this place, for instance, the Aida Refugee Camp in the district of Bethlehem, it doesn\\'t feel like anything other than what it is.  A prison.\\n\\nAbed Abusrour is the founder of the Al Rowwad Children\\'s Theatre Center.\\n\\nABED ABUSROUR, FOUNDER, AL ROWWAD CHILDREN\\'S THEATRE CENTER:  So we are at the north entrance of Bethlehem, and heading to Aida Refugee Camp.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this has been here since 1950.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Yes.  It started with tents.  People were under the tents for about seven years.  And later on the U.N. saw that it was not temporary as it was supposed to be so they started building what they call shelters.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First impressions of the camp, there\\'s a remarkable number of kids.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Now it\\'s about 6,000 people.  And the two-thirds are under 18 years old.  So it\\'s a very young population.  Unfortunately, with the continuing degradation of political and economic situation, we are in the situation where we have no playgrounds or (INAUDIBLE) spaces anymore.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Children play in the streets beneath walls covered in images of martyrs, plane hijackers, political prisoners.\\n\\nSix thousand people, of that number, 66 percent are under the age of 18.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t care where that is in the world, that\\'s pretty much a recipe for unruly behavior, I think would be the best.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Well, yes.  Especially when you don\\'t have any possibilities to evacuate the anger and the stress in a creative way. So after I finished my studies, I came back here and I started using theatre as one of the most amazing, powerful, civilized and nonviolent means to express yourself.  To tell your story.  To be truthful.\\n\\nAnd this is for me the remedy to build peace within.  And hopefully help them to think that they can grow up and change the world and create miracles.  Without the need to carry a gun and (INAUDIBLE) and explode themselves or burn themselves.  But to stay alive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Abed takes me to the camp\\'s martyrs quarter to be fed by (INAUDIBLE).  She runs a women\\'s collective offering Palestinian cooking classes, helping her provide for six children, one of whom is disabled.\\n\\nIn America, kids grow up with pop stars, sports players.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Never a politician.  I mean, it\\'s unthinkable for a child to look up to a politician or to look up to a military figure.  Sports or entertainment.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here, kids 4 or 5 years old every day, they\\'re looking at somebody who, you know, brought down a plane.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not questioning why that is.\\n\\nABUSROUR:  I know.  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think it\\'s helpful?\\n\\nABUSROUR:  Well, I guess we have a history.  We are people who are under occupation.  People honor their heroes.  And their heroes are those who resist the occupation.  Whether they resisted it with armed struggle or non-violence.\\n\\nAnd to tell you the truth, sometimes I have been invited with some political parties, when they put images of people who are killed in their own houses.  Ahmed\\'s sister, in the 29th of October, 2001, she was killed in her kitchen by a sniper from the Intercontinental Hotel. But when these political parties take this woman and want to make a montage of photos with her carrying a gun to say this is the hero proliferated the Palestine, sorry, this is not the truth.\\n\\nThis woman was killed in her house.  We will go today and ask the Palestinians who is the great hero?  You ask these kids, who will they recognize?  They will recognize a young man from Gaza who is on \"Arab Idol\" named Mohamed Assa, a singer, who sings.  He becomes more famous than Abu Mazen and Arafat and everybody else.\\n\\nThis is another image of Palestine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can almost believe for a minute or two that some kind of peace, some kind of reconciliation, meeting of the minds, sanity is possible after you visit Majda.  It\\'s a restaurant in what looks like an idyllic village in the Judean Hills, about 20 minutes from Jerusalem.  It feels like an alternate universe for a number of reasons.\\n\\nMichal Baranes is Jewish.  Yaakov Barhum is Muslim, from a nearby village.  They\\'re partners, co-owners of Majda, and also married. They\\'re unsurprisingly friends of Yotam.  Together they grow and raise much of what\\'s used in their kitchen.  Their food reflects both their different backgrounds and their commonalities.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  We\\'re going to spoil you now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, here we go.  So you grew up in this town.\\n\\nYAAKOV BARHUM, OWNER, MAJDA RESTAURANT:  Yes, in this village.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where did you grow up?\\n\\nMICHAL BARANES, OWNER, MAJDA RESTAURANT:  Near the beach.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Near the beach.\\n\\nBARANES:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not the neighborhood.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBARHUM:  But we met in the neighborhood.  In Kibutzka (INAUDIBLE). And then we worked together in hotel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did that go down the families?\\n\\nBARHUM:  Wonderful now.  Now wonderful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now good.  In the beginning, not so much.\\n\\nBARHUM:  Started with a, you know, with all those questions. Understand that we love each other and they can do nothing, so we continue and they support us.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  This is your special fried eggs.  Sunny side up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Farm eggs with peppers from your garden.  Tomato.  That looks awesome beyond words.  It is incredibly beautiful here.  I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t expect that.\\n\\nBARANES:  You know, a lot of people come and say it\\'s like Provence, it\\'s like Italy.  And I said, no, (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  You like it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do.  Roasted tomatoes, okra.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Onion and mint.  And that\\'s all they do.  What they do a lot here is char the hell out of it.  So it\\'s like this, really smoky just from being in the pan on very high heat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So generally speaking, who lives in this area?  Mostly Arab -- ethnically Arab in this part of town?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Michael is the only Jewish in the village.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this --\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Zucchini that\\'s been grilled.  And then we use the fried yogurt, so that\\'s the sauce.  So it\\'s like that intense kind of go-to flavor.  Very typical for Palestinian cooking.  Right?\\n\\nBARANES:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  It\\'s good.\\n\\nI just had this incredibly delicious meal completely oblivious to the fact that it\\'s entirely vegetarian.  If any of the vegetarian restaurants in New York served food that tasted anywhere near this, I would be -- I would actually go there.  I\\'d consider it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAnd this?\\n\\nBARANES:  Fried zucchini with mint.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  And the apricots.  The little sweet apricots we had.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s really intensely delicious.\\n\\nAre you hopeful?\\n\\nBARANES:  Of course.  I have my children.  I need to say that.\\n\\nBARHUM:  I respect her religion.  She respects my religion.  And together we can build something for our kids.  Our future.  That\\'s what we think and that\\'s what we give the message for our customers.\\n\\nOTTOLENGHI:  Part of the attraction of this restaurant, the fact that it actually manages to do what not so many chefs try to do here, and that is sort of mix your Jewish ethnicity or background with Arab foods.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Getting in and out of Gaza from Israel is truly one of the most surreal travel experiences you could have on earth.  Over 1.5 million people live in Gaza.  Most of them considered refugees. Meaning they\\'re not from the place they\\'re compelled to live now.  In most cases, they\\'re either prohibited from or unable to leave.\\n\\nIsrael decides who comes and goes.  What gets in and what stays out. Apart from journalists, aid workers, emergency responders, very few people are allowed to cross into Gaza.  In 2005, the Israeli defense forces left the Gaza Strip and all Israeli settlers were removed.\\n\\nNow inside Gaza, Hamas is in charge.  Considered a terrorist organization by both the United States and Israel, they got elected in 2006.\\n\\nThis is Laila Haddad, a native Gazan, journalist and author of \"The Gaza Kitchen.\"\\n\\nLAILA HADDAD, \"THE GAZA KITCHEN\" AUTHOR:  The catches are not as big as they used to be, and that\\'s primarily because the fishermen can\\'t go beyond three to six nautical miles.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Could you envision what happens?  HADDAD:  They\\'ll shoot at the fishermen, they\\'ll spray cold water at\\n\\nthem, they\\'ll destroy their boats, they\\'ll cut their fishing nets, they\\'ll detain them.  So it\\'s obviously really risky business.  Nine nautical miles, that\\'s where that deep sea channel is where you\\'re going to get the really good catches.\\n\\nGaza is the last Palestinian area with access to the coast.  And that\\'s really important to remember.  You know you have the West Bank just an hour away, but many of the Palestinians, they have never seen the sea, have never been to the sea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nThe (INAUDIBLE) family owns a small farm in the (INAUDIBLE) area of the eastern Gaza Strip.  (INAUDIBLE) Sultan and her husband are unusual in that they cook together.  This is not typical in this part of the world or in this culture.  They use their own fresh-killed chickens to make the Gazan classic Maqluba.  The traditional Palestinian dish comprised of layers of fried eggplant, tomato, potatoes, caramelized onions, and chicken sauteed then simmered in a broth with nutmeg, cinnamon, cardimum, and rice.\\n\\nIt\\'s a big family.  Children, grandchildren, all living under the same roof, and it can get chaotic.\\n\\nSo let\\'s talk about food and eat food because it\\'s just (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nHADDAD:  Yes, yes, sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tell me, what do we have here?\\n\\nHADDAD:  OK.  So this is called Maaluba or Maqluba.  Traditionally with lamb, in this case chicken.  They\\'re very concerned that we\\'re being very rude and we\\'re not --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Please.\\n\\nHADDAD:  We\\'re not allowing the others to eat.  He\\'s saying how can you be eating and you\\'re letting everybody stand.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nHADDAD:  For me, being from Gaza, being a child of diaspara, I always thought food was a really interesting way to be able to tell the Palestinian story.  Being able to discover this lost history, this Palestinian past.  Plus, the food is really dang good.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  That it is.\\n\\nHADDAD:  And it was I think also important to be able to provide Palestinians an image of themselves that they recognize, a very humane image, because all they\\'re seeing in the media, whether here or there, whether on Arabic channels or abroad, you know, is this kind of very caricatured images of gunned men and this kind of grim cinderblock landscape.\\n\\nYou\\'re not entering into the private homes.  What does a kitchen look like, or what does, you know, a family you see here.\\n\\nYes.  Do you like it, she\\'s asking?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Absolutely delicious.  Really, really good.\\n\\nHADDAD:  Yes?  She wants you to open a restaurant for her.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Keep cooking like this.  It\\'s really delicious.\\n\\nHADDAD:  Gaza has three distinctive culinary heritages.  Those who hail from villages that were either depopulated or destroyed in 1948. And they constitute about 75 percent to the population of Gaza.  And they kind of bring with them their own distinct cuisine.  That\\'s very different from the cuisine of the city, Gaza City, which tends to use much more heat, much more chili peppers, from the cuisine of the coast, which is rich with seafood, of course, and a very sophisticated, very urbane cuisine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whatever you think is still there.  Will -- in your lifetime, I guess the first question would be, in your lifetime, will you be able to visit Yahba?\\n\\nHADDAD:  She says, you know, she hopes she can.  She also hopes she can go to Jerusalem as well.  So she\\'s optimistic.  Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What --\\n\\nHADDAD:  She\\'s saying -- first she said you\\'re not allowing us to. Then self-corrected and said the Israelis aren\\'t allowing us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Go, go.\\n\\n(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nHADDAD:  This is a normal tone of voice.  He\\'s not upset, by the way. This is how we talk.  We yell.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s he saying?\\n\\nHADDAD:  He\\'s saying, you know, give me a permit.  If they allow, of course I\\'ll go.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN:  Laila\\'s got something to show me.  A watermelon salad she discovered on her recent trip here that\\'s really piqued her interest. So off we go.  I figured, this will take a minute.\\n\\nWe arrived at what looks like a pretty serious gathering.  This is a duwan, and we\\'re soon joined by her Um Sultan\\'s husband Abu.\\n\\nHADDAD:  It\\'s an area where kind of the elders gather to, you know, resolve community problems, to, you know, kind of advise.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All these guys are originally from (INAUDIBLE), now part of Israel, so they\\'re bound together by traditions and a way of life very different from here, where they\\'ve been relocated and lived since 1948.\\n\\nDoes he think he\\'ll be able to go to his ancestral homeland in his lifetime, his children\\'s lifetime?  What\\'s his guess?\\n\\nHADDAD:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We will return.\\n\\nHADDAD:  Whether now we\\'re 100 years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our Quran, our instrument, told us this.\\n\\nHADDAD:  It\\'s pre-ordained, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This enemy back me.  Please kill him.  And we understand that.  We hope.  Me, my son.  My daughter.\\n\\nHADDAD:  So what they\\'re making now is called (INAUDIBLE), is basically a baby watermelon, under ripe watermelon.  And this is kind of a specialty of southern Gaza generally but also Sinai.  It\\'s usually something that\\'s made specifically by men, as I was told here. So they begin, you can see over they\\'re fire roasting the baby watermelons.  They cover them with aluminum foil.\\n\\nIn addition, they put them through a wire, kind of like, sort of rustic skewer.  And then yes, they just throw them in there.  And then the idea is that they take the pulp out, so that\\'s what\\'s going on. Yes, and then what they do while that\\'s fire roasting is they knead an unleavened dough over there with whole-wheat, barley, plenty of really rich, extra virgin olive oil.  And then they throw that into the pit as well, or they dig a pit in the sand over there.  And that\\'s fire based.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right in the coals?\\n\\nHADDAD:  Yes.  And then they mix that all together.  So it\\'s interesting.  Because right now, we\\'re about, what, 35 minutes away from Gaza City.  Ask anyone in Gaza City if they\\'ve heard of this dish and --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHADDAD:  No.  So you\\'re an area as small as Gaza, you see this very wide variation.  They\\'re going to clean it up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Many, if not most of these guys, are not too sympathetic to my country or my ethnicity, I\\'m guessing.  But there\\'s that hospitality thing.  Anywhere you go in the Muslim world, it seems.  No matter what, you feed your guests and do your best to make them feel at home.\\n\\nHADDAD:  We have to eat.  Maybe we should -- you\\'re supposed to eat this with your hands.  Very good.  He\\'s saying if you eat this, you shouldn\\'t have another meal for three days.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where does this dish come from?\\n\\nHADDAD:  This is a dish that\\'s native to southern Gaza, the Sinai, the -- sort of the Desert Bedouin areas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All the food I\\'ve had so far in Gaza has been very different than in anything else I\\'ve had in the Arab world.  Different flavor spectrum.\\n\\nHADDAD:  Yes.  Totally.  It\\'s kind of this -- its own little gastronomical bubble.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why are you not using a spoon?\\n\\nHADDAD:  You know, I find that the food has more flavor, I get a better sensory experience.  They have children, they like to eat with their hands.  He\\'s saying God gave us hands to eat with, not spoons.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One can be forgiven for thinking, when you see how similar they are, the two peoples, both of them cook with pride, eat with passion, love their kids, love the land in which they live or the land they dream of returning to, who live so close, who are locked in such an intimate, if deadly embrace, might somehow, some day, figure out how to live with each other.\\n\\nBut that would be very mushy thinking indeed.  Those things in the end probably don\\'t count for much at all.\\n\\nGatan Galkowitz runs a restaurant just seven miles from the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nYou and your family have paid the worst imaginable price.\\n\\nGATAN GALKOWITZ, GAZA STRIP RESTAURANT OWNER:  Yes.  My daughter was killed by a mortar sent by Hamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In some Israeli towns and villages within close proximity of the Gaza Strip, bus stops double as bomb shelters, and air raid sirens warn of incoming missiles fired from less than a mile away. Rockets and mortar shells have been known to fall from the sky in these parts and no one understands the consequences more than this man.\\n\\nYou were not a fervent ideological Zionist.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were not an orthodox Jew.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And yet here you are, at the spear point, right at the dip. Here\\'s your restaurant.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  This is a shelter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is a shelter.  Here you are.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  After the death of my daughter, I just start to talk, to whom?  To people who want to listen.  I know that my daughter was killed for no reason and I know that people on the other side have been killed for no reason.  Childrens, old people.  I have been a soldier in Gaza.  I saw very poor people.  I know there is interest in keeping this poor people.  You can go far, far, but the bottom line is, let\\'s stop with the suffering.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, I went to this settler community and I --\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  Nice people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And I said to you, you know, they were nice.  And you said, you said -- what did you say?  You said, they\\'re all nice.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  They are all nice.  I know, nice, very nice Palestinian people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re all nice, but if you scratch, if you push, they all want -- but they\\'ll all say, throw them in the sea.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  Most of the people, they don\\'t talk.  They are very upset. They are fed up.  And the same goes from the other side to us.  You have to find the right people on both village, also on the down, also on the up, and maybe they talk.  And I am sure that is possible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The opportunities to do that here are very, very, very limited, it seemed.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  I agree.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And I mean, one doesn\\'t even have to speak metaphorically, because there is an actual wall.\\n\\nGALKOWITZ:  There is a wall.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or a fence, depending on who you\\'re talking to.  GALKOWITZ:  Fence or wall.  No, it\\'s a big wall.  It\\'s ugly.  It\\'s\\n\\nreally ugly.  You can see it, it\\'s not far away from here.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nJOHN F. KENNEDY, 35TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Good evening, my fellow citizens.  This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba.\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  This is the Cuba I grew up with.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mankind, teeters precariously on the brink of a thermonuclear war.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The missile crisis, duck and cover, hide under your desk, kids, cover yourselves with wet newspaper because we\\'re all going to die.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The flames of crisis burn far stronger, fed and fanned by the bitter tirades of Fidel Castro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this guy, always in the fatigues, underlining with every appearance that we were two nations in a never-ending state of war.\\n\\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Today, the United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba.  We will begin to normalize relations between our two countries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Cuba has been sitting here for, what, 55 years now?  Half an hour away, basically giving the biggest superpower in the world the stiff middle finger.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Fifty-plus years of animosity, embargo, rationing, and Fidel Castro is still hanging on.  But recently, there are powerful indications that everything is about to change.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are at Hymanita (ph), a little fishing town.  This place is called Casa Santione\\'s (ph) by two brothers that go out and fish every morning, bring fresh seafood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  OK, humble fishing village, traditional fishing family?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about the sushi?  What\\'s going on in this country, man?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Things are changing, Anthony, what can I say?\\n\\nMy name is Hugo Canseo (ph).  I was born in Cuba.  I was in one of Cuba\\'s most prominent schools when I made a joke about President Fidel Castro.  I was a teenager.  And the kid that slept on the bunk bed on top of me recorded our conversation.  And I was expelled from school.\\n\\nMy mom said the only choice it for us to leave Cuba.  I\\'m a businessman.  I\\'ve lived in Miami for 35 years.  It\\'s my home base.  I come back and forth to Cuba.  I\\'ve been coming to Cuba for over 20 years.  I mean, Cuba is a communist country in economic transition.\\n\\nSince Raul Castro has allowed Cubans to establish more businesses, there are people that are making money, there are people that have created a tremendous amount of wealth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  People with family connections to the States, people tied to the exploding tourist industry, small business owners, taxi drivers, people operating in ever-changing gray areas of what is permissible.\\n\\n(on camera):  How\\'s it work right now?  If you\\'re Cuban, you can sell your property...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To another Cuban from Cuba.  And that\\'s what\\'s happening right now, a lot of Cuban-Americans, a lot of Cubans living abroad are now coming back and through relatives are buying property.\\n\\nObviously somebody has touched this building with some kind of investment.  It\\'s renovated.  It seems to be like a hotel.  Somebody bought the building and turned it into a little hotel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  However you feel about the government, however you feel about the last 55 years, there aren\\'t any places in the world that look like this.  I mean, it\\'s utterly enchanting.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s very seductive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is no doubt in my mind that somewhere in the offices of like the Four Seasons hotel chain, they\\'re looking at the sea front and thinking, you know, one of these days.  You know, and cruise ships, you know, what happens then?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, look...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this an inevitable march of progress?  Am I being a snob?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no, you\\'re being very realistic.  That\\'s the concern of most Cubans.  I wouldn\\'t mind seeing one or two Starbucks around Havana, but hoping we don\\'t go back to 1958, where the majority of Cuban companies were owned by American corporations.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have got to believe that Cuba will want to reserve some of the value that represents, you know, the hearts and soul of the Cuban people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Last time I was in Havana, a meal at a paladar would have been rice and beans.  Now, sushi.  A certain sign of impending apocalypse.\\n\\n(on camera):  That\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ten years ago this restaurant would have never been allowed, not only because private businesses were not allowed, but the external influence that you\\'re seeing.\\n\\nRemember, this is a country where chewing gum or listening to The Beatles were prohibited.  I don\\'t think we all need to have Twitter every day.  I mean, one of the things I love about coming to Cuba is the fact that I can put my iPhone away.\\n\\nWho cares?  Look what we have around us.  And I hope that Cubans, as continue to have access to free information, they still want to preserve these family times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tourists have been coming to Cuba for some time.  Predominantly Europeans, many of them men of a certain age looking for, how shall we say, company.\\n\\nBut now it looks like Americans looking to live out fantasies of \"Godfather II,\" will soon be able to do so.  And it\\'s all still here for them.\\n\\nBut there\\'s new stuff, too.  This is certainly new.  Fabrica de Arte, the hottest spot in Havana.  A nightclub, performance space, art gallery, highlighting artists, musicians and deejays from around the world.  Questlove is scheduled to deejay here tomorrow night.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s like a big bag (ph) when all the arts can fit inside.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\n(voice-over):  What is going on here?  I ask Inti Herrera and X Alfonso, two of the young entrepreneurs behind the place.\\n\\n(on camera):  Nothing like this ever existed before.  Did the government bureau of arts help you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We had -- at the beginning, we had subsidies from the ministry of culture.  Even the building, we asked for the building because it was abandoned for 13 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The place is very popular.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right now, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who comes here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These people that love art but at the same time, it\\'s very diverse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It attracts a once unthinkable mix of foreigners and locals that enjoys the actual support of the government, without whom, of course, it couldn\\'t exist.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our chef here, we said, is part of the art world, you know, here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A ceviche of dogfish with pickled vegetables.  Loin of pork, pan-seared with yucca and a riff on a traditional orange sauce with garlic and coriander.\\n\\n(on camera):  Mmm, good.\\n\\nWhat do you think is going to happen when the door opens and you have got hundreds of thousands of Americans flooding here, looking desperately to spend money on anything Cuban?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t know, man.  We are a small country. We have to adapt to new things.  But I think it\\'s a good challenge.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I guess I\\'m asking, how do you keep it real when you\\'ll all probably be millionaires in a few years?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Us?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You think so?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s not our goal in life, but that\\'s...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Doesn\\'t matter?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, it doesn\\'t matter.  We\\'re going to have booths (ph) and more backers (ph).\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More backers (ph).\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Havana still looks like you want it to look.  Or maybe just how I want it to look.  What was once one of the wealthiest cities in Latin America, left to the elements, left to collapse, were frozen gloriously in time.       In fits and starts, Cuba is changing, but it\\'s not sugar or rum\\n\\nor tobacco or casino gambling that is the new god.  It\\'s tourism.\\n\\n(on camera):  All right.  So here, Chinatown, such as it is.  But are there any Chinese left in Havana?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  There\\'s a few new Chinese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At one point the Chinese community in Cuba was huge, but they pretty much cleared out after the revolution, as did most of the Russian-Jewish emigres who were here.\\n\\nSo the state has erected a few quintessentially Chinatown gates, mustered the 14 Chinese people left in Havana to summon their relatives.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  For more than 35 years, John Lee Anderson (ph) has been reporting from conflict zones such as Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I lied about my age and traveled around Africa.  When I was 13, I told people I was 26.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In the early 1990s, while researching a biography of Che Guevara, he and his family moved to Cuba and ended up staying for three years.\\n\\n(on camera):  You lived here during the special period, which was not so special.  That was the bad times.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That was the bad times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Russians had pulled out.  Soviets all done.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The economy went like this, 90 percent, it just tanked.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Cuba lost 80 percent of its import goods, which led to widespread hunger, malnutrition, and a nosedive for the already difficult quality of life on the island.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was one place where we could buy food, which was a Soviet-style place with food that was flown in.  Quite bad food.  Under Fidel\\'s rule, that\\'s the way it was.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s like a cargo cult version of Chinese food here. Dumplings.  The Szechuan chicken dish that\\'s about as Szechuan as, well, I am.\\n\\n(on camera):  What\\'s going to happen?  What\\'s next?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The uptick in tourism, just after the December 17th announcement -- the surprise announcement by Raul and Obama in which they said, we have decided to make friends again, the surge in tourism and American interest in Cuba is like this.\\n\\nYou now have an island where every room is for rent because you can make $30 or $40 a day.  That\\'s more than a state employee makes in three months.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There will be wealthy hipsters, women in tiny black dresses drinking ironic riffs on the mojito, the lobby of the spanking new W Hotel with \"oonce-oonce-oonce\" in the background, and that\\'s within five years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I would say so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Will every Cuban have an inalienable right to free medical care and education at that time?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what they\\'re worried about.  The last time I was here, which was in 2013, I counted eight to 10 homeless, garbage-eating people in the street.  And I thought, wow, I\\'ve never seen that before in Cuba.\\n\\nThat\\'s something that the old Cuba, the socialist Cuba that could look after all of its citizens, would never have allowed.  It\\'s allowing it now.  This period we\\'re here in, it\\'s the lull before it all hits.\\n\\nThe train is coming.  It\\'s either going to roar by and they\\'re going to be able to jump on and go with it, or it\\'s going to derail and it will be a mess.  All of it\\'s possible.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My mom is asking me if you would like to taste the rice?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, it\\'s fantastic.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Like a lot of Cubans, Yosimi Rodriguez (ph) lives in same working class neighborhood where she was born.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I live with my mom, my sister, my niece. Of course I would like to have my own bedroom.  But there are people who don\\'t have a house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were a translator, is that correct?  And you are now a journalist?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, well, I\\'ve been writing for Havana Times and then I write also for (INAUDIBLE), which is another independent Web site.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  She struggles to eke out a living in an industry where the state firmly controls all media.\\n\\n(on camera):  What subjects in particular are of interest to you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Racial issues.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Racial disparity.  Now this is something that the revolution promised to address.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Their main mistake was to say that they had eradicated racism, that just like it could be eradicated just like that.  On the street, for instance, policemen, the first people they stop, black people.  If you\\'re black, you are a potential criminal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Her mom, Rosa (ph), prepares a cabbage stew with carrots, tomatoes, and green beans for her as Yosimi is a rare vegetarian on an island where pork is king.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh, fantastic, look at that.\\n\\n(voice-over):  And for us, pork marinated in garlic, onion, and sour orange.\\n\\n(on camera):  Please tell your mom it\\'s superb, really excellent.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mom, (SPEAKING SPANISH).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nYou have a very highly educated public here, one of the most literate nations on earth.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That\\'s funny, we are highly educated, as you said, but we\\'re behind concerning Internet and all that stuff. Most the folks have access to only the official media, the official newspaper.\\n\\nIf Internet comes, and I think the government is trying to delay it, if that comes, many things will change.  People will have access to different points of view, and I don\\'t think our government wants that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If everything goes well, what will Havana be like? What will this neighborhood be like in five years?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know, having a prosperous society doesn\\'t guarantee that it is the same for everyone.  You know, you see these people who have been able to use opportunities to open businesses, to open successful restaurants.\\n\\nThose opportunities are there, but I cannot use them because I don\\'t have money.  I don\\'t think it is possible to have a perfect society, but I think it is possible to try.\\n\\nHow you like the food?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, it\\'s delicious.  Really good.  Thank you.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)      BOURDAIN (voice-over):  All Cuba seems waiting for something.\\n\\nFor whatever it is that happens next.  Today, that\\'s the roar of Detroit\\'s finest.  Circa 1959 and before, of course.  American dream machines tricked out, babied, pampered, jury-rigged or simply held together with duct tape and bailing wire.\\n\\n(on camera):  Nice.  What\\'s under the hood?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING SPANISH)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  V8 American engines.  We buy spares.  We bring the spares from America.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING SPANISH)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All we think about through the week is our machines, our V8 engines.  You know, car racing in Cuba, they love it here as much as they love baseball.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa, that\\'s serious.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Los Amigos del Motor are diehard gearheads, drag racers who for more than 20 years have been defying the law and escaping the grind of daily life by pressing pedal to the metal and hurdling down the highway faster, faster, fast as they can go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They just find the best part of the day when there\\'s not so much traffic.  You get hundreds and hundreds of people on both sides of the road.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Now before it was absolutely illegal.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It has always been illegal.  It\\'s only the last couple of weeks that we\\'re going to get sponsorship from the minister of the sports.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everything is changing.  It\\'s entirely possible that soon you\\'ll be able to order any part, any car, any car in the world. You can have it tomorrow.  What would it be?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Corvette.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Corvette.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Corvette.  Which year?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING SPANISH)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Today!\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a lunar picnic.  It\\'s only to be seen at night.  The grills are painted with this fluorescent painting. It\\'s very surrealistic.  It\\'s a weird sensation.  It\\'s like, make you hungry somehow.       BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Along with his creative partner Marco\\n\\nCastillo, Dago Rodriguez is half of Los Carpinteros, an artistic entity whose work is shown and collected all over the world.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Every single (INAUDIBLE) is a different thing.  We have different technology to fabricate and to develop.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Los Carpinteros have managed to stay in the government\\'s good graces by widely using irony to make their points. In the brutally competitive and capricious contemporary art world outside of Cuba, they are stars.  They make a lot of money.  But they always return home to Havana.\\n\\n(on camera):  Ah, looks like we\\'ll be eating well.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Tonight it\\'s a party in Dago\\'s backyard.  Kelvis Ochoa (ph) has made his much-loved pig\\'s head soup, with pumpkin, corn, peppers, and sweet potatoes, casaba, and plantain.\\n\\n(on camera):  If I saw somebody\\'s house, it was just an ordinary home, but they created their own fast food franchise, they made it look as if it was part of a chain, it was like, you know, Mr. Burger or something like this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This place can be a (INAUDIBLE) for fast food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I hope they don\\'t come here soon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, well, this is my biggest fear is that there will be a big glass box of a W Hotel, and start seeing Starbucks and Victoria\\'s Secret, and, you know, all the people who make every place look the same.  It would be awful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, but we have a 50-year lack of money.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a big problem.  The people will freak out with money when they have the money here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of course.  But, I mean, I think if there\\'s a $200 million hotel project that\\'s sustainable, that preserves the facade of the city, that will get approved first before anything super American per se, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa, what\\'s he cooking over there?\\n\\n(voice-over):  Can\\'t forget the whole roasted pig, a few years back, a pretty unthinkable luxury for just about everybody.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh, wow, soup.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everything is (INAUDIBLE).  They have no money.  They have no money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, for -- yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  None of the pesticides and the hormones yet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ooh, wow.\\n\\n(voice-over):  And tamales steamed in the broth from the pig\\'s head soup.\\n\\n(on camera):  Life is good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, it is.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that our culture is so strong that it\\'s going to take a lot of tourists and a lot of boats -- how do you say?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cruise ships.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cruise ships.  It\\'s going to take a lot of cruise ships to dissolve this (INAUDIBLE).  We\\'re always like this with or without tourists.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a typical street of this neighborhood.  Houses of wood, houses of concrete.  The street is not in good condition.  Here was the bus station.  It\\'s not a bus station anymore.  Now it\\'s a building.  It\\'s a monument of the past.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Montea (ph) is a suburb of Havana, home to one of Cuba\\'s most celebrated writers.\\n\\nLEONARDO PADURA, AUTHOR (through translator):  My name is Leonardo Padura, I am a writer.  And we are in the house where I have lived my whole life.\\n\\nThere are a lot of lines in the Cuban reality that apparently cannot be trespassed.  But I think they can be crossed, or at least they can be pushed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Author of the internationally successful Mario Conde detective series, Padura has been able to portray the daily struggles, the absurdities of life in Cuba.  It\\'s a delicate dance, and few have been able to replicate it.\\n\\n(on camera):  Your hero in the books, does he live in this neighborhood or another neighborhood?\\n\\nPADURA:  More or less.  More or less.       (on camera):  Happy place to grow up, this neighborhood?\\n\\nPADURA:  Yes, yes, yes.  Totally free.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I notice a lot of people just hanging out.  Who lives here?\\n\\nPADURA:  All kinds of people.  Doctors, for example, engineers, workers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING SPANISH)\\n\\nPADURA:  And people who make nothing, like that guy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPADURA:  He don\\'t make nothing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How does he live?\\n\\nPADURA:  Trying to find something to do or something to sell. Making a small business.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Cafeteria a la BBQ is only one example of a booming do-it-yourself service industry.  It\\'s a place where you get a lot of bang for your money.  Nothing fancy.  Just delicious.  Fried pork, plantains.  And the kind of silky, deeply satisfying beans that dreams are made of.\\n\\n(on camera):  This is good, good beans.\\n\\nPADURA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve never had a book blacklisted or banned in Cuba?\\n\\nPADURA:  No.  Fortunately, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you been able to say everything that you wanted to say?\\n\\nPADURA:  I try to be the most honest writer that I can be, and I think that I say all that I can say.  The problem is that we need in Cuba a lot of money, because it\\'s a very beautiful city, but the people have many problems to live, with the space, with the structure of the buildings.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  For dessert.\\n\\n(on camera):  Awesome.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Flan, cooked in a cut down beer can.\\n\\n(on camera):  Thank you.\\n\\nYou\\'re a successful author.  You\\'ve been around the world, you\\'ve traveled?      PADURA:  Mm-hmm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  During difficult periods of Cuban history, I\\'m sure you had many opportunities to live in Miami or Barcelona or Los Angeles.  And yet you stayed in the same house, the same neighborhood. Why?\\n\\nPADURA:  Because I like it.  I need to live in Cuba, near to the Cuban people, near to the Cuban language.  For me, it\\'s very, very important.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Yes, the future is here.  But the past, too, is everywhere.  The buildings, the cars, the gears of the whole system are still largely stuck in time.\\n\\nJUANA BACALLAO, SINGER (through translator):  My name is Juana Bacallao.  Juana la Cubana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ninety-three-year-old Juana Bacallao is very much a part of that past.\\n\\nBACALLAO:  I have dedicated myself to my art, to singing for the people my entire life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Long before the revolution, she was a shining star at the Meyer Lansky\\'s Tropicana, singing for Capone, Luciano, you know the names.\\n\\nBACALLAO:  Always \"Juana! Juana!\" when I try to get into my car. And that is the life I have always known with the people.\\n\\nI go on stage every day at midnight, with my orchestra.\\n\\nCuba has always been divine.  It is a wonderful fountain of friends.  All the people love me.  As long as there is light I will sing.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Cuba is not Havana.  It\\'s a bigger country than you might imagine, and the road to Santiago de Cuba, the country\\'s second-largest city, takes you 12 hours on their less-than- modern highway system.\\n\\nAlong the way, you see agrarian Cuba, the country in which most Cubans lived pre-revolution.\\n\\nSantiago is a poorer city.  It\\'s blacker.  And unlike Havana, the symbols and faces of the revolution still seem to mean something.\\n\\nThese Brutalist prefab workers\\' housing complexes are everywhere here, and at first glance, hell, at second glance, they look like something you would house animals in.  But for many previously living even poorer, harsher lives in the countryside, these offered something new.  Each group of buildings came with a doctor, a school.\\n\\nStill, they look about as grim as grim can be.  Yet, Santiago is anything but grim.  Siboney Beach is where locals go on the weekend to kick back with family, drink the best rum in Cuba, which means the best rum anywhere, swim, hang with family and friends.\\n\\n(on camera):  Hola, gentlemen, we will be needing some bassos (ph).\\n\\n(voice-over):  Ranel (ph) is our local fixer.  Ruben (ph) is in the bar business.  Sergio (ph) rents rooms to the occasional tourist, everybody getting by, making the adjustment to private enterprise Cuba in their own way.\\n\\n(on camera):  Until a few years ago, you couldn\\'t rent or sell, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  No.  It was different. Years ago you could rent...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A long time ago was allowed to rent house but no sell and buy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What kind of fish is this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dorado.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s huge.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Fresh-caught dorado and lobster is on the menu.\\n\\n(on camera):  Do they think this is going to change?  I mean, look, we\\'ve all been following the news.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We will have a tourism that we\\'ve never had before.  North American tourists.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Half an hour away.  I mean, they can basically take a boat over for lunch.  What do you think Americans want?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They have no idea, because they have never talked to an American tourist before.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Looking good now, man.  Good rum, cold beer, good fish, good lobster.  You\\'ll be needing a blender for pina coladas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If they have no machine, they\\'re going to do it by hand.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let me put it this way, my friend, you\\'re going to be making a lot of pina coladas.  I think you\\'re going to need the machine.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Night time is party time, where everybody, it appears, at least from when I was there, hit the streets.  Mom, dad, sis, even grandma get, well, crazy.\\n\\nIt used to be son and trova that ruled the streets.  This was where those musical styles were born, after all.  But now it\\'s reggaeton and, of course, hip hop.\\n\\nAlain Garcia (ph) is the leader of the Santiago-based hip hop trio TNT la Resistencia.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'ve been making hip hop for 15 years, which is quite difficult here in Cuba.  We\\'ve been in jail three days once just for make hip hop.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely it\\'s a change in Cuba, but I don\\'t think it\\'s because the relations with the United States are getting better.  It\\'s because the people just realize we need change.  We still want a kind of society where every participates, everyone is determining the future of our society.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  so born and bred in Santiago, where the good rum comes from?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So tell me, music business in Santiago, but what are you doing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Music here is more important than a plate of food for people.  When it\\'s Carnival sometimes people doesn\\'t have money for proper food, but they\\'ve got money for like a jar of beer and just enjoying that beer in a place with music.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How much American hip hop do you get here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We get actually quite a lot.  It\\'s by friends.  Someone came from outside, then was passed to me and then passed to my friends, and that\\'s it.  It\\'s hand by hand.\\n\\nIn the beginnings, in the \\'90s, we start to make hip hot here, and we get a lot of problems.  People came from the States, they are like the everlasting enemy of the revolution, so you are making the music, a protest music.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we have been a couple times in jail just for songs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So now you can make money performing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can maybe make money selling?      UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  CDs in the streets, but actually right now,\\n\\nmore possibilities are common.  We have the opportunity to like promote the music.  We have the opportunity to having access to Internet, free access, I mean.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s going to be the biggest thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  If you want to spend your holidays proper in Cuba, just come to Santiago.  I\\'ve got a couple of things to show to you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers, man.  To Santiago.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hola.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hola.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s do it.\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Tony.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hi, my name is George (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long you have been driving a taxi?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For more than 20 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For mostly Cubans or tourists?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, tourists, most of them Spanish, Italian, even people from Canada, a lot of Canadian people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You from Santiago?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was born in Santiago.  I was (INAUDIBLE).  I used to live in Russia for (INAUDIBLE).  I started there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was really young (ph).  And I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes?  Because it\\'s supposed to be cold there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can you imagine the difference, Cuba, Russia, snow?   The first time I saw, I sent to my mom a lot of pictures of holding snow, throwing snow.       (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what were you studying in Russia?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mechanical engineering.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you went from engineering to taxi driving?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.  In 1990s, the Russians left us alone.  We got in trouble with the economy, so I have to change my job.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it looks like the embargo might end, you know, a lot of money going to start coming to Cuba.  Do you think it\\'s going to change?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that the American businessmen will invest in Cuba, and that will be good for everyone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How about going back to engineering?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, that will depend on how much it would pay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right, OK.\\n\\n(voice-over):  What next for Cuba?  Something is coming.  It will come from out there, but also from within Cuba.  It\\'s already happening, but what is it?  Everybody knows, everybody can feel it, it smells like freedom, but will it be victory?\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  I am so confused.  It wasn\\'t supposed to be like this.  Of all of the places, of all the countries, all the years of traveling, it\\'s here in Iran that I am greeted most warmly by total strangers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ala (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The other stuff is there, the Iran we\\'ve read about, heard about, seen in the news.  But this -- this I wasn\\'t prepared for.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing):  I took a walk through this beautiful world felt the cool rain on my shoulder, found something good in this beautiful world.  I felt the rain getting colder.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  Merci.  Good to be here finally.  It\\'s taken some time.  Like a lot of time.  Like four years I\\'ve been trying. Finally.\\n\\nTehran.  City of nearly 8 million people.  Capital of Iran. (INAUDIBLE) unlike, there are neighborhoods of Rome this feels a lot like.\\n\\nAfter all of this time I finally have my chance to see a country I\\'d heard so much about.\\n\\n(on camera):  The weather is nice, too.  I don\\'t know what I was expecting.  But it is nice.\\n\\n(voice over):  A big blank spot on nearly every traveler\\'s resume.\\n\\n(on camera):  Merci.  Delicious.  Thank you.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD:  Once upon a time there was an ancient kingdom where they found a lot of magical black stuff under the ground.\\n\\nBut two other kingdoms had the key to the magical black stuff.  And when they wouldn\\'t share.  The people of the ancient kingdom got mad. They voted and their leader said the magical black stuff is ours to keep.  But the other kingdoms wear afraid of losing all of the magical black stuff so they gave money to some bad men to get rid of the leader.  They put back in power another leader.  And they gave him money too.  To some he was a good king.  But to others he could be very cruel.   After many years the people of the kingdom got mad. This time even madder.  So they scared the king away forever.  And then things started to get really messed up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  That\\'s a simplistic, and incomplete way to sum up the last 100-odd years of Iranian history.  But the point is there were a lot of issues and differing agendas leading up to the explosion of rage known as the Iranian hostage crisis.  Look, we know what Iran the government does.  George W. Bush famously called them part of the axis of evil.  Their proxies in Iraq have done American soldiers real harm. There was no doubt of this.  But I hope I can be forgiven for finding these undeniable truths hard to reconcile with how we are treated on the streets everywhere we go.  So forget about the politics if you can for a moment.  How about the food?  The food here is amazing.\\n\\nChelo-kabob, as close as you get to a national dish and the king of kabobs.  Ground lamb with spices, a good place to start.\\n\\n(on camera):  So what do you guys do for a living?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I export nuts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am a curator of contemporary art.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is an exploding scene here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Iranian culture has three different culture. Western culture, Iranian and Islamic culture.  It\\'s really (INAUDIBLE).  It has changed a lot during the last decade.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So this is the actual (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would recommend you to try this one.  And this one.  And this one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why not?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Chelo-kabob wouldn\\'t be complete without Persian rice.  Fluffy, long grained, and perfectly seasoned with saffron, the rice in this country us like anything you have ever had.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, Tony, first you should take the butter and put it on your rice.  Bon appetite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Bon appetite.\\n\\nIt\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s good.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(voice over):  It was a hopeful time when I arrived in Iran.  A window had opened.  There had been a slight loosening of restrictions since the election of President Hassan Rouhani.  And there was optimism for a deal that could lead to an easing of crippling economic sanctions imposed because of Iran\\'s continued nuclear program.  Trade restrictions that have been very, very difficult for everyone.  But there is a push happening between opposing factions in the government. On one hand, Iranians are the descendants of ancient Persia.  And empire of poetry.  Flowers, the highly influential culture that goes back thousands of years.  But the ruling clerical and military class are at best ambivalent and at worst actively hostile to much of that tradition.  Severe religious based restrictions of speech, dress, behavior were ushered in by the rise of the ayatollah during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\\n\\nSo how does one have fun in Iran these days?  This is the line that is constantly being tested.  Alcohol is, of course, forbidden.  You can get away with listening to rock or rap.  Sort of.  Sometimes.  But you cannot yourself rock or be seen to visibly rock.  Not everyone in Iran is delighted with what their country has become since the revolution. But even insinuating discontent can have consequences.  Protesters, dissidents, journalists have been simply disappeared into the moor (ph) of the national security system.\\n\\nLOCAL CREW:  Military.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What?\\n\\nLOCAL CREW:  Some military place.  Don\\'t shoot, please.\\n\\nLOCAL CREW:  These are (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nJASON REZAIAN, WASHINGTON POST CORRESPONDENT:  We are in this northern most land of Tehran, up here in Derbend (ph), the road stops and it gets really steep.  The place for Iranians to escape the heat, escape the pollution.  And have a kabob.  And a shisha, and just kind of unwind.\\n\\nAs print journalists our job is difficult, but it\\'s also kind of easy. Because there is so much to write about.  You know it, the difficult part is convincing people on the other side of the world that what we are telling you, we are seeing in front of our eyes is actually there. When you walk down the street you see a different side of things. People are proud.  The culture is vibrant.  People have a lot to say.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Jason Rezaian is \"the Washington Post\" correspondent for Iran, Yeganeh, his wife and a fellow journalist works for the UAE based newspaper \"The National.\"  Jason is Iranian- American.  Yeganeh is a full Iranian citizen.  This is their city, Tehran.\\n\\n(on camera):  The official attitude towards fun in general seems to be an ever-shifting -- is fun even a good idea? REZAIAN:  A lot of push and pull.  A lot of give and take.  When I\\n\\nfirst started coming here you wouldn\\'t hear pop music in a restaurant or ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  It\\'s everywhere now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now it is everywhere.\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  We have police.  They arrest girls or women for having bad hijab, or not being covered enough.  But it\\'s not that we live with the police in our head, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, one of the first things that people will say when you say, I\\'m going to Iran.  Yeah, but don\\'t they make women dupe this, this, this, this.\\n\\nREZAIAN:  Actually -- not so much, not as much as our friends.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Compare and contrast, women aren\\'t allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  That\\'s right.  Or vote.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or vote.  You can drive.  You can vote?\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  Yeah, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Can you open business?\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  Of course.\\n\\nMy sister is an accountant.  She has her own company.  Girls are allowed to do almost everything, except if you want to go and watch football, which is ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Can\\'t they watch football?\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  We cannot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Women\\'s issues are often at the spear point of change or possible change here.  On one hand, prevailing conservative attitudes demand certain things.  On the other hand, Iranian women are famously assertive, opinionated.  It\\'s a striking difference from almost everywhere else in the region.\\n\\n(on camera):  So, why are we so friendly with the Saudis again?\\n\\n:  It\\'s a great question.  It\\'s a really good question.\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  And I\\'m happy that you asked that question.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you like it?  Are you happy here? REZAIAN:  Look, I am at a point now after five years where -- I miss\\n\\ncertain things about home.  I miss my buddies.  I miss burritos.  I miss having certain beverages with my buddies and burritos.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREZAIAN:  Certain types of establishments.  But I love it.  I love it -- and I hate it.  You know.  But it\\'s home.  It\\'s become home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you optimistic about the future?\\n\\nYEGANEH SALEHI:  Yeah.  Especially, if there is no (INAUDIBLR) finally happens.  Yeah.  Very much, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Despite the hopeful nature of our conversation, six weeks after the filming of this episode, Jason and Yeganeh were mysteriously arrested and detained by the police.  Sadly in Iran, this sort of thing is not an isolated incident.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is OK to film in Iran and what is not?  What is OK to the friendly, to us, at least, Ministry of Guidance, might not be OK at all for the Basij, essentially, roving young religious militias. Despite all permits and paperwork being in order we are detained for several hours.  This sort of harassment is a daily part of life for Iranians.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just turn it off right now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I\\'m so glad to be here.  I like your fellow ...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sebastian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nPeople have been ridiculously nice to us.  Aren\\'t you guys supposed to be the axis of evil?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are absolutely right.  We are demonized by the media outside.  You show black and white.  People are demonstrating, and killing, and bombing.  And this and that.  And you never see - this and that.  But you never talk about the real people.  Who are actually living peacefully inside the country?  You know?  And eventually in the future of the world.  We and Americans have a very special place in this, you cannot play a game without considering Iran as a friend.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  One of Ferog\\'s (ph) many passions is ancient Persia, culinary history in particular, and he is writing a book on the subject.\\n\\n(on camera):  How do you pronounce the specialty here?  Vizi (ph)?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Service called Dizi (ph), which actually is the name of the pot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s right.  It\\'s like an Earthenware.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is one of the ending dishes of humankind.  It goes back to Mesopotamia 6,000 years ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Potato, chick peas, water.  Lamb.  Cooked together.\\n\\n(voice over):  Add a little fat.  Mash it up with potatoes and chick peas.\\n\\n(on camera):  That\\'s good.  What do Iranians want to eat today?  It is a home cooking culture.  I mean ...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  We didn\\'t have the culture of eating out. This is a culture of secret foods in the House.  Things, which are unheard of.  It\\'s not in the book.  Secret.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is really, really interesting.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A lot of secrets.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Have you ever tried traditional Iranian food?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is difficult.  Because everybody says the great food of Iran is cooked in people\\'s homes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  This is a land of secret recipes.  Passed down within families like treasured possessions.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. Tony, please.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Beautiful spread of food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She is my wife.  And I am a really lucky man.  She is very good to cook.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Prijan (ph) like so many other Iranians I\\'ve met has been kind enough to invite me to his home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is milk soup.  Milk and chicken soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It is really good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  My mom said that Iranian people loves guests.  And they will never get tired if the guest likes their food.\\n\\nHe\\'s called it fesanjan (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  A stew of fried chicken, onion, ground walnuts, pomegranate, and tomato paste.\\n\\n(on camera):  And this fruit.  There\\'s some kind of fruit.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, there\\'s the dried apricot inside (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Delicious.  So good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Needed around 24 hours\\' time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  These are very sophisticated, very time consuming dishes to prepare.  Always from scratch and always in excess of what you could possibly need.  You tend to kill your guests with kindness around here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Pinopina (ph).  That dish is from the south of Iran.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  From the Persian Gulf?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This one is from the north.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mahia halva (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Maybe if I could try some?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This one?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Of course.\\n\\nAnd that one is peyme (ph).  We made it with beans, meat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s so good.\\n\\nMm, fantastic food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Men and wife, both of them working.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s hard to do something like this.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I\\'ve been waiting.  That\\'s the crispy rice at the bottom right there.  What is it called?  Tareq?  Is that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tariq.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tariq.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Merci.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My mom and my mother-in-law, they think if they have a guest they have to at least two or three kind of foods.  And if they make just one they think that it is not very polite for a guest. But now they set the example for my generation.  That I have a guest I will just make one food.  One appetizer.  And one dessert.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know why?  You know why?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because it is much easier.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Times have changed.  Pre-1979 Tehran was party central. But with Iran\\'s 1979 revolution, 2500 years of monarchy was over.  The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini\\'s word became more or less -- law. Today hundreds of thousands of Iranians are bussed to his enormous shrine from all over the country.  The national holiday, Khomeini died on this day in 1989.  His funeral attended by over 10 million Iranians.\\n\\nCROWD (chanting)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nCROWD (chanting)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Down with ignorance.  Viva wisdom!\\n\\nCROWD (chanting)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of Iranian (INAUDIBLE) we need (INAUDIBLE), and maybe - in all of the world for friendship.\\n\\nCROWD (chanting)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t want to miss the bus.\\n\\n(voice over):  South of Tehran, the landscape opens up.  Only 300 miles of Iranian highway stretching to the city of Isfahan.  Isfahan is Iran\\'s third largest city.  Half the world, is the saying, went back when this was the capital of Persia and beyond.\\n\\nThe city is renowned for its architecture, the grandest bridges and mosques dating back to the Middle Ages.  The USA?  From America. Where are you from?  From Isfahan?  Or from Tehran?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tehran.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, nice to meet you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Hello.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to Iran.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to Isfahan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you so much.\\n\\nIt\\'s very beautiful.\\n\\nI guess into the decor, this is a former wrestlers\\' hangout?\\n\\n(voice over):  Tucked deep in the labyrinth of Isfahan\\'s bazaar, the smell of something, very, very good.  This shop has been here doing the same thing for 100 years.  And based on the line it must be doing it right.\\n\\n(on camera):  I have had biryani in India.  I\\'ve had it in Uzbekistan. But there is no question who invented biryani. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  No way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Biryani.  Maybe you know the word, though this doesn\\'t look like any biryani I have ever had.  Minced lamb shoulder, onion, turmeric, cinnamon, mint, and of course, saffron.  More valuable than gold by weight.\\n\\n(on camera):  This is delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Isfahan today one of the most visited areas by tourists?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, everybody knows, if you come to Iran and you don\\'t visit Isfahan, you are wasting your time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  The royal mosques, it\\'s Imam Square, the second largest square in the world behind Tiananmen in China.  At dusk families come to the square to cool off, picnic, and have, yes, it looks like even a little bit of fun.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Morning prayer in Isfahan.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (chanting in foreign language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Across town the Khaju Bridge where men gather spontaneously to sing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this OK?  This impromptu giving oneself over to the creative urge to stand and sing out to no one in particular?  Maybe, but not OK apparently to film.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gotta go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Got to go. BOURDAIN:  The road back to Tehran.  Along the way, reminders of just how far back this culture goes.  The ruins of ancient caravanserais, highway rest stops from when armies, merchants, traders traveling by camel by foot all passed along these same routes.  This right here a stop on what was once the Silk Road extending all the way to China.\\n\\nIn this part of the world, whatever your background, bread is a vital, essential, fundamental and deeply respected staple.  In mornings in Tehran countless bakeries like this one turn out as much as they can.\\n\\n(on camera):  It smells good in here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have to stay in line.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No problem.\\n\\n(voice over):  Standing in line is a daily part of life for many Iranians.\\n\\n(on camera):  They bake these things on small stones.  Gives it that texture.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is why it is called sangak - Sang is stone, pebble.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  In the years since the 1979 revolution, Iranians have weathered wars, food shortages, and crippling trade sanctions, that have caused the economy to sputter.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So I am going to make you a small table, all right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Movak (ph) is kind enough to take me for breakfast.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is called (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Awesome.  And it is made from bulgur wheat?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nAnd you know what is inside except wheat?  It is meat.  It is turkey. This is a mixture of sugar and cinnamon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you like?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, and the spread is amazing.\\n\\nSo, you were how old when the war with Iraq started?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was exactly seven.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Iraq attacked ...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. BOURDAIN:  And it was a surprise attack.\\n\\n(voice over):  Iran\\'s eight year long war with Saddam Hussein\\'s Iraq is deeply, deeply felt.  Hundreds of thousands of Iranians, many of them children died fighting in that conflict.\\n\\n(on camera):  Were you afraid?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We were afraid.  My brother was -- in the front. For three years out of eight.  And it was not only my brother, many young people like him.  Eight years of war, you know.  With a country that is supported by many big powers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  And it is worth mentioning whatever you think, wherever we are now, that Saddam supported by the U.S. government and with our full knowledge used Sarin and mustard gas on hundreds of thousands of Iranians.  Less known in America, known and felt by everyone in Iran.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And it was a mistake of the United States at the time.  They made a bad memory for Iranians.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  But still people are indeed really, really nice here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because people here don\\'t hate Americans.  You had a coup.  And then a revolution everything.  And then you captured the embassy.  And he is finished.  And then - killed each other.  We didn\\'t have a real fight.  So it can be some political misunderstanding which is resolved, which will be resolved, maybe, I hope.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Inshallah (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Inshallah.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  So far, Iran does not look and does not feel the way I had expected.  Neither East nor West, but always somewhere in the middle.\\n\\n(on camera):  Well it looks spectacular.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can\\'t have this in the restaurant.  It is time consuming.  It is very expensive.  So you have to - Persian cuisine has to be experienced in somebody\\'s home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So this one here is called basvurmah (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s slow cooked lamb in yogurt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In yogurt, and saffron and egg yolks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Nazilla (ph), a prominent art gallery owner insisted I come over for lunch with her friends and family.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And here we have the sour cherry rice.  The maples and chicken.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sour cherries.  More than any other nation, I think we love sour.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Rahim (ph), the cook, has been with the family for generations.  Rice mixed with yogurt and saffron baked into a crispy dough.  Don\\'t think of rice as a side dish around here.  It can be the main event.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Very, very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You put far more on the -- table than anyone can conceivably eat.  Is that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you don\\'t like your guest you don\\'t put anything.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And here we have kuftah (ph), which is a large meatball.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Kuftah tamrisi (ph):  Ground beef, onion, and cooked rice.  Walnuts, dried apricots, boiled egg and barberries.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anyway, we are a very interesting nation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  And very confusing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Extremely confusing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The contradictions are just.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Enormous.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Enormous.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Iranians we take you to our house, and we take you to our hearts.  And now - and in that way we are extreme.  You know, we are extremists in so many ways.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You see this tortured relationship between America and Iran for many years.  How do you think most Americans will react when they see this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They will start coming.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is very important for as Iranians to get sure - to make sure that we are seen as humans here, not the so-called enemy or the darkness of Iran.  You know, like you go to anybody\\'s house in Iran, and I am sure they will welcome you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The axis of evil.  We are not the axis of evil. Just normal evil like everybody else.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ten years ago Iran was, people they had hope for future, young people.  They wanted to travel.  They had a little bit of money.  But because of sanctions.  This sanction really squeeze everybody.  Eight years, no foreign investment here.  And so it was very difficult time.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Terrible.  Terrible.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And, in the population is really young.  70 percent are under 35.  And the thing is, they do - much more than what they have now.  They want to have good job, they want to - you know, have families, but is not possible now for them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I hope we can have more faith in the ordinary Americans, because every little change in the policy of the Western country, it really, really affects our lives here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Milad Tower.  Iran\\'s tallest building and the symbol of national pride.  It rises 1,000 feet in the air and looks out at all Tehran and beyond.\\n\\nWe were out on the observation deck taking it all in, trying to make some sense of it all.  Our time in Iran was coming to an end and it was impossible to say, was a window opening?  Or was it only a moment in time before it shut again?\\n\\nYou learn pretty quickly that in Iran, there is plenty of gray area. An undefined territory.  Where is the line?  It seems to change with barely a moment\\'s notice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Here it comes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This isn\\'t the first time that we have experienced such thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stay away from the glass.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Please follow me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Please stop filming.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Last day in Iraq.  Night falls, and the kids, like kids anywhere, get in their rides and head for somewhere they can hang out.\\n\\n(on camera):  Amazing ...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  American classics here.  Where do you get them?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Old men.  Old people, yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  And then fix them up?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mustang?  Camaro.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Camaro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Firebird?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pontiac.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a perfect L.A. car right there.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this a car club or is this people just come?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We hang out this way.  These are our friends.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I call back for little delivery.\\n\\n(voice over):  One last thing everyone has been telling me I have to try.  Iranian take-out pizza.\\n\\n(on camera):  It comes with ketchup.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you think about Iranian pizza?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not bad.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not bad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We don\\'t put ketchup on pizza, though.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I love ketchup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  I could spend my youth, pretty much, doing this.  Hanging out in a parking lot?\\n\\n(on camera):  Let\\'s assume the worst.  Let\\'s assume that you cannot see any way to reconcile what you think of Iran with your own personal beliefs.  You just generally don\\'t approve.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think those are exactly the sort of places you should go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Totally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  See who we\\'re talking about and where we\\'re talking about here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s almost un-American not to go to those places.  You know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know that I can put it in any kind of perspective. I feel deeply conflicted.  Deeply confusing, exhilarating, heartbreaking, beautiful place.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  Exactly.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  American cars are crazy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  American cars are crazy and they\\'re fun.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All I can tell you is, Iran I\\'ve seen on TV and read about in the papers, it\\'s a much bigger picture.  Let\\'s put it this way. It\\'s complicated.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After ten weeks, Yeganeh was finally released.  But as I read these lines, Jason remains a prisoner.  His future, the reasons for their arrest, are still unknown.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One, two, three!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you, guys.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALES:  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ll see you.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  There\\'s no place else even remotely like it.  Everything great and all the world\\'s ills, all in one glorious, messed up magical maddening magnificent city.  Beirut.  It\\'s good to be back.\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Sea itself trembles.  The ground shakes beneath the wheels of our heavy metal thunder.  Back in Beirut, after all these years.  The first time I was here did not end well but it made no difference to me.  I love it here.  In spite of everything, I love it here.\\n\\nNice ride.  It\\'s a good way to see Beirut.\\n\\nRAMSEY SHORT:  This is very similar to that place we went to years ago, Baba (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSHORT:  This is Reddick(ph).  This is your, you know, traditional chicken sandwich shawarma.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Deep fry it broast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The broasted chicken was this guy\\'s idea, my British Lebanese friend born to be wild Ramsey Short who I met in the bad old days of 2006.  Apparently he\\'s in with the Lebanese chapter of the Harley Davidson group, or HOG for short.  So when you roll into some religiously conservative villages on these monster bikes and leather jackets what\\'s the reaction?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Two types.  Once we were pelted with rice from the balcony.  And they thought we were like a wedding or something really nice.  And the other extreme was stones like on the wheels like just get out of here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I wouldn\\'t throw stones at people on Harleys.  Whoa.  Look at this.\\n\\nSHORT:  Let\\'s dig in.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The food. BOURDAIN:  Get now to work.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  And this is a famous neighborhood of the city. This area, there was central during the civil war.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The sheer volume of fire that was poured into some of these buildings is absolutely unbelievable.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  So, many battles happened on the same place over...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Over and over and over and over again.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Over again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Clearly.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I notice this every time someone visiting the city they just point at that.  Look at that.  But you know, we don\\'t see them anymore.  And we just pass by them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beirut, seemingly the world in miniature.  18 religious sects recognized.  More than 2 million Christians, over a 1.5 million Shiites, a 1.5 million Sunni, nearly 500,000 Palestinians and now by some estimates as many as 2 million Syrians, all living and somehow getting along, kind of, in a country the size of Connecticut.\\n\\n[21:05:15] But along its borders the country has what you might call serious neighbor issues.  ISIS in Syria threatening to expand its so called caliphate into Lebanon.  ISIS in many ways is something we\\'ve never really seen before.  It\\'s really large, well-organized, well- equipped terrorist army.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Lebanon stayed Zebeck refugees are nearly two years now.  The country simply can\\'t take any more.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A quarter of Lebanon\\'s population is now Syrian. That is the equivalent to the U.S. taking in 83 million Syrians.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This could be spiraling and if you said the real fear is that violence across the border, these Syrians boiling out, spilling over into an already neighbor now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beirut struggles to put a lid on the simmering sectarian tensions.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The aftermath of that happening in Beirut as well some of the flashes that took place.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The exchange of gun fire is heated in Shia as two Palestinian brothers were shot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here block by block you see the scars from the 15 year Civil War that only ended in the \\'90s but also nightclubs, discos, beaches, bikinis where much of the Arab world comes to let their hair down.  It is an incongruous mix.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All these hiding within them fear that violence is the beginning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Burj el-Barajneh neighborhood has long been the home to principally Palestinian refugees but more recently it\\'s become a refuge for Syrians fleeing the barrel bombs of President al-Assad on one hand and the predations of ISIS on the other.\\n\\nThe camp saw heavy fighting, shelling and outright massacres during the religious conflict known as the Lebanese Civil war.  Everywhere you see posters representing a full menu of political factions and affiliations from al-Assad loyalists to the PLO to every flavor of extremist.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A victory for jihad of equity or martyrism.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you know of any other place in the region where all of these groups are co-existing within a confined space?\\n\\nNICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is stunning to be walking down the street with high knee short skirts and busting on some red wine flowing and then drive straight into an extraordinarily conservative down Shiite district.  That\\'s below our district.  He suspects the bomb by bought the West coast terrorist organization.  It is kind of mind blowing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I am not a geopolitical expert and as much time as I spent in this part of the world I spent nowhere near the amount of time this guy has, Nick Paton Walsh, CNN senior international correspondent.\\n\\nWALSH:  Most of the groups here are now more terrified of those some crazy Islamic radicals across the border in Syria than they ever have been of each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do we call this neighborhood, what is it?\\n\\nWALSH:  It\\'s now one of the Calgarian mixed refugee areas that Beirut has.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Close to 2 million people from Syria alone.\\n\\nWALSH:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a hell of a lot to be absorbed by a tiny little nation of what 4.5 million?\\n\\nWALSH:  Well it\\'s just loads of people.  Focus on many people with nowhere to go.  You see it in how cell phones don\\'t sometimes work the way they should.  He brought the sheer water at their home as hot bad infrastructure of this also district.  And she is a mount and is also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ll follow you.\\n\\nNAJEM, ENGLISH TEACHER :  OK.  Well the first time in the history, a Palestinian leads American.  That\\'s nice. WALSH:  Don\\'t let the neighbors know about that.\\n\\nNAJEM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In Syria, Mr. Najem was an English teacher.\\n\\n[21:10:02] Needless to say he had at one time a better life back there.\\n\\nNAJEM:  I came from Syria.  After the civil war started...\\n\\nWALSH:  Yeah.\\n\\nNAJEM:  ... there.  We all live in a house with many, many problems. Sectarian problems and we don\\'t want to add more problems for those people.  But what can we do?  We live here in this camp.  Imagine the situation here.  It is unbelievable.\\n\\nHe is married by the way and he has three kids.  And despite his wounds he works in an construction.  This family bought this wood in order to protect house from the rats.  These children need medical operation but this family can\\'t pay for those operations because they are expensive.  They are waiting for to do.  They wait for nothing. They wait for the help of God.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Straining under the weight of all of these unasked for guests the Lebanese government has begun making it very difficult for them.\\n\\nNAJEM:  He doesn\\'t work only because he doesn\\'t have an official residence so he can\\'t leave the camp.  Otherwise he will be arrested.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Being stopped at any of the city\\'s ubiquitous military check points could mean a one way ticket back to Syria, trapped, unable to work, they exist invisibly on the margins of society.\\n\\nNAJEM:  You know, who put those here.  This is military area.  You don\\'t want to get involved in any problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Syrian food?\\n\\nNAJEM:  This is Syrian.  It is called the seven countries.  It consists of many kinds of vegetables, seven kinds of food.  But this thing that\\'s in Syria, most of them are well-educated doctors, engineers, lawyers, teachers.\\n\\nWALSH:  But here now it\\'s the opposite, right?\\n\\nNAJEM:  Here in Lebanon even if you were a doctor or a lawyer or a teacher, you can work only in the camp.  We don\\'t know how to go, where to go, to go back to Syria.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No camel?\\n\\nNAJEM:  To cross the sea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nNAJEM:  Suppose that there is authority collect us and to throw us away to Syria.  What is going to happen?  We have no area in the world.  We have no place in this universe.  We belong to nowhere. Nowhere.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome at in Lebanon.  Hello.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:16:08]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once known as the Paris of the Middle East, Beirut still clings to its glamorous 1960\\'s image, a chic tourist destination where you can famously ski and go to the beach all in the same day.  Walking at corniche it\\'s easy to forget, for a moment anyway, what\\'s going on not far from here?\\n\\nMO, LOCAL SECURITY SPECIALIST:  All the people who live here it is of course safe preferred.  This is endless.  Someday outside their houses and this is one of their traditional places.  This is the way I lived all my life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mo is a local security specialist on assignment to keep well, me and my crew safe from harm.  He lives with his daughter, Lushra (ph) and his family in Ras, Beirut, a mixed neighborhood of Christians, Muslims and Jews.\\n\\nLittle oil in the middle it\\'s I recall, yes?\\n\\nMO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So good.  Very good fish.  I missed this country.  I really did.\\n\\nMO:  You have been here before?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is my third time.  My first time was 2006.  We came here, we had two perfect days and then the war broke out.  During my first trip here in 2006, Hezbollah guerillas killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others in a cross border raid.  In the 34- day war that followed, much of Beirut was heavily pounded by bombs and naval artilleries.\\n\\nI fell in love with the city.  Under the worst possible situation, you have this really extraordinary mix of religions and people.  How is that?  Why?  What\\'s so special about it? Why?\\n\\nMO:  Of course, somebody on Friday go to pray, somebody on Sunday go to pray.  But they go to the same restaurant and have the same food has the same drink.  They have the same tradition.\\n\\nLUSHRA, MO\\'S DAUGHTER:  There is no place better than Lebanon.  You have everything.  People are friendly.  Beautiful, fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is a Democracy here. MO:  Of course.  You have choice to sit down and talk.  I like this. I don\\'t like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what\\'s in look like now?\\n\\nMO:  You know, we looked like we are two months before 2006.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, that\\'s not good.\\n\\nMO:  Tension is a little bit high but the people, they are very happy, you know, we are very happy.  I go with my family outside.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was watching the news last night in the hotel, it is genuinely terrifying.\\n\\nMO:  This is Lebanon.  It\\'s raining today, tomorrow is sunny.  It\\'s happening all the time.  You\\'ll get used to it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You get used to it.  Are you concerned or optimistic?\\n\\nLOSHRA:  No, I\\'m optimistic.  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do your friends feel the same way?\\n\\nLOSHRA:  Not really.  Not all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really, your friends are less optimistic?\\n\\nLOSHRA:  Yeah.\\n\\nMO:  We have only one good neighbor that don\\'t affect us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nMO:  It helped us all the time, if were sick.  He brings the fish and we have fish.  And he never get upset from us.\\n\\n[21:26:24]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  I\\'m back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nWe are back in the hiz-ouse.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m there too.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  This is radio Beirut.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that quite, yes.  Yes, I think it is.  Ironic glasses, vintage clothing and neck beards.  It appears the Brooklyn strain has spread even to Beirut. TINO, SYRIAN FILIPINO RAPPER:  Radio Beirut.

Same way a broken clock is trusted to be right twice a day.\\n\\nTINO:  CNN changed their slogan from this is CNN to at least it\\'s not Fox news.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How is it possible this mix of religions and cultures?\\n\\nTINO:  You know, geographically how it is Beirut so tiny.  You got mountains, you got the Sea.  We\\'re surrounded and then there\\'s so many factions that you have to deal with everybody.\\n\\nI\\'m going tricky ham in this fit.

At radio Beirut it is like a really awesome place where there\\'s live bands playing all week long.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We created a platform for emcees to try their skills in front of people without the prejudice, without the judgments and although we do judge but we don\\'t make fun of them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lebanese free style legend Hussein, aka, AA, the preacher man.

I mean a lot of people doing well and all because call them well and which is it\\'s a traditional rhyming scheme where each is speak about their problems, about their beefs. It\\'s in our core to be poetic.  We are poetic.\\n\\nTINO:  I come from what the background where you have governments that are dictators and we can\\'t really voice anything.\\n\\nThese politicians can\\'t believe because they\\'re getting lit on.  So the slaughter on this moth is trying to keep the lit on.  Fresh is makes this wheel get the boost that lit off and were robbed, were robbed, were robbed.\\n\\nWe\\'re trying to find our own identity.  We don\\'t want to be like our ancestors always fighting each other.  Like these Christian, he\\'s Shia, I\\'m Syrian Sunni, that\\'s nothing.

It was dust.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why this neighborhood?\\n\\nHAFFA:  Because the people of this area 99 percent, they support Hezbollah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  As Israel buries its dead from a surprise is via missile strike at the radical Shiite group celebrates a victory.  The rhetorical both side is at a fever pitch right now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is the deadliest Hezbollah attack against the Israeli forces since the two sides went to war in 2006.\\n\\n[21:30:03]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hezbollah means the \"Party of God\".  They are a Shia military political organization lavishly supported by Iran.  The party is more powerful, more effective on the ground than the Lebanese Army. The United States officially designates them a terrorist organization.\\n\\nIn 1983, they did this, the U.S. embassy bombing.  And this, the Marine barracks at Beirut\\'s airport, 299 United States and French servicemen were killed.\\n\\nHAFFA:  All the people are Hezbollah.\\n\\nPlease put it down now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They are dangerous.  They are well funded.  And whatever else they may be, they are not stupid.\\n\\nHAFFA:  In 2006, I have two sisters they lost their house (ph). Hezbollah take care of them.  Here everybody support Hezbollah, even the people who are not religious for one reason, because they feel protected by them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My host\\'s support for Hezbollah, typical of Dahiyeh neighborhood in South Beirut, is staunch.\\n\\nHAFFA:  Before Hezbollah, Lebanese before they were always scared of Israel.  Now when you say, Israel, you say, ha, ha.  We don\\'t care.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In the early days Hezbollah used tactics that just about anyone would call a terrorism.  When is it permissible morally to use a car bomb or using civilian targets?\\n\\nHAFFA:  For me?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For you?\\n\\nHAFFA:  I\\'m against killing.  Against killing anybody, even Israel. This person who I\\'m going to kill, a car bomb or whatever, doesn\\'t he has family.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s the most important thing happening in the world today that needs to be resolved for things to be better?\\n\\nHAFFA:  ISIS.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ISIS is number one? HAFFA:  Number one.  They kill hundreds and thousands of Shiites. They are devils.  They are against everything like everything on the earth they are against.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Recently Hezbollah has become heavily involved in the war in Syria, in defense of the Assad regime.  Complicating matters and uncomfortably enough, they are probably the best organized, best- equipped, most serious obstacle to ISIS and al-Qaeda in the area.\\n\\nHAFFA:  Most of the villages in the East of Lebanon, they are Christian and they are Sunni.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nHAFFA:  If Hezbollah wasn\\'t there, it was no more Christian in that area.  This is the only reason they\\'re gone.  This is the only reason for just to protect my children and my wife.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  20 years, 30 years?\\n\\nHAFFA:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Will things be better?\\n\\nHAFFA:  I hope so.  Of that 20 years and 30 years, I hope now, next year, things goes I hope.  I hate war.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:37:31]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The last two times I\\'ve been here, there is just this never-ending building boom.  Nobody seems to be moving in but the buildings are going up. JOUMANA HADDAD, POET & CULTURE EDITOR, AN NAHAR:  Yeah. BOURDAIN:  Who is buying these apartments?  Who are they four? HADDAD:  Two kinds of people, Lebanese, who are living abroad, or Arabs, especially from the Gulf Region. BOURDAIN:  Right, for whom Beirut is a relatively liberal wonderland or permissiveness compared to Riyadh, for instance. HADDAD:  Compared to Riyadh, yes.  But, unfortunately, we cannot generalize this and say that Beirut is a place where sexual expression is encouraged. BOURDAIN:  Her books are banned in many countries in the region.  She is regularly threatened with rape, stoning and murder.  She is Joumana Haddad, culture editor of Lebanon\\'s biggest newspaper, \"An Nahar.\" HADDAD:  Yesterday, I had my first T.V. show about sexual freedom and you cannot imagine how many house doors have opened just because I dared say that girls are allowed in sexuality like boys.  And we pretend -- we pretend to be a democracy. This is Gufta (ph) BOURDAIN:  Gufta (ph)? HADDAD:  Yes, with yogurt sauce and cranberries. BOURDAIN:  That the fried.  Stuffed grape, please? HADDAD:  Yes. BOURDAIN:  The fact that Lebanon and Beirut, in particular, works at all.  If all of these religious groups have different interests, I mean, this is a fully functioning, more or less, by world standards. HADDAD:  Fully functioning? BOURDAIN:  Yeah, this is a... HADDAD:  We don\\'t have a president.  It\\'s been almost -- going to be a year now that we are without one. BOURDAIN:  It\\'s sort of awesome. HADDAD:  Don\\'t you think that the main reason behind you seeing this as a thrilling, exciting place to live in is that you\\'re a visitor and not someone who actually lives here? BOURDAIN:  Am I wrong to love this place? HADDAD:  You\\'re not wrong to love it.  I love living on the tip of a volcano, but there has to be some point where I can breathe and relax. I don\\'t want to seem like I\\'m only criticizing because I really also, as much as I hate this place, I love it as well.  And I know that it\\'s also very precious to have such a kind of freedom in a place in the Arab world like Beirut. I don\\'t need to tell you about Islamic State.  Even though they are not inside Beirut yet, we can feel the threat. [21:40:02] We can feel it every day. BOURDAIN:  Should people come here? HADDAD:  Yes, definitely.  They should come.  They will enjoy it as much as you have.  I wouldn\\'t advise them to stay more than a month, though.\\n\\nMICHEL ELEFTERIADES:  I often go to the Daniel events and I asked in that to call me your highness.  I love that.  That\\'s magic.  So I go there and I am dress like an emperor.  I\\'m not today but -- so sometimes I dress like an emperor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There have been two attempts on your life I guess?\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That you\\'re aware of.\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  Yes, two attempts.  In Arabic we say that (inaudible). It means that the third one succeeds.  So I don\\'t know when the third one will be.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re young militant and an activist, a labor organizer? You have been arrested in your life?\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  Yes, many times.  When I was 14 years old for example I became a communist in the Phrygian that was under control of the extreme right wing militia.  I ended up in a torture room that I declare to be it just behind you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Later after joining and then leaving the Lebanese army, Michel Elefteriades formed the NUR, an armed of revolutionary group.\\n\\nAnd yet here you are your life now is music and culture?\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  I think that I was made to be a musician but when war happened in Lebanon I took a gun.  I understood that I cannot face someone who\\'s attacking my house with the guitar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 2003, by now a music producer, entrepreneur, politician, artist, author and film maker, he founded the Beirut Musical in a bullet popped theater empty since the civil war.  This is his kingdom.\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  Some people come because it\\'s trendy.  They come with the sexy ladies.  Some come because they like to discover new things. We have per night up to 15 acts, each act coming from a different culture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who needs culture?\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  I think that culture can save the world.  ISIS towards these criminals who are not very far from Lebanon, someone who had interesting books, someone to listen to beautiful music cannot become an animal again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you were the emperor of the world, hypothetically.\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  Hopefully.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hopefully, what would Beirut be like in 10 years?\\n\\nELEFTERIADES:  Best case scenario it goes back to before the creation of separate when all communities were living very well.  The Jewish would be back.  We are -- the Jewish neighborhood here.  I think that we have all to be united to fight this monster, ISIS.  Once that the monster is defeated you can start arguing again about other things.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:48:27]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hello.\\n\\nROAN:  Hello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How you doing?  I\\'m Tony.\\n\\nROAN:  I\\'m Roan (ph), nice to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This feels very formal.\\n\\nROAN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But it\\'s not so please relax.\\n\\nROAN:  I am relaxed.  Can I get my beer?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By all means, yes please.\\n\\nROAN:  Lots of people come here.  They are mostly musicians and artist people.  Lots of jamming happens here and it\\'s like we\\'re a family hanging out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This cafe is a typical Beirut establishment but the clients tell from Lebanon, from Syria and any number of other countries.  The owners are both Lebanese and Syrian and acutely aware of the tricky political realities with which they must live. They were concerned about us filming here and wanted us to understand\\n\\nclearly that the cafe has no political affiliation and that the opinions of this young lady, Roan are not that of the cafe or necessarily even the clientele.\\n\\nYou were born and breed in Syria?\\n\\nROAN:  I was -- yes.  I was born and brought up in Syria, Damascus. One night, 3:00 a.m. the army entered our house and I found them in my bedroom looking for the free Syrian army.  My dad knew he couldn\\'t protect us because he was old.  Three hours later we decided to leave, so we came to Beirut.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, thank you.\\n\\nROAN:  We always eat here.  Grape leaves is my favorite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I saw you went for that first.\\n\\nROAN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s delicious.\\n\\nROAN:  Yeah it is.  We come here a lot and we talk a lot about Syria.\\n\\n[21:50:01] We talk about our visa issues most of the time.  Actually now I have four months left and I really have no idea what am I going to do?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think?  Will they renew your visa?\\n\\nROAN:  So far, I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do they arrest you?  Do they take you to the border or they take you over the other side?  What -- well, does that...\\n\\nROAN:  They send you back to Syria.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happens if you go back to Syria?\\n\\nROAN:  Most probably die on the way or some people get arrested or be taken into the army.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How different is Damascus from Beirut?\\n\\nROAN:  Oh, it\\'s really, really different.  In Damascus I was always afraid of the government.  Some people died because they cursed the president.  I left Syria and I found hope here and I screamed in the streets, cursing all politicians and everything.  It\\'s all right. Nobody\\'s going to come and arrest you.  I really love this place, with all my heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is all of the chaos and the violence worth it for change, is that worth dying for?  I mean, things were, there was order when you grew up.  There was order.\\n\\nROAN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No freedom, but order.  Would you go back to that?\\n\\nROAN:  I don\\'t think that there is anything worthy in the world of a human blood.  There is nothing more important than human being.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'d never be able to yell out loud.  You\\'ve never be able to do the things you\\'re doing now.

I\\'ve been well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We are better for capitalist imperialist pig dogs like Ramsey and myself to spend the last evening in Beirut than Abu Ely.\\n\\nSHORT:  It was opened by a guy called Naya.  He is a atheist member of the Lebanese, communist party.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A communist themed bar located in a housing block.\\n\\nWhat is this?\\n\\nSHORT:  You know what?  I\\'m not sure.  It\\'s been put in front of us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, we should probably drink it and figure it out.\\n\\nSHORT:  Yeah, let\\'s do it.  Why not?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Vodka.\\n\\nSHORT:  Vodka.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, actually I had somebody who lives here tell me, oh yeah, place is great.

There are pockets of weirdness, awesomeness, and then there\\'s Charleston, where for some time now important things have been happening with food.  A lot of them having to do with these guys.\\n\\nWhat are we drinking?  There are beer we\\'ve got harder stuff?  What\\'s going on?\\n\\nSEAN BROCK, EXECUTIVE CHEF, HUSK RESTAURANT:  I usually go with a Budweiser and a Jagermeister.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Budweiser and Jagermeister.  So any notion of going local right out the window.\\n\\nBROCK:  Two Jagers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now I know.  I know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, two Jagers.  Cheers.\\n\\nBROCK:  Cheers.  The first one\\'s never good.  The first one is never good.  But it gets easier after the first one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, look, this is not my first time to Charleston as you know.  I did do a show here before, and I\\'m still thinking in about it.  Apparently I really stop the first time I came here, because I made a number of errors.  Apparently, none more egregious than going out or like doing oyster roast and drinking champagne.\\n\\nBROCK:  I never heard of such a thing.  Well, champagne and beers is OK with the oysters.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  So you ask what -- it must have been a place off.\\n\\nBROCK:  And there so many got -- yet confused somewhere.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, anyway, I got it wrong.  This time I\\'m getting it right which is why I\\'ve come to you.\\n\\nYou can be forgiven for underestimating Sean Brock first time you meet him.  I know I did.  I saw a scruffy looking dude in a trucker cap who always seem to have a bottle of really good bourbon on hand.\\n\\nBROCK:  Start so well in 1991, 18 years old.  This is the end of great whiskey.  It didn\\'t come in this bottle.  This is my travel bottle, because it\\'s plastic, you see, so it don\\'t breaks when you get rowdy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It took me a little time to discover the ferocious intellect, the inquiring nature, the uniquely focus and purposeful talent to the man, without a doubt one of America\\'s most important chefs.  A guy who\\'s redefining what -- not just southern cooking is, was, and can be, but American cooking as a whole.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One, two, three!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re going to talk a lot about this over the next week about the notions of universal awesomeness.  Is the waffle house universally awesome?\\n\\nBROCK:  We have one choice for late-night eating and it\\'s the waffle house.  And they create this environment where no matter how blitzed you are or how normal you are, you are welcomed and treated equally with an experience.  It\\'s not just like, you know, eating a plate of food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re talking about all, the magical spiritual place.\\n\\nBROCK:  It\\'s beyond a magical, spiritual place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is indeed marvelous.  An irony free zone where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts for everybody regardless of race, creed, color, or degree of inebriation is welcomed.\\n\\n[2:05:11] It\\'s warm yellow glow, a beacon of hope and salvation inviting the hungry, the lost, the seriously hammered all across the south to come inside, a place of safety and nourishment.  It never closes.  It is always, always faithful, always there for you.\\n\\nBROCK:  When I was a kid, I was obsessed with this place because I wanted to be a chef.  And this is the only place that I\\'d ever been to right, I actually watched people cook.  Well this was actions to me. That would seem these people cooking at a pace and cooking for people who were completely out of control, but still providing hospitality. It was one of the things that really helped me fall in love with cooking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Waffle house.\\n\\nBROCK:  Yes and cook, cook, cook, cook.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I never really know about this.  I\\'m unbelievably in spite of my world travels, new to the wonders of the waffle house and unfamiliar with its ways.

BOURDAIN:  This, sausage gravy.\\n\\nBROCK:  You can\\'t go all in, if you want everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I know I need to make a choice.\\n\\nBROCK:  So there\\'s a balance.  And then when you find your balance, you memorize it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Help me.\\n\\nBROCK:  I go scattered covered smothered chunks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which means I gather scattered on the griddle, heaped with brown onions, cheese, and chunks of hickory smoked ham.\\n\\nBROCK:  That\\'s my style like, I\\'ve been doing that since day one.  And I didn\\'t even know what that means.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know what I know, I don\\'t want waffles at the waffle house.\\n\\nBROCK:  Bullshit men, you have to have...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Waffles?\\n\\nBROCK:  Ah OK.  You have to call in waffle.  Now so what I advice as...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nBROCK:  ...as a chef is it, a tasting menu experience where you can sit down and really experience what this place does.  And you start out first thing you have, pecan waffle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All right, gentlemen.\\n\\nBROCK:  Oh the pecan waffles.  Is crush it put (inaudible).

You come here expecting something amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is better than the French Laundry man.\\n\\nBROCK:  And then second course.  Patty melt, split.  Oh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Patty melt.\\n\\nBROCK:  Patty melt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh. BROCK:  Come on.  That\\'s not insanely delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh god damn.\\n\\nBROCK:  Not insanely delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No meal is complete without a sunny side up egg.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yeah.\\n\\nBROCK:  And then a green salad with some thousand island dressing would be amazing.  Would you rather have thin-cut pork chops or T- bone?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I would like both.\\n\\nBROCK:  Heinz 57 is the best, man.  One or more complex sauces in the American repertoire.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nBROCK:  Do you want to talk shit about it.  This is sauce work.  Trust me, this is going to change your life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now that\\'s wrong, man.  Come on.\\n\\nBROCK:  Mmm.  So is a brilliant human being got had a recipe, it was amazing and I think he got a bad rap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Seems like you\\'re talking about Ronald McDonald.  He had a good idea. You know, no, you\\'re wrong.  I\\'m sorry.  Here\\'s where we part ways, my friend.  Here\\'s my sauce.\\n\\nAfter a few bites of waffle, a burger, a hunk of generic T-bone and some hash browns, one feels drawn right to the center of what makes our country great.

Actually, the literal transition of the umami.\\n\\nBROCK:  Orgasm?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  Umami means in Japanese, literally it means, \"I will smock your, divide you in half.\"\\n\\n[21:10:07] That burger.\\n\\nBROCK:  You and you buy some pork chop.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody needs a place.

It\\'s very different up there and down here.  It\\'s a big transition, easy for you, or not?\\n\\nMURRAY:  It\\'s easy.  You know, I do driving was the real transition because I drive, like, in New York person and when you come here, driving like New York, you know.  It takes you a while to recover but, you know, I\\'m right on the edge here, like telling people that this is a really nice place to come and really I don\\'t want anyone else to come.  I like it the way it is.  There\\'s a lot of insects.  It\\'s really, really hot in the summer.  And the traffic is worse than it ever was.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Husk directly addresses southern culinary traditions using the best of modern techniques, but always, always respecting the originals and who made them.  It\\'s a pressing matter to redefine southern food.  If I were a southerner, I would, I would make it a personal mission because it was distorted for so long.  But as a northerner, why should northerners care?\\n\\nBROCK:  Well, I think if you look at the history of food in America. Well, there\\'s no denying that southern food was the first.  There true cuisine that had this foundation and that\\'s important to preserve and yeah, you know, to me both and it goes back to the idea.  It should be, you should be cooking and preserving and celebrating the food of your grandmother.\\n\\nMURRAY:  People take a real pride in their ability to cook my aunt\\'s recipe, my grandma\\'s recipe.  And this is how we made these.  And the standard of food here is so high that when I go around any place, I just go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Country ham, bread and butter pickles, and, of course, Sean being Sean, there will be burden.\\n\\nBROCK:  I was like to start a meal with pickles and ham.  I try not to geek out too much, but this is a very special breed of pig that came over here in the 1500s.  It\\'s called Ossabaw.  The Spaniards brought it.  It has a very particular flavor.  This one\\'s aged three years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s ridiculously good.  That\\'s the best American ham I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nBOCK:  No, thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By the way, that was unbelievable.\\n\\nBROCK:  These two things together, is my two favorite things in the whole entire world.  Spits in well in whiskey and old country ham.  So this is an old dish that I dug up in one of those old books that I study.  It\\'s an old-fashioned oyster pie.  So just grab your spoon and just dig all the way down.  The oysters are in the bottom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How old is this recipe?\\n\\nBROCK:  It was well-documented in the 19th century, pre-civil war.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good.\\n\\nMURRAY:  Is it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nBROCK:  So shrimp and grits is the dish of Charleston.  I mean, it really is.  It\\'s the dish I crave when I leave Charleston and come back.  This version is one of the older ones or we actually make hominy first by mixilizing (ph) the corn.  So you\\'ll taste a little, the grits are a little bit different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.  That\\'s really great looking.\\n\\nBROCK:  Then we make a brown gravy which is the most classic way and on top, crispy pig ears.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You got grannies coming in saying I haven\\'t tasted this since I was a little kid?\\n\\nBROCK:  Yeah, exactly, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, it\\'s good.\\n\\nBROCK:  We were trying to replicate the emotion of the southern food provides you in a time where good ingredients weren\\'t available.  So we\\'ve made up for tasteless ingredients by frying them or dumping butter on them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nBROCK:  Now we don\\'t have to.\\n\\nMURRAY:  Wow.  What\\'s going on here?  This is an onslaught of awesomeness here.\\n\\nBROCK:  We didn\\'t order this.  So it happens on so pit beans into the cooking over the fire all day.\\n\\n[21:20:00] These are the red peas that came grills Africa.  This is the original Carolina gold rice.  Hand harvested with any grilled whiting which is like nobody eats in Charleston in restaurants as everybody eats in home with some spring vegetables it in.  And the suckling pig at the same breed Ossabaw as we had earlier with the ham, mixed with them on mule foot, cooked on a spit some creamed corn and corn bread.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, well this is going to be my first mule foot.\\n\\nBROCK:  This is like my favorite way to eat, you know, just family- style, pass stuff around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.  The rice is amazing.\\n\\nBROCK:  It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yep.  You see Bubba Gump, do you get angry?\\n\\nBROCK:  I am very angry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For me, it\\'s Chili\\'s, because you see Chili\\'s along the Mexican border.  Like what the (inaudible)?  I said we have a shortage of Mexicans in this money, does it get shortage of good food?  You\\'re eating the chili\\'s?  I really want to like pull up the car, get a tire iron, and walk in and just straighten some people out.\\n\\nBROCK:  Clean house.  Road House style.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Road House.  Vastly under rated film.\\n\\nMURRAY:  You guys are both into Road House? BOURDAIN:  Such a great film.  So easy, what else do we need to know? You can deconstruct this film forever.  The more you watch it, the more mysteries unfold.\\n\\nMURRAY:  I\\'ve never seen anyone enjoy Road House more than I do.\\n\\nBROCK:  What?\\n\\nMURRAY:  My friend\\'s wife, Kelly Lynch, plays the doctor that stitches up Patrick Swayze in the movie.  She\\'s the romantic interest, right? The unattainable...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMURRAY:  ... romantic interest.  And I have for the last, I don\\'t know, probably about 25 years, called his home in the middle of the night and said, \"You don\\'t know me, but your wife\\'s getting slammed up against the wall by Patrick Swayze.  She\\'s not putting up much of a fight.\"  And then hang up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is in many ways a perfect film.\\n\\nBROCK:  It\\'s a whiskey talking.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:26:24]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is down home southern cooking?  Where did it come from?  Who\\'s responsible?  Well, it\\'s always useful when asking those kinds of questions wherever you are to ask, first, who did the cooking back then in the beginning?  Where did they come from?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you meet people here, you know that you\\'re seeing a direct descendant of a slave that was here after the slaves were freed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ashley Green (ph) grew up on Mosquito Beach on James Island in Charleston.  Her mother owns the property which has been in her family for generations.  Fact of the matter is, in the old south back when the dishes, flavors, and ingredients of southern cooking, which to say American cooking as opposed to European, chances are that food was grown, gathered, produced and prepared by African slaves.\\n\\nChef BJ Dennis has made it a personal mission to celebrate and protect the culinary traditions his ancestors passed down to him.\\n\\nBJ DENNIS, CHEF:  Well, this some local blue crab, just fresh and seasoned. This is a play on some garlic crabs, well this is shrimp butter instead of the garlic butter.  And then you have that play, you know, the french influence into the cuisine right here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The flavors and textures and food ways of West Africa are all over southern cooking.  And there are few better places to see how short the line between there and here than Gullah culture.  I\\'m really enjoying this.  I got to tell you. BROCK:  This is so delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, my god.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How African is traditional Gullah cooking?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, I think what happens is you change the location of the people but you did not change who the people were. You did not change the information that they came with, with their traditions.\\n\\nBROCK:  Now, if you look at the history of American food, now, you\\'ll quickly see that this is one of the first true cuisines of America.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, what\\'s that?  What is this?  This looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible) West Africa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All right.\\n\\n',\n",

One that many hoped would carry it into the European Union.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s clearly a significant portion of the Turkish population that\\'s not happy with the policies of the democratically elected government.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But things have changed.  They are changing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You get clashes erupting, demonstrators throwing rocks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And what happens next has implications far beyond Turkey.\\n\\nIt has been a turbulent year for Turkey.  And I arrived in Istanbul at the moment of a critical election.  The question on everyone\\'s mind is whether the current president and his ruling party will win a large enough majority to change the constitution, potentially allowing him to stay in power indefinitely.  These have been good times for some. Particularly in the construction and development business.  And fearful ones for others.  They are particularly concerned about what happens next, for instance, in the Kurdish parts of town.\\n\\nAMBER LYON, FORMER CNN REPORTER:  Our polls are opening.  Turkey\\'s voters choose a new parliament which could lead to big changes in the country\\'s political system.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The ruling justice and development party expected to take most of the seats.\\n\\nLYON:  But how much power the president actually has will be determined by the success or failure of the Kurdish party.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The HDP, originally a Kurdish political party, has sought to unite the disparate voices calling for change in response to 13 years of what has essentially been one-party rule by the AKP.  So history, whatever it might be, is about to happen.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just in the past hour, polls have closed in the country\\'s parliamentary elections.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Voters in Turkey have just shaken up the country\\'s political landscape in a major way.  They said no to placing Recep Tayyip Erdogan in push for more power over the constitution.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The ruling AKP Party did not win the majority its president had hoped for.  In fact, they lost seats in parliament and for the first time, the pro-Kurdish party gained enough votes to earn a real voice in the government.\\n\\n[21:05:55] ESRA YALCINALP:  We are at the very tip of Istanbul next to the Black Sea, so the ships that are going by here, they\\'re basically going to Russia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I meet an old friend, Esra, for my first meal back in the country.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  I know you like your fish with the head and tail.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do.  This is perfect.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  I ordered some raki.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That makes me so happy.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Yes, which is our national drink.  It\\'s aniseed and...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I am familiar with this, all too familiar.  Cheers.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Welcome back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So since I last saw you, which was in 2000...\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Nine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  2009.  Wow, a long time ago.  Istanbul looks a little different than the last time I was here.  It looks a little more like every other city.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Yeah.  Well, construction.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There seems to be a lot of that going on.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Your president likes to build stuff today.  He like the pour concrete.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  He keeps the economy going.  Turkey\\'s so much politicized since the last time you came.  Like after 2011, the daily life issues like how many children you should have, advising women not to laugh out loud in public, things like these were actually suggested by the government. BOURDAIN:  Right.  Do you think this is coming from genuine ideological religious place or is this some political calculation?\\n\\nYALCINALP:  I think it\\'s a genuine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re telling me that current leadership is, in his heart, is genuinely opposed to alcohol, women laughing in public?\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Maybe I don\\'t feel comfortable answering that question.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay.\\n\\nTurkey\\'s most famous politician, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he is the power and has been the power in one form or another for more than a decade. He\\'s the face of Turkey\\'s ruling justice and development party, the AKP.\\n\\nErdogan has in recent years made Islamist politics mainstream and while remaining very, very popular in this extremely polarized nation, cracked down hard on media, political opposition, free speech, and, of course, demonstrations.\\n\\nIn 2013, the almost revolution in Turkey happened.  A protest to contest the proposed demolition of Istanbul\\'s Gezi Park resulted in a brutal crackdown by the police.  In response, ordinary Turks unconnected by any particular ideology poured into the streets.  With the whole world watching on social media, they, too, were met with force.\\n\\nIn the end, Erdogan remained firmly in control and there were repercussions for many who had supported the protests.  From that point on, media, social media, even open discussion of issues or events became treated as hostile acts by foreign enemies.\\n\\nAutocrats in general are not famous for their sense of humor so it\\'s no surprise that comedians in Turkey like Deniz and her fiance, Khan (ph) walk a perilous lie.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are these good times to be a comedian in Turkey?\\n\\nKHAN:  It\\'s definitely one of the best times because our former prime minister, support for a living.\\n\\n[21:10:03] DENIZ:  We don\\'t use the names.  We just call him the greatness, you know.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE).\\n\\nKHAN:  I guess they are running the finals.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The finals.\\n\\nKHAN:  Yes. BOURDAIN:  All weight classes.  But it\\'s basically Greco-Roman\\n\\nwrestling.  Just you greased up.  As I understand you can\\'t choke with two hands, only one.\\n\\nKHAN:  Yeah.\\n\\nDENIZ:  Because you can just slip your hand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right down into some greasy ass crack.\\n\\nDENIZ:  And grab (ph) looks that\\'s fine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s OK.\\n\\nTell me something.  I want to know what are the rules of the game.\\n\\nTurkish oil wrestling.  A big freaking salad covered with oiled men in leather pants giving each other spirited and prolonged reach-arounds. Oh, geez.  Can we get rights to the Barry White greatest hits record or Diana Ross \"Love Hangover\" or is that too obvious?\\n\\nI like to be respectful of ancient tradition, but I mean the jokes write themselves.  What, there\\'s, like, ropes inside or handles? Where do I get a pair of those pants?  Those are some super freaky pants.\\n\\nDENIZ:  And do you see the golden belts?  Look good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well look, it\\'s got to be because the pants are awesome. Imagine what the belt looks like.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Does he stop yelling at some point?\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nKHAN:  The announcer is called (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nKHAN:  And in slang, (inaudible) means person who talks too much.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nKHAN:  It\\'s too loud.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nKHAN:  It\\'s time for political end.  Lots changed since your last visit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Obviously, the mood has changed a lot which is weird because everything seemed to be going so well.  Things seemed to be getting more tolerant.\\n\\nKHAN:  Tolerance level is so low these days.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nKHAN:  People taking sides, don\\'t like the other one.  These people don\\'t like our kind.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what happens if someone doesn\\'t like your joke? Somebody in a powerful position does not like your comedy.  What happens?\\n\\nDENIZ:  Depending on the degree how much he doesn\\'t like you, how much he\\'s offended.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s say he\\'s really offended.\\n\\nDENIZ:  You go to jail.  Or being, you know, terrorist or...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aiding and abetting the enemies of the state.\\n\\nDENIZ:  Yes.  Enemy of the state.  Being enemy of the state is most common thing you can do right now in Turkey.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nDENIZ:  They\\'re asking for more oil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More oil.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:17:01] BOURDAIN:  Building boom or building bubble.  Architect and city planner Murat Germen has been capturing Istanbul\\'s construction boom with his camera.  He employs a unique method of compressing panoramas to create a striking reimagining of cityscapes reflecting perhaps more of the reality than a straight photo could.\\n\\nMURAT GERMEN, CITY PLANNER:  I\\'ve been following what\\'s happening in Istanbul because it\\'s my hometown, and what\\'s happening is the new government is basing the supposedly booming economy totally on construction.  So what they did is they started to build high-rise housing, shopping malls, roads, and all that, but not necessarily buildings that are related to the making of culture.  So all this construction is related to consumption.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, are these spaces needed?  At whatever income level, will somebody be living in these buildings?\\n\\nGERMEN:  That\\'s a very good question.  I\\'m asking the same question.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.  First things first.\\n\\nGERMEN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ll save the world later. GERMEN:  This is the pita by the way and it\\'s like the Turkish version\\n\\nof pizza, let\\'s say.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pita has some similarities.  I mean, there\\'s cheese in it. Dough.  But it\\'s more like a calzone maybe.  I don\\'t know.  It\\'s an efficient delivery vehicle for this case ground meat, cheese, and onions a not so little torpedo straight from I was going to say flavor town, but no, that would be wrong.  I want to see what you do with this.  I want to see how you eat this.  What do you do with that -- you dip in the egg?  Pour it in?\\n\\nGERMEN:  Yeah, yeah pour yeah exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm.  This is...\\n\\nGERMEN:  Cholesterol bomb we call it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s a remarkable lack of sentimentality about really one of the most uniquely glorious looking spaces anywhere.  Why don\\'t they care?\\n\\nGERMEN:  I agree.  There\\'s a lack of sentimentality and there\\'s also a lack of vision, I believe, hometown vision.  We have very short-term visions.  Mostly based on money making.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When people look at the work you do see and do you stop them, what do you want them to see?\\n\\nGERMEN:  First of all, I really value the sustainability of our particular culture.  I want my work to show, hey look, this is what we had.  I think we are already losing it, so why don\\'t we stop here and maybe consider doing something else?\\n\\n[21:20:31] BOURDAIN:  (inaudible) Pazara, long home to tradesmen, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians.  Groups whose populations are these days a tiny fraction of what they once were.  This neighborhood like many in Istanbul is slated for redevelopment in the name of urban renewal.\\n\\nWow.  Look at that.  It\\'s a lot of food.\\n\\nCesar and his family have been running a restaurant here for nearly 20 years.\\n\\nCESAR:  The way that we make the food, it\\'s our own language.  That\\'s the whole idea about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So your family is Armenian?\\n\\nCESAR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is the food Armenian?\\n\\nCESAR:  This is my mom\\'s food whatever we eat at home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Authentic esnafs or tradesmen\\'s restaurants are getting harder and harder to find.  Most are family-owned businesses, the kind of place where you can get a classic home-style meal of traditional dishes.\\n\\nYou\\'re clearly romantic.  Do you think there is a place in modern Istanbul for romantics or will they slowly be crashed by modernity?\\n\\nCESAR:  Almost all the protesters they were (inaudible).  They were romantics.  They keep those people.  They use real guns, but they will still continue to protest, nothing else.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what\\'s the future of Armenians in Turkey?  Will it be more Armenians in Istanbul in 20 years or fewer?\\n\\nCESAR:  Of course, it will be less.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Less?\\n\\nCESAR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This turn towards a more conservative, more Islamist, is this a political calculation or do you think this is generally genuinely how people feel now?\\n\\nCESAR:  It\\'s the way that people feel now.  Because of the way that our president, the way that he talks, it\\'s not only political issue, it\\'s the reality itself.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what he has in mind, our president, but somehow he let people fight freedom, you know, hate.  What I believe that hate will be, you know, it will make an end soon.  That\\'s what I\\'m afraid of. That\\'s why I\\'m telling you that young generation, Armenians, they will definitely leave this country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  I hope you\\'re wrong.  I like to be -- I mean, I\\'m not really an optimistic person, but I hope you\\'re wrong about Istanbul because it\\'s an amazing place.\\n\\nCESAR:  I hope you will be the one who\\'s right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:27:05] EZAN, CAB DRIVER:  Hold on.  Give me help and not crash my car.  Not today, maybe tomorrow.  I have to pass this bus, if I don\\'t pass this bus...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is a long-held belief that if you want to know the real deal, what\\'s really good about a town...\\n\\nEZAN:  What a life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ...if you want to know where to find the good stuff, you ask a cab driver.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nEZAN:  I don\\'t know wrong way, right way.  Life is life.  What is what?  Take it easy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know if that\\'s true.  Not in my town, anyway.  But in Istanbul, I know a cab driver, my old friend, Ezan (ph).\\n\\nHello, my friend.  Good to see you.\\n\\nEZAN:  Oh, after all those years to meet you again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What a coincidence.\\n\\nEZAN:  Those are nice.  I love that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how are things in Istanbul?  It looks very different. They\\'re building stuff everywhere.\\n\\nEZAN:  I don\\'t know what happened, but I look up hotel, I look up shopping center open, more restaurant open, more disco open.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More discos?\\n\\nEZAN:  More disco.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So I thought this is a conservative government.\\n\\nEZAN:  Government conservative, but people, and they have to shake, they have to drink.  Life is too short.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nEZAN:  Most people ask me, did you make an accident?  And I say, yes, I killed two people, three people, hospital and then I pass cemetery. I said this is (inaudible) section.  They are scared.  Really?\\n\\nHow can you ask the taxi driver, did you make any accident?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nEZAN:  Again, we cross the Galata Bridge.  I love here.  Look at this city here, Santa Sofia there, Topkapi Palace there, new malls for the Armenian, Golden Horn.  I love this city, yahoo.  Come on, everybody. Istan has got crazy.  Taxi driver is nice job.  I love this job because you meet every time new people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nEZAN:  And on the way, you never get upset.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nEZAN:  I wish I dance, but I dance belly dance.\\n\\n[21:30:17] What\\'s in there?  Come on.  Everybody say this is not normal and I study about Ottoman, how to read, learn in Ottoman languages.  When you ask why Ezan want to learn this, because I want to read history, original.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Probably not while driving though. EZAN:  Yeah, yeah, not driving but the traffic already stopped a lot. If you -- I talk too much and you boring, and I go, take another taxi because I talk too much.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nEZAN:  This is my home area.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yeah, you live in this neighborhood?\\n\\nEZAN:  Yeah.  We call this area Lokanta.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this is a local favorite of yours, this restaurant?\\n\\nEZAN:  This restaurant I know since 30 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s cow foot, tripes.\\n\\nEZAN:  Tripes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very nice.  That looks good.  Man, this is just delicious.\\n\\nAre the young people more conservative or less conservative?\\n\\nEZAN:  My daughter, Mary, religious person and she has the scarf. Another daughter, Yank (ph) and 18 years old, short and moderate. They walk together.  One is scarf, one is not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nEZAN:  Maybe one day you invite me to America and I will be making...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dance.\\n\\nEZAN:  Belly dance on the American main road (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Probably you get arrested for that.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:36:15] GUNDUZ VASSAF:  The voice of Istanbul.  I\\'ve had at least 30 names on your own to Istanbul.\\n\\nNow they say I\\'m between the east and the west, an identity crises.  I know there\\'s enough for this nonsense.  Take the labels off and just look at me.\\n\\nYou won\\'t need a guidebook.  Like all cities, I have my own sense of time.  I\\'m a labyrinth of layers that only makes sense without a compass.\\n\\nIf you\\'re hesitant, not sure which way to go as you walk about, follow one of my cats.  They will lead you to places, introduce you to people, point out secrets they keep even from me.  They, more than anyone, are the longest continuing residents of the city A challenge to those who see their future in my past, I\\'m an obstacle for those who see only the future.  I see change with the patience of centuries.  Look at my silhouette from the bridge on the Golden Horn. Time has not passed me by.  It has protected me.  I ask of you the same.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An hour ferry ride and a world away are the Prince\\'s Islands in the Sea of Marmara.  Gunduz Vassaf and his friend, Serra Yilmaz have invited me for lunch.\\n\\nActor?  Translator?\\n\\nSERRA YILMAZ:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Philosopher?  Poet?  Are these good times to be a poet in Turkey?\\n\\nVASSAF:  It is, actually, because it\\'s a way to bring down the noise in a way because so much words are exchanged especially in heated political discussions.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have become very used to and fond of this drink, by the way.  Maybe too used to it and too fond of it.\\n\\nVASSAF:  I used to call it lime\\'s milk.  In a famous Turkish poet it is known for saying I wish I could be a fish in a bottle of liquor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Serra prepares a traditional spread of meze.  Turkish meze are extremely tasty, very diverse assortment of dishes originating at every corner of the former Ottoman Empire.\\n\\nThe Ottomans like to eat and entertain and they employed armies of cooks to dazzle them with ever-changing menus, variety being key. Circassian chicken, faba beans, rice with mussels, eggplant, stuffed grape leaves, poached eggs with yogurt, all classic and all delicious.\\n\\nYILMAZ:  What shall I give you?  A few of everything?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, please.\\n\\n[21:40:15] YILMAZ:  I\\'ll put some or maybe I could give you some chicken already.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Make room for that I think.  Here we go.  Wow.  It\\'s really pretty.  Am I getting a distorted picture of Turkey by spending all of my time in Istanbul?  It\\'s very different than the rest of the country.  How different?\\n\\nYILMAZ:  But I think in Istanbul, you have all the different parts of Turkey also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What does it mean to be Turkish?  What do you think?\\n\\nVASSAF:  Serra, are you Turkish?\\n\\nYILMAZ:  Yes, but it\\'s not my fault. BOURDAIN:  Man, this is so -- let me say, this food is extraordinary. I mean, really, really, really amazing.\\n\\nWhen I was here last, it was a very different mood.  Now at least, the tenor of the things said by the government are increasingly ugly.\\n\\nVASSAF:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An intolerant.  You have this social activism that\\'s very unusual.  Certainly, the government is sort of appealing to traditional Islamic values whether it\\'s for show or not, there seems to be some reevaluation of how much of a party town do we want to be?\\n\\nVASSAF:  These days, the powers that be don\\'t like it and...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do they genuinely not like it, or are they appealing to a political base?\\n\\nVASSAF:  Oh, no, it\\'s populism.  It\\'s a political base.  And lots of people, of course, play along saying that they don\\'t want to drink, et cetera, because that\\'s the way you get your contracts.  That\\'s the way you get things done.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean, nationalism seems to be working internally.\\n\\nVASSAF:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nationalism and xenophobia, it\\'s a vote getter almost anywhere.\\n\\nVASSAF:  Well, it\\'s a vote getter, but it\\'s a vote loser as well in the sense that there\\'s so much backlash.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think\\'s going to happen?\\n\\nVASSAF:  Get back to normal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think it will go?\\n\\nVASSAF:  Oh, yeah.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:46:48] BOURDAIN:  Walking down Istanbul streets, it\\'s easy to forget or not take seriously the slow but certain change in attitude towards this kind of freedom.  The right, for lack of a better term, to party.  The AKP is in power because the majority of voters put them there.  Their attitudes for better or worse reflect the attitudes of a great number of Turks.\\n\\nNURI:  All right, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Nuri, a Turkish businessman.\\n\\nI\\'m glad we met you because you are an AKP supporter.  You voted for AKP. NURI:  Yeah, I did.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Why?\\n\\nNURI:  Before, economy was so bad.  No foreign investment.  Interest rates were so high.  Inflation was about 100 percent per year.  So it\\'s very hard to make business in such circumstances.  In 2002, I had 78 employees.  Now it\\'s 250.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since I got here, I\\'ve been talking to a lot of people who are very upset about the environment, they\\'re upset about the destruction of old, beautiful buildings.  To a great extent, they do not like what much of the world would call progress.  So when you saw people running out in the streets and demonstrating, what was your feeling?\\n\\nNURI:  They said they went there for the trees.  They went there for the environment.  But at the end, they worked together, we did terrorize people.  We have to accept Istanbul like this.  You got nothing to do.  I cannot change it.  No one can change it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No going back.\\n\\nNURI:  Fifty years ago, they could do some things, but not now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re not sentimental about the old neighborhoods, the old?\\n\\nNURI:  No.  I\\'ve got used to it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a party town.  This is a nightclub town.  The impression is that there\\'s some ambivalence there.  Ten years from now, will we be able to come to this bar or a bar like it and drink lots of gin drinks and misbehave?  No problem?\\n\\nNURI:  No problem I think.  This is a party town.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nNURI:  We drink hard.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s all about money.\\n\\nNURI:  It\\'s all about money.  Everything is all about money in the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who will be Turkey\\'s bestest (ph) town?  Internationally? Which way are they looking, to the east or the west?\\n\\nNURI:  East, Russia, China, Vietnam and the Arabic countries.  Of course at west, Europe is getting weaker and weaker day by day.  The next 50 years, it\\'s going to be the era of the east, not the west.\\n\\n[21:50:11] BOURDAIN:  So these notions of like freedom of the press, these are not eastern concepts?\\n\\nNURI:  No.  No, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re not.  OK I\\'m going to ask you something.  Is freedom of the press overrated?\\n\\nNURI:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It\\'s overrated.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think tightening up on the press is a sacrifice that you\\'re willing to make for a good economy.  I don\\'t want to put words in your mouth or prosperity for the majority.\\n\\nNURI:  It is.  It\\'s the same all over the world.  It\\'s not typical for Turkey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nNURI:  That\\'s life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, thank you.\\n\\nNURI:  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a really bad idea.  OK.  Cheers.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n[21:55:] YALCINALP:  Hi?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Esra, of course, good to see you.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Welcome to our park.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.  I\\'m glad I haven\\'t eaten yet.  That is pretty awesome looking.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  So have you ever had Turkish breakfast before?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With you.  I love it, you need to do eggs in the park, pretty impressive.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Yeah.  This place is called (inaudible) Park.  It\\'s one of the last remaining parks in the vicinity.\\n\\nSince 2013, people have been gathering here in what we call forums to talk about their ideas for different -- how can I say?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Debates, chats, different people gathering here at night after work.  And then talking, trying to find solutions, right? We didn\\'t have any other place to go.  So we came here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why is it so important?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s not just for us, for future residents of Istanbul.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This space turns into a space of politics, a space of hope against the system which seems to be like impossible to break, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it impossible to break?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  Not now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was impossible a few weeks ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few weeks ago it was impossible.  So you\\'re feeling optimistic?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The hope is the revolution, you know?  If you lose your hope. then there is nothing to do.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  I think the tide is turning.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But for the -- if you compare Arab Spring and this park, I think -- I mean, in the Arab Spring, they are protesting against a dictatorship.  But in Turkey I think we can say there is democracy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Esra and her friends, previously unlikely to have known much less come to like one another were brought together by circumstances.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Have you been gassed?\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Not that much but yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By gas, are you talking about pollution?\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Yes, and also tear gas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, tear gas?\\n\\nYALCINALP:  When you are getting gassed together, you really connect through a life or death situations.  You hold each other and run away together.  It was a very actually emotional thing for me because all my life, I was taught to keep away from different types of peoples, like I never had a Kurdish friend.  I never had a people around me were all like me.  And I was lacking so much richness in my life. Thanks to (inaudible), I saw everyone is the same.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People are at real democracy in guessing people learn to speak.  Like, this is tear gas connecting people.\\n\\nYALCINALP:  Tear gas connecting people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is one way together.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Democracy is always a fragile thing.  Ninety two years ago, modern Turkey was assembled from the fragments of the Ottoman Empire.\\n\\nIt has always struggled to find a balance between those in power and the consent of its widely diverse population.\\n\\nSince the filming of this episode, Turkey\\'s newly elected parliament failed to form a coalition.  And President Erdogan quickly called for new elections.\\n\\nAt the same time, his revved up military action against Kurdish opposition forces in both Southeastern Turkey and across the border in Kurdish, Iraq.\\n\\nMany claimed that he effectively plunged Turkey into conflict in a bid to take advantage of an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.  And improve his party\\'s chances of success.  This is not an unreasonable assumption on anyone\\'s part.  Fear works.  Fear gets votes.  The opposition had hoped that the tide was turning.  It remains to be seen if they have any reason to hope.\\n\\n',\n",

The fist around your heart kind.\\n\\nI ran far but there was no escaping it.  It followed me upriver all the way.\\n\\nThat was ten long years ago, a previous episode of a previous series in a previous life.\\n\\nYet, here I am again, heading up to that same longhouse in the jungle.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I time I saw all this, I think it\\'s fair to say I was at a turning point in my life.\\n\\nI promised some people I\\'d come back, and I am back.  My life has changed a lot.  How much have their lives changed?\\n\\nKuala Lumpur.  Happy to be here, but brimming with mixed emotions. Surrounded by all the sights, smells, and flavors I remember so well.\\n\\nThis is where a wandering soul such as myself can dive right in and get some of that straight Chinese food I\\'ve been missing.\\n\\nFirst order of business, dinner.  I\\'ve been on a plane for, like -- I don\\'t know, it was long, very long.\\n\\nSo, like five Mark Wahlberg films.  I can\\'t tell you how excited I am about the prospect of getting some black pepper crab, some chocolate chow and some pork gladed noodles and a regional beverage.\\n\\nReasonably cold.  I don\\'t even know what this is.  How I love you, noodles.  Don\\'t want to get all heavy and philosophical at this point, but why I\\'m here, what my mission is, what I expect to find, basically me tracing my steps and all that.  We\\'ll talk about that later.  Right now, noodles.\\n\\nGood, wanton, this place is most excellent, oh, chocolate chow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Chocolate chow exactly. BOURDAIN:  Chocolate chow which is, oh, look at the greasy, fatty, yes, come to daddy.  I\\'m a bad man.  This is, like, a random restaurant, look like a purloin Minney Mouse logo.  And their food is unbelievably good.\\n\\nOh, yeah, black pepper crab is going right here.  Reveal yourself to me my love.\\n\\nHot, hot, hot, hot.  Oh, yeah.\\n\\nWow.  All right, the frenzy\\'s over.  Now, to eat in a more relaxed phase.\\n\\n[20:05:05] Kuala Lumpur, rises up out of steamy, equatorial southeast Asian jungle, Malaysia\\'s capital city, a chaotic, multi-ethnic, multi- cultural, modern metropolis of Malay, Chinese and India.\\n\\nThis is where you start out when fulfilling a decade-old promise to your ex-head hunter friends to return for Gawai.  The annual Iban Rice Harvest Festival.\\n\\nWhat\\'s was interesting the last time I was there, was the old guys with their tattoos and the rings on their fingers.\\n\\nEDDIE DAVID, BORNEO INK:  Yeah.  You know, a lot of people, a lot of them have passed on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hear no more skulls.  They made them put the skulls away.\\n\\nThe Iban once enjoyed a truly formidable reputation as trackers, warriors, and ritualistic takers of heads.\\n\\nThey were and continue to be wanderers.  Valuing the vaguely a tradition where every tribesman are going to set out from the longhouse of his birth to travel, learn, to bring something back.\\n\\nEach tattoo he gets over the course ever of his life represents a different experience, a different journey.\\n\\nDAVID:  I see you got tattoo that just to signify knowledge and good wealth and to drop back to the longhouse, what you probably would want to get is were not the wrong, some like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, like that.\\n\\nDAVID:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since last I saw you and you gave me this.\\n\\nDAVID:  And it\\'s still there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still there.  Ten years ago at his shop, Borneo Ink, Eddie David tattooed me with an Iban-style ouroboros, the symbol of the snake eating its own tail, life, death, the eternal ebb and flow.\\n\\nI think I was going through a hippy phase.  Eddie does great work and he\\'s known for traditional tribal tattoos, but I\\'m looking forward to getting it done old school this time.  Hand tapped in the jungle.\\n\\nSo, I need your advice because I\\'m going back from the same village that I went to last time.\\n\\nDAVID:  Just be careful of the Langkau.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Langkau, yes, they had it in every type of bottle. This is clear sort of cloudy liquid with particles in it.\\n\\nDAVID:  Sometimes they put weird stuff inside because my dad used to tell me they take a mosquito coil and leave it inside the Langkau.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A mosquito what?\\n\\nDAVID:  Coil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like the pesticide?\\n\\nDAVID:  Yeah.  Just make it, like, stronger, I guess.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I would imagine so.\\n\\nDAVID:  That\\'s a natural staple.  Gawai is usually sparing, drinking, passing out, waking up, eating, drinking some more, passing out again and then getting up and drinking some more.  Yeah, you\\'re going to have fun, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, all right.\\n\\nSo I\\'m headed upriver again.  Yes, sorry I can\\'t be there.  I promise to my adviser I\\'m going back.\\n\\nDAVID MAGGI (ph):  About nine years late on your promise, but...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nine years late.\\n\\nMAGGI (ph):  What happens with Langkau, you know, promises come liberally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was David Maggi (ph) who first took me up to the longhouse.  On that previous trip we met at Aunty Aini\\'s on the outskirts of K.L.\\n\\nMAGGI (ph):  Everything moves exponentially, right.  I just feels like some things remain exactly the same, some things haven\\'t changed at all.  This place is certainly one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The charming and for lack of a better word fabulous Aini was an actor in the Malaysian film scene who now runs a very successful kampung-style restaurant specializing in beloved village or country classics.\\n\\nAll of them prepared with a staggering finesse and precision.  This is delicious, delicious food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Welcome.  It\\'s been so long.  Oh, my god and you still look as handsome as ever.\\n\\nAll right, so...\\n\\nMAGGI (ph):  So let\\'s pick up right where we left off which started with this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help yourself.\\n\\nMAGGI (ph):  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You\\'re going to have the roast beef and this poached egg and our favorite will be our (inaudible) this is Chicken Renee.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So good to be back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I love watching you guys eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who taught you to cook?  Who was the good cook in your family?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When we were small, my grandmother would say stuff like, I don\\'t care who you are, if you can\\'t cook, you\\'re nobody to me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, wow.\\n\\n[20:09:59] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah, that from there.  There\\'s no teaching Malay cooking here.  It comes from your grandma\\'s kitchen, your mom\\'s kitchen.  And you learn by smelling, by seeing, it\\'s how I teach my children to cook.\\n\\nAll these dishes when you do them, the aroma just floats around.  I know exactly where the chili paste frying in the pan ready for not. It\\'s from here.  Basically it\\'s from here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, this food is so perfect.  I mean the flavors are so perfect.  It\\'s so delicious.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After a two-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur, I land in Borneo, third largest island in the world, divided between Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia.\\n\\nKuching capital of the Malaysian Sarawak, it\\'s a sleepily city with a colorful 19th century boys adventure story history.\\n\\nPirates, head hunters, opportunists, the former domain of Sir James Brook, an Englishman who came to be known as the \"White Rajah.\"\\n\\nFor a century, generations of the Brook family ruled Sarawak as an independent kingdom.  They created their own army, the Sarawak rangers who also acted as rajah\\'s personal guard.\\n\\nTomorrow I follow the pavement as far as it goes and then it\\'s boats the rest of the way.  But first, breakfast.  Unfortunately, I know exactly where to go.\\n\\nI sat at this same table last time.\\n\\nIf I look at my life as a continuum, a trail of noodles, going round and round the world until it comes right back to the same spicy bowl.\\n\\n[20:15:07] Oh, yeah, that is, can I say tumescent on CNN?  Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure I can.\\n\\nOh, yeah, baby this is a magical dish.  I don\\'t know, it\\'s like two types of noodles I think, chicken, prawn, coconut, chili.  But, you know, the main event for this is the broth.  The wisdom of the ages is contained in there.  It\\'s, like, super complex.\\n\\nMight need more of this.\\n\\nAll right, I\\'ll have another one of these, more.\\n\\nIt\\'s the broth, the broth.  Look at this.  Thank you.\\n\\nOK, now I\\'m becoming the object of much amusement.  People have noticed I\\'m on my second.\\n\\nDamn, best breakfast ever.\\n\\nI love that sound.\\n\\nBefore heading out to the longhouse, I\\'m meeting Kuching native Alex Wong at a dockside karaoke joint on the Malay side of town.\\n\\nNow what\\'s up with the karaoke here?  I mean it\\'s popular everywhere, but this is alcohol-free karaoke.\\n\\nALEX WONG, KUCHING NATIVE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In my experience, you got to be really adapted with karaoke, but here apparently not.\\n\\nWONG:  No, no, it\\'s the spirit.  Our people here, they can party any time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you\\'re coming upriver with us?\\n\\nWONG:  Yes, I am, I am.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Exciting.\\n\\nWONG:  ... four days of non-connectivity, you know, that, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I\\'m committed to that.  It\\'s the drinking.\\n\\nWONG:  I\\'m worried about that, too, really seriously, because I\\'m way past my drinking days, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes. WONG:  But I don\\'t think there\\'s an escape from it.  So why are you back in Kuching after ten years?  I mean why Kuching?  We have got -- we got a lot all the places in Borneo?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a good question.  I\\'m revisiting some stuff.  Just some -- I was in a weird place in my head when I first came here.  I was personally, professionally, everything in my life was changing.  I was in this sort of nowhere land between previous life and whatever came next.\\n\\nI\\'m retracing my steps to a lot of this to see if it still hurts.\\n\\nWONG:  Ah, OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And also I said I\\'d promise these guys in the village, the chiefs, that I\\'d come back.\\n\\nWell, I made a promise, and I\\'m going to live up to it.\\n\\n[20:20:26] WONG:  Yeah.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even the jungle wanted him dead.\\n\\nThis rang river, what\\'s the line, snakes through the Sarawak jungle like a main circuit cable, plugs straight in a -- somewhere.\\n\\nA place, a state of mind, I don\\'t know.  I was a basket case last time I went up this river, my mind miles away.\\n\\n[20:25:08] WONG:  Is this how you remember it, Tony?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nWONG:  Exactly the same, huh?  Ten years later?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pretty much, yeah, so far.\\n\\nYou pick your way upriver, like walking up a gradual flight of stairs, getting out often to push.\\n\\nWith several hours still to go a stop for lunch, there we are.  We\\'re even right on a beach too.\\n\\nAll right, that\\'s cool.\\n\\nWONG:  Looks like bamboo chicken there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good, ha.  (Foreign language).  It\\'s good, right?\\n\\nWONG:  It\\'s great, you said (Foreign language) that means delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, how\\'s your...\\n\\nWONG:  It\\'s possible, I guess all basic words. BOURDAIN:  I gather the plan is to try to get there before dark.\\n\\nWONG:  I don\\'t think it\\'s going to happen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, me either.\\n\\nWONG:  No.\\n\\nHello.  (Speaking Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All those years ago the man who looked after me at the longhouse was named Itom (ph).  Over 80 years old back then, he led us bounding uphill through the jungle like a young gazelle.\\n\\nHe still had the marks on his fingers of a man who\\'d taken heads, in Itom\\'s (ph) case, presumably communist guerillas when he fought with the British during the Malay insurgency.\\n\\nWe drank shots of rice whiskey together under replicate the human skulls, trophies from another time.  And I promised that I\\'d come back for Gawai a big day on the Iban calendar, when friends and relatives return to the longhouse.\\n\\nA lot has changed since the Iban tracked comis through the jungle. And much has changed in the ten years since I\\'ve been here.\\n\\nItom passed away the year before last at the age of 92.  And the evidence of how timbering he\\'s depleted much of the forest is everywhere, scandalously so.\\n\\nIt\\'s dark by the time we arrive.  But someone has been waiting for us.\\n\\nPlease advise me of protocol.\\n\\n(Speaking Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  All for me?\\n\\nWONG:  All of that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yeah, just like old times.\\n\\nThere you go, my man.  A custom must be observed.\\n\\n(Speaking Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wohoo.\\n\\n(Speaking Foreign Language)\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n[20:30:24] More cell phones than last time.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But it come with though.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My respect, my condolence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe again (inaudible) don\\'t come more.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: She cannot stand longer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of course.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n[20:35:55] BOURDAIN: Back in Entalau (ph) after a lot of years and a lot of miles. I wake up to the sounds of early morning village life. Roosters call. The coughing and clearing of lungs as the elders rise to perform their morning chores.\\n\\nThe whole village lives here in separate apartments, sharing a communal space that runs the length of the building. Some things have noticeably changed. The longhouse I first stayed in has been replaced by a somewhat more modern version. These days there\\'s electricity from a reliable diesel generator. And while there\\'s no cellphone signal, the plumbing works, the washing in the river is still, the way I see it, anyway, the preferable option.\\n\\nIn this part of the world, you live or die by the rice harvest. Less so these days as timbering has changed, well, everything out here, but traditions run deep, with the Iban and in Gawai, the harvest festival was and remains like Christmas and New Year\\'s rolled into one.\\n\\nWe will need pork for Gawai. And unfortunately, that means a pig must die. More awkwardly, custom, and my personal history in this village demands, once again, that I do the job.\\n\\nDown by the river, I shot my baby. What did he mean by that? Why would he do that? Shoot his baby? Unless baby was a delicious, delicious pig.\\n\\nI\\'d like to tell you that this is never easy, that I felt this time like I did the first time. Sad, nauseated, complicit, aware that I crossed a line, been changed by the violence and the blood and the awful noise. But that would be a lie.\\n\\n[20:40:02] Now?  Straight ahead?\\n\\nThis time, I plunged the spear in without hesitation or remorse.\\n\\nWhen the pig dies, finally gives it up, I feel only relief. I have been hardened by the last ten years. I don\\'t know what that says about me, but there it is.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:45:40] Far up the Skrang River, the countdown to Gawai is on, and I can\\'t help but be struck by one particular upgrade since my last visit.\\n\\nKaraoke. As I come to learn, constant karaoke. Never-ending karaoke. From a limited playlist of favorites. Nearly 24 hours a day accompanied by copious amounts of beer, Tuak and other strong spirits.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It should be pointed out Gawai isn\\'t just about consuming potentially blinding amounts of alcohol. It\\'s also about food. And one would be well advised to eat a lot. Lay down a solid base for the torment to come.\\n\\nOh, thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I see you so guilty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, no, not at all, actually.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So delicious.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, no it\\'s good (ph).  All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:   This is a bound tradition they keep of, you know, put rice on your plate, on it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. Good. Delicious.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: As the revelry kicks into high gear, there is nowhere to hide. I know only that if I sit still anywhere within range of hospitality, there will be a river of booze. Beer, Tuak, which is rough hand crafted local rice wine and its more lethal distilled bigger brother Langkau. Then somebody\\'s pouring you Johnny Black or J.D. or Vat 69. Then Langkau again, then who knows. You only know it keeps coming until you sag facedown on the hand woven math and pass out, perfectly acceptable practice, by the way.\\n\\n[20:50:21] Bring me back in paradise.\\n\\nI wake up, I go to sleep, I wake up again. The party has moved down a few doors, but it\\'s still going. This is an experience that will repeat itself again and again for the next three days. One time it\\'s the ladies still standing, partying like it\\'s 1999, dancing and drinking, and another time it\\'s the old dudes, the village chiefs and elders, and everybody, elders, women, children, visiting relatives and their families in Kuala Lumpur, and Kuching in the abroad, wherever circumstances, that\\'s the vaguely took them.\\n\\nThe party expands and contracts according to mysterious patterns that I am in no shape to discern.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One, two, three.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:55:37] Mourning routine, wake up, feed the chickens, rake the pepper drying in the sun, then it\\'s time to rock the bike people and it starts all over again.\\n\\nWhile the party continues up the longhouse I\\'ve got an appointment.\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering by the way if this hurts?  Two guys hammering a way on my sternum with a bamboo club and sharp needles. Yes.  Yes, it hurts a lot.  And you\\'re going to be damn sure if I wasn\\'t on television while it was happening, I\\'d be whimpering and yelping like gun-shot poodle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You, stand up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right, good? Very happy guys, thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Happy go life (ph). All right, let\\'s party. Another tattoo is never going to make me younger, or tougher or more relevant and won\\'t connect me 10 years from now with some spiritual crossroads in my life, no.\\n\\nAt this point I think my body is like an old car, another dent ain\\'t going to make a whole lot of difference. At best it\\'s a reminder that you are still alive and lucky as hell. Another tattoo, another thing you did, another place you\\'ve been.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) A final long gaze at the river, take in probably for the last time in my life, the slow rhythms of the village.  One more thing to do, say good-bye to an old friend.\\n\\nHe was a very strong man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I remember him well running uphill, faster than all of us. So do we do? We leave him a beer and some cigarettes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, you\\'re right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: He would like that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, he\\'d like.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: First cigarette in two years for you, man.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 on the principles of secular, democratic statehood after centuries of empire.\\n\\n[21:00:34] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It has been the most turbulent year in a decade of Turkey\\'s political history.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Turkey has set a new course, one that many hoped would carry it into the European Union.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s clearly a significant portion of the Turkish population that\\'s not happy with the policies of the democratically-elected government.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But things have changed.  They are changing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You get clashes erupting, demonstrators throwing rocks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And what happens next has implications far beyond Turkey.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It has been a turbulent year for Turkey.  And I arrive in Istanbul at the moment of a critical election.\\n\\nThe question on everyone\\'s mind is whether the current president and his ruling party will win a large enough majority to change the constitution, potentially allowing him to stay in power indefinitely.\\n\\nThese have been good times for some, particularly in the construction and development business.  And fearful ones for others.  They are particularly concerned about what happens next, for instance, in the Kurdish parts of town.\\n\\n(CHANTING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Our polls are opening.  Turkey\\'s voters choose a new parliament, which could lead to big changes in the country\\'s political system.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Ruling Justice and Development Party is expected to take most of the seats.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But how much power the president actually has will be determined by the success or failure of the Kurdish party.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The HDP, originally a Kurdish political party, has sought to unite the disparate voices calling for change, in response to 13 years of what has essentially been one-party rule by the AKP.  So history, whatever it might be, is about to happen.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just in the past hour, polls have closed in the country\\'s parliamentary elections.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Voters in Turkey have just shaken up the country\\'s political landscape in a major way.  They said no to placing Erdogan in push for more power.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The ruling AKP party did not win the majority its president had hoped for.  In fact, they lost seats in parliament, and for the first time, the pro-Kurdish party gained enough votes to earn a real voice in the government.\\n\\n[21:05:45] BOURDAIN:  We are at the very tip of Istanbul next to the Black Sea, so the ships that are going by here, they\\'re basically going to Russia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I meet an old friend, Esra (ph), for my first meal back in country.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I know you like your fish with the head and tail.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do.  This is perfect.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I ordered some raki.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That makes me so happy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, which is our national drink.  It is anise seeds and...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I am familiar with this drink, all too familiar.  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Welcome back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So since I last saw you, which was in 2000...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  2009.  Wow.  A long time ago.  Istanbul looks a little bit different than last time I was here.  It looks a little more like every other city.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Well, construction.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There seems to be a lot of that going on.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Your president likes to build stuff.  He likes to pour concrete.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He keeps the economy going.  Turkey\\'s so much politicized since the last time you came, like after 2011, the daily life issues, like how many children you should have, advising women not to laugh out loud in public, things like this were actually suggested by the government.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Do you think this is coming from genuine ideological religious place or is this a political calculation?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s a genuine...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re telling me that the current leadership is, in his heart, is genuinely opposed to alcohol, women laughing in public?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Maybe I don\\'t feel comfortable answering that question.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Turkey\\'s most famous politician, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he is the power and has been the power in one form or another for more than a decade.  He\\'s the face of Turkey\\'s ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP.\\n\\nErdogan has, in recent years, made Islamist politics mainstream, and while remaining very, very popular in this extremely polarized nation, cracked down hard on media, political opposition, free speech, and, of course, demonstrations.\\n\\nIn 2013, the almost revolution in Turkey happened, a protest to contest the demolition of Istanbul\\'s Gezi Park resulted in a brutal crackdown by police.\\n\\nIn response, ordinary Turks unconnected by any particular ideology poured into the streets.  With the whole world watching on social media, they, too, were met with force.\\n\\nIn the end, Erdogan remained firmly in control, and there were repercussions for many who had supported the protests.  From that point on, media, social media, even open discussion of issues or events, became treated as hostile acts by foreign enemies.\\n\\nAutocrats in general are not famous for their sense of humor, so it\\'s no surprise that comedians in Turkey like Denise (ph) and her fiancee Han (ph), walk a perilous line.\\n\\n(on camera):  Are these good times to be a comedian in Turkey?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It definitely is one of the best times because our former prime minister, support for them...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We don\\'t use the names.  We just call him the Greatness or, you know...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I guess they\\'re running the finals.  BOURDAIN:  The finals.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\n[21:10:08] BOURDAIN:  But all weight classes.  But it\\'s basically Greco-Roman wrestling.  Just get greased up.\\n\\nAs I understand it, you can\\'t choke with two hands, only one.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You can just slip your hands...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right into some greasy ass crack.  That\\'s OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And grab.  That\\'s fine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tell me something.  I want to know, what are the rules of the game.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Turkish oil wrestling.  A big freaking salad covered with oiled men in leather pants giving each other spirited and prolonged reach-arounds.  Oh, geez.\\n\\nCan we get rights to the Barry White greatest hits record or Diana Ross \"Love Hangover,\" or is that too obvious?  I like to be respectful of ancient tradition, but I mean, the jokes write themselves.  And they have, what, there\\'s, like, ropes inside or handles?  Where do I get a pair of those pants? Those are some super freaky pants.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Did you see the golden belts?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, look, it\\'s got to be because I mean, the pants are awesome.  Imagine what the belt looks like.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Does he stop yelling at some point?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The announcer called jaskar (ph)...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And in slang, jaskar (ph) means person who talks too much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s too loud.  It\\'s time for political end.  Lots changed since your last visit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Obviously, the mood has changed a lot, which is weird, because everything seemed to be going so well.  Things seemed to be getting more tolerant.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tolerance level is so low these days.  BOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People taking sides don\\'t like the other one. These people don\\'t like our kind.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what happens if someone doesn\\'t like your joke? Somebody in a powerful position does not like your comedy?  What happens?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Depending on the degree how much he doesn\\'t like you, how much he\\'s offended.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s say he\\'s really offended.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You go to jail for being, you know, terrorist or...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aiding and abetting the enemies of the state.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Enemy of the state.  Being enemy of the state is the most common thing you can do right now in Turkey.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They\\'re asking for more oil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More oil.\\n\\nIstanbul.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Building boom or building bubble.  Architect and city planner Luda Garman (ph) has been capturing Istanbul\\'s construction boom with his camera.  He employs a unique method of compressing panoramas to create a striking reimagining of cityscapes reflecting, perhaps, more of the reality than a straight photo could.\\n\\nLUDA GARMAN (PH), PHOTOGRAPHER:  I\\'ve been following what\\'s happening in Istanbul, because it\\'s my hometown, and what\\'s happening is that the new government is basing the supposedly booming economy totally on construction.\\n\\nSo what they did is they started to build high-rise housing, shopping malls, roads, and all that, but not necessarily buildings that are related to the making of culture.  So all this construction is related to consumption.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, are these spaces needed?  At whatever income level, will somebody be living in these buildings?\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  That\\'s a very good question.  I\\'m asking the same question.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  First things first.\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ll save the world later.\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  This is, like, the Turkish version of pizza, let\\'s say.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pita has some similarities.  I mean, there\\'s cheese in it. Dough.  But it\\'s more like a calzone maybe.  I don\\'t know.  It\\'s an efficient delivery vehicle for this case ground meat, cheese, and onions, a not-so-little torpedo straight from flavor town, but no, that would be wrong.\\n\\nI want to see what you do with this.  I want to see how you eat this. What do you do with that -- you dip in the egg?  Pour it in?\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm.  This is...\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  Cholesterol bomb we call it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s a remarkable lack of sentimentality about, really, one of the most uniquely glorious looking spaces anywhere.  Why don\\'t they care?\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  I agree.  There\\'s a lack of sentimentality, and there\\'s also a lack of vision, I believe, hometown vision.  We have very short-term visions.  Mostly based on money making.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When people look at the work you do, based on this city, what do you want them to see?\\n\\nGARMAN (ph):  First of all, I really value the sustainability of our political culture.  I want my work to show, \"Hey, look, this is what we had.\"  I think we are already losing it, so why don\\'t we stop here and maybe consider doing something else?\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[21:20:37] BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Nachambe Pozer (ph), long home to tradesmen, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians.  Groups whose populations are these days a tiny fraction of once they once were.  This neighborhood, like many in Istanbul, is slated for redevelopment in the name of urban renewal.\\n\\n(on camera):  Wow.  Look at that.  It\\'s a lot of food.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Cesar and his family have been running a restaurant here for nearly 20 years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The way that we make the food, it\\'s our own language.  That\\'s the whole idea about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So your family\\'s Armenian.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is the food Armenian?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is my mom\\'s food.  Whatever we eat at home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Authentic Hasnas (ph), or tradesmen\\'s restaurants, are getting harder and harder to find.  Most are family- owned businesses, the kind of place where you can get a classic home- style meal of traditional dishes.\\n\\n(on camera):  You\\'re clearly a romantic.  Do you think there\\'s a place in modern Istanbul for romantics, or will they slowly be crushed by modernity?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost all the protestors, they were kidnapped (ph).  They were romantics.  They killed those people.  They used real guns, but they will still continue to protest.  Nothing else.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what\\'s the future of Armenians in Turkey?  Will there be more Armenians in Istanbul in 20 years or fewer?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Much fewer.  Less.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Less?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This turn toward a more conservative, more Islamist, is this a political calculation or do you think this is generally genuinely how people feel now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s the way that people feel now.  Because of the way that our president, the way that he talks.  It\\'s not only political issue; it\\'s a reality.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what he has in mind, our president, but somehow he let people fight with hate.  I believe that hate will be, you know, it will make our end soon.  That\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.  That\\'s why I\\'m telling you that young generation, Armenians, they will definitely leave this country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  I hope you\\'re wrong.  I like to be -- I mean, I\\'m not really an optimistic person, but I hope you\\'re wrong about Istanbul, because it\\'s an amazing place.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I hope you will be the one who\\'s right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:27:10] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hold on.  Give me help and not crash my car.  Not today.  Maybe tomorrow.  I have to pass this bus.  If I don\\'t pass this bus.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It is a long-held belief that, if you want to know the real deal, what\\'s really good about a town...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What a life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... if you want to know where to find the good stuff, you ask a cab driver.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All back, all back.  Turn those around.  I don\\'t know wrong way, right way.  What is what.  Take it easy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know if that\\'s true.  Not in my town, anyway.  But in Istanbul, I know a cab driver.  My old friend, Esan (ph).\\n\\n(on camera):  Hello, my friend.  Good to see you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  After all those years.  To meet you again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What a coincidence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What a night.  I love that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  so how are things in Istanbul?  It looks very different. They\\'re building stuff everywhere.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t know what happened, but a lot of hotels, a lot of shopping center open, more restaurant open, more disco open.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More discos?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  More discos.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I thought this was a conservative government.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Government conservative, but the people, and they have to shake, they have to drink.  Life too short.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Relax.  Most people ask me, did you make an accident?  And I say, yes, I take two people, three people hospital and then I pass cemetery.  I said, \"This is Esan\\'s (ph) section.\" They are scared.\\n\\n\"Really?\"\\n\\nHow can you ask a taxi driver, did you make an accident?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re going across the Galata (ph) Bridge.  I love it here.  Look at this city.  Centers of (UNINTELLIGIBLE), moss- covered (UNINTELLIGIBLE).  New mosque.  Today (UNINTELLIGIBLE). Golden horn.  I love this city.\\n\\nYahoo!  Come on, everybody!  Esan (ph) is not crazy!\\n\\nTaxi driver is nice job.  I love this job because you meet every time new people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And on the way, you never get upset.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nI wish I dance, but I don\\'t belly dance.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nTAXI DRIVER:  Wha!  (wha me ah)  (Come on.)  Everybody say this not normal.  I study about Ottoman.  How to read learning Ottoman languages.  When you ask why is (son) to learn this?  Because I want to read history original.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Probably not while driving though.\\n\\nDRIVER:  Yah, yah, not driving, but the traffic already stop. (speaking foreign language)  Maybe I talk too much and you boring and I go.  Take another taxi because I talk too much.  (speaking foreign language)  This is my home area.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yeh?  You live in this neighborhood?\\n\\nDRIVER:  Yeh.  We call this area (Locanta).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this is a local favorite of yours, this restaurant?\\n\\nDRIVER:  This restaurant I know since 30 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s cow, cow foot, tripes.\\n\\nDRIVER:  Tripes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very nice.  That looks good.  Man, this is just delicious.\\n\\nAre the young people more conservative or less conservative?\\n\\nDRIVER:  My daughter married, religious person, and she has a scarf. Another daughter, young, 18 years old, short and modern.  They walk together, one is scarf, one is not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nDRIVER:  Maybe one day you invite me America and will be make belly dance on the American main road, shaking my body.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Probably get arrested for that.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nNARRATOR:  The voice of Istanbul.  I\\'ve had at least 30 names from New Rome to Islambol.  Now they say I\\'m between the East and the West, an identity crisis.  I knew theirs.  Enough of this nonsense.  Take the labels off and just look at me.  You won\\'t need a guide book.  Like all cities, I have my own sense of time.  I\\'m a labyrinth of layers that only make sense without a compass.  If you\\'re hesitant, not sure which way to go as you walk about, follow one of my cats.  They will lead you to places, introduce you to people, point out secrets they keep even from me.  They, more than anyone, are the longest continuing residents of this city.  A challenge to those who see the future in my paths, I\\'m an obstacle for those who see only the future.  I see change with the patience of centuries.  Look at silhouette on the bridge on the Golden Horn.  Time has not passed me by, it has protected me.  I ask of you the same.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An hour ferry ride and a world away are the Princes\\' Islands in the Sea of Marmara.  Gunduz Vassaf and his friend, Serra Yilmaz, have invited me for lunch.  Actor, translator?\\n\\nSERRA YILMAZ, ACTRESS:  Yeh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Philosopher, poet.  Are these good times to be a poet in Turkey/\\n\\nGUNDUZ VASSAF, PH.D., PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR:  It is actually, because it\\'s a way to bring down the noise in a way.  Because so much words are exchanged, especially in heated political discussions.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have become very used to and fond of this drink, by the way.  Maybe too used to it and too fond of it.\\n\\nVASSAF:  They used to call it lion\\'s milk.  And a famous Turkish poet is knowing for saying I wish I could be a fish in a bottle of Raki.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Serra prepares a traditional spread of meze.  Turkish meze are an extremely tasty, very diverse assortment of dishes originating in every corner of the former Ottoman Empire.  The Ottomans liked to eat and entertain, and they employed armies of cooks to dazzle them with ever-changing menus, variety being key.  Circassian chicken, fava beans, rice with mussels, eggplant, stuffed grape leaves, poached eggs with yogurt, all classic and all delicious.\\n\\nYILMAZ:  What shall I give you?  A few of everything?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, please.\\n\\nYILMAZ:  I\\'ll put some -- oh, maybe I could give you some chicken already.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I can make room for that I think.  Here we go.  Wow, it\\'s really pretty.  Am I getting a distorted picture of Turkey by spending all of my time in Istanbul?  It\\'s very different than the rest of the country, yeh?  How different.\\n\\nYILMAZ:  Mmm, but I think in Istanbul you have all the different parts of Turkey also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What does it mean to be Turkish?  What do you think?\\n\\nVASSAF:  Serra, are you Turkish?\\n\\nYILMAZ:  Yes, but it\\'s not my fault.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Man, this is so...  Let me say, this food is extraordinary. I mean really, really, really amazing.  But when I was here last it was very different mood.  Now at least the tenor of the things said by the government are increasingly ugly and intolerant.  And you\\'ve got this social activism that\\'s very unusual.  Certainly the government is sort of appealing to traditional Islamic values.  Whether it\\'s for show or not, there seems to be some reevaluation of how much of a party town do we want to be.\\n\\nVASSAF:  These days the powers that be don\\'t like it.  And...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do they genuinely not like it or are they appealing to a political base?\\n\\nVASSAF:  Oh, no, no.  It\\'s (populism), it\\'s a political base.  And lots of people are supposed to play along, saying that they don\\'t want to drink, et cetera, because that\\'s the way you get your contracts, that\\'s the way you get things done.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean nationalism seems to be working internally. Nationalism and xenophobia, it\\'s a vote-getter almost anywhere.\\n\\nVASSAF:  Well, it\\'s a vote getter, but it\\'s a vote loser as well in the sense that there\\'s so much back lash.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do -- what do you think\\'s going to happen?\\n\\nVASSAF:  It\\'ll get back to normal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think it\\'ll go...\\n\\nVASSAF:  Oh, yeh.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Walking down Istanbul\\'s streets, it\\'s easy to forget or not take seriously the slow but certain change in attitude towards this kind of freedom.  The right, for lack of a better term, to party.  The AKP is in power because a majority of voters put them there.  Their attitudes, for better or worse, reflect that attitudes of a great number of Turks.  This is (Nouri), a Turkish businessman.  I\\'m glad we met you because you are an AKP supporter.  You voted for AKP?\\n\\n(NOURI):  Yeh, I did.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Why?\\n\\n(NOURI):  Before the economy was so bad.  No foreign investment, interest rates were so high, inflation was about 100 percent per, per (year), so it\\'s very hard to make business in such circumstances.  In 2002 I had 70 employees.  Now it\\'s 250.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since I got here I\\'ve been talking to a lot of people who are very upset about the environment, they\\'re upset about the destruction of old, beautiful buildings.  To a great extent they do not like what much of the world would call progress.  So when you say people running out in the streets to demonstrate, what was your feeling?\\n\\n(NOURI):  They said they went there for the trees, they went there for the environment.  But at the end, they were together with the terrorist people.  They have to accept Istanbul like this.  You got nothing to do.  I cannot change it, no one can change it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No going back.\\n\\n(NOURI):  Fifty years ago they could do some things.  But not now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re not sentimental about the old neighborhoods, the old...\\n\\n(NOURI):  No.  I got used to it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a party town.  This is a night club town.  The impression is that there\\'s some ambivalence there.  Ten years from now, will we be able to come to this bar or a bar like it and, and, and drink lots of gin drinks and misbehave?  No problem?\\n\\n(NOURI):  No problem.  This is still a party town.  We drink hard.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s all about money.\\n\\n(NOURI):  It\\'s all about money.  Everything is all about money in the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who will be Turkey\\'s (best-est) now internationally?  Which way are they looking?  To the East or the West?\\n\\n(NOURI):  East.  Russia, China, Iran, and the Arabic countries. Because the West and Europe is getting weaker and weaker day by day. The next 50 years is going to be the era of the East, not the West.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm-hmm.  So these notions like freedom of the press, these are not Eastern concepts?\\n\\n(NOURI):  No, no, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re not.  OK, I want to ask you something.  Is freedom of the press overrated?\\n\\n(NOURI):  Yeh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (laughing)\\n\\n(NOURI):  Yeh, yeh, yeh.  It\\'s overrated.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think it -- tightening up on the press is a sacrifice that you\\'re willing to make for a good economy?  I don\\'t want to put words in your mouth.  For prosperity for the majority.\\n\\n(NOURI):  That is the same all over the world.  It\\'s not typical for Turkey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s right.  So, thank you.  Thank you.  This is a really bad idea.  OK, cheers.  (Nosdrovia).\\n\\n(NOURI):  (Nosdrovia). (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (inaudible)  Of course, good to see you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Welcome to our park.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.  I\\'m glad I haven\\'t eaten yet.  That is pretty awesome looking.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So have you ever had Turkish breakfast before?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With you.  I love that we can do eggs in the park.  Pretty impressive.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This place is (Abbasaga) Park.  It\\'s one of the last remaining parks in the vicinity.  Since 2013 people have been gathering here in what we call forums to talk about their ideas for different -- how can I say?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Debates, chats.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm-hmm.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Different people gathering here at night after work, and then talking, trying to find solutions, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We didn\\'t have any other place to go, so we came here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why is it so important?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s not just for us, for future residents of Istanbul.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This space turns into a space of politics, a space of hope against a system which seems to be like impossible to break actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it impossible to break?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, not now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was impossible a few weeks ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few weeks ago it was impossible.  But you, you\\'re feeling optimistic?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The hope is the revolution, you know?  If you lose you hope then there\\'s nothing to do.  I think the tide is turning.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But for the -- if you compare Arab Spring and this park I think -- I mean in the Arab Spring they are protesting against a dictatorship.  But in Turkey I think we can say that there is democracy. BOURDAIN:  (Essra) and her friends previously unlikely to have known, much less come to like, one another were brought together by circumstances.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Have you been gassed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Not as much, but yeh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By gassed, you mean -- are you talking about pollution?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tear gas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, tear gas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you are getting gassed together you really connect through life or death situations.  You hold each other and run away together.  It was a very actually emotional thing for me because all my life I was taught to keep away from different types of people. Like I never had a Kurdis friend.  I never had a -- people around me were all like me, and I was lacking so much richness in my life. Thanks to (Gezi) I saw everybody is the same.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People are (inaudible) real democracy in (Gezi). People learn to speak (inaudible) produces tear gas connecting people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tear gas connecting people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (inaudible) just run away together.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Democracy is always a fragile thing.  Ninety-two years ago modern Turkey was assembled from the fragments of the Ottoman Empire. It always struggled to find a balance between those in power and the consent of its widely-diverse population.\\n\\nSince the filming of this episode, Turkey\\'s newly-elected parliament failed to form a coalition and President Erdogan quickly called for new elections.  At the same time, he\\'s revved up military action against Kurdish opposition forces in both southeastern Turkey and across the border in Kurdish Iran.  Many claim that he effectively plunged Turkey into conflict in a bid to take advantage of an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty and improve his party\\'s chances of success.  This is not an unreasonable assumption on anyone\\'s part. Fear works.  Fear gets votes.  The opposition had hoped that the tide was turning.  It remains to be seen if they have any reason to hope.\\n\\n',\n",

I ran far but there was no escaping it.  It followed me up river all the way.  That was 10 long years ago, a previous episode of a previous series in a previous life yet, here I am again heading up to that same longhouse in the jungle.\\n\\nLast time I saw all this, I think it\\'s fair to say I was at a turning point in my life.  I promised some people I\\'d come back, and I am back.  My life has changed a lot.  How much have their lives changed?\\n\\nKuala Lumpur.  Happy to be here, but brimming with mixed emotions.

Been on a plane for, like, I don\\'t know, it was long.  Very long.  Saw, like, five Mark Wahlberg films. I can\\'t tell you how excited about the prospect of getting some black pepper crab, some Char kway teow and some pork gladed noodles and a regional beverage -- reasonably cold.\\n\\nI don\\'t even know what this is.  I love you, noodles.  Don\\'t want to get all heavy and philosophical at this point, but why I\\'m here, what my mission is, what I expect to find, basically me tracing my steps and all that.

Now eat in a more relaxed phase.\\n\\n[21:05:04] Kuala Lumpur rises up out of steamy, equatorial, Southeast Asian jungle, Malaysia\\'s capital city -- a chaotic, multiethnic, multicultural modern metropolis of Malay, Chinese, and Indian.\\n\\nThis is where you start out when fulfilling a decade-old promise to your ex-headhunter friends to return for Gawai, the annually Iban rice harvest festival.\\n\\nWhat was interesting the last time I was there was the old guys with their tattoos and rings on their fingers.\\n\\nEDDIE DAVID, BORNEO INK TATTOO ARTIST:  Yeah.  The old people, a lot of them have passed on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hear no more skulls.  They made them put the skulls away.\\n\\nThe Iban once enjoyed a truly formidable reputation as trackers, warriors, and ritualistic takers of heads.  They were and continue to be wanderers valuing the bejalai, a tradition where every tribesman was set out from the longhouse of his birth to travel, learn, to bring something back.  Each tattoo he gets over the course of his life represents a different experience, a different journey.\\n\\nDAVID:  Basically the tattoos are just to signify knowledge and the wealth they brought back to the longhouse, what you probably would want to get is a warna terang (ph).  Something like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like that.\\n\\nDAVID:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since last I saw you, and you gave me this...\\n\\nDAVID:  And it\\'s still there?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still there.  10 years ago at his shop, Borneo Ink, Eddie David tattooed me with an Iban style ouroboros, the symbol of a snake eating its own tail.  Life, death, the eternal ebb and flow.  I think I was going through a hippy phase.  Eddie does great work and he\\'s known for traditional tribal tattoos, but I\\'m looking forward to getting it done old school this time -- hand tapped in the jungle. So, i need your advice because I\\'m going back to the same village that I went to last time.\\n\\nDAVID:  Just be careful of the Langkaw (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Langkaw?  Yes, they had it in every type of bottle. This is clear sort of cloudy liquid with particles in it.\\n\\nDAVID:  Sometimes they put all kinds of weird stuff inside. My dad used to tell me they take mosquito coil and leave it inside the langkaw.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A mosquito what?\\n\\nDAVID:  Coil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like the pesticide?\\n\\nDAVID:  Yeah. Just make it, like, stronger, I guess.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I would imagine so.\\n\\nDAVID:  That\\'s a natural staple, Gawai, is usually partying, drinking, passing out, waking up, eating, drinking some more, passing out again then getting up and drinking some more.  Yeah.  You\\'re going to have fun, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  All right.  So I\\'m headed upriver again.\\n\\nDAVID MAGI (ph):  Yes, sorry I can\\'t be there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I promised them, I said, \"I\\'m going back.\"\\n\\nMAGI:  About nine years late on your promise, but...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nine years late.\\n\\nMAGI:  That happens. You know, promises come liberally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was David Magi who first took me up to the longhouse. On that previous trip we met at Aunty Aini\\'s on the outskirts of K.L.\\n\\nMAGI:  Everything moves exponentially, right.  I just feel like some things remain exactly the same, some things haven\\'t changed at all. This place is certainly one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The charming and for lack of a better word fabulous Aini was an actor in the Malaysian film scene who now runs a very successful Kampung style restaurant specializing in beloved village or country classics. All of them prepared with a staggering finesse and precision. This is delicious, delicious food.\\n\\nAINI, OWNER OF AUNT AINI\\'S RESTAURANT, ACTRESS:  Welcome. It\\'s been so long.  Oh, my. You still look as handsome as ever.  All right.  So...\\n\\nMAGI:  So let\\'s pick up right where we left off which started with this.\\n\\nAINI:  Help yourself.\\n\\nMAGI:  Thank you.\\n\\nAINI:  You\\'re going to have the roast beef and poached egg and our favorite will be our rendang.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nAINI:  This is chicken rendang.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So good to be back.\\n\\nAINI:  I love watching you guys eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who taught you to cook?  Who was the good cook in your family? AINI:  When we were small, my grandmother would say stuff like, I don\\'t care who you are, if you can\\'t cook, you\\'re nobody to me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nAINI:  Yeah, they\\'re from there.  There\\'s no teaching Malay cooking here.  It comes from your grandma\\'s kitchen, your mom\\'s kitchen.\\n\\n[21:10:02] And you learn by smelling, by seeing.  That\\'s how I teach my children to cook.  All the dishes when you do them, the aroma just floats around.  I know exactly where the chili paste frying in the pan is ready for not.  It\\'s from here.  Basically it\\'s from here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  This food is so perfect.  I mean the flavors are so perfect.  It\\'s so delicious.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After a two-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur, I land in Borneo, third largest island in the world.  Divided between Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia.  Kuching, capital of the Malaysian Sarawak. It\\'s a sleepily city with a colorful 19th century boys adventure story history, pirates, head hunters, opportunists, the former domain of Sir James Brook, an Englishman who came to be known as the white raja.\\n\\nFor a century, generations of the Brook family ruled Sarawak as an independent kingdom.  They created their own army, the Sarawak Rangers who also acted as raja\\'s personal guard.  Tomorrow I follow the pavement as far as it goes then it\\'s boats the rest of the way.  But first, breakfast.  And fortunately, I know exactly where to go.\\n\\nI sat at this same table last time.  I look at my life as a continuum, a trail of noodles.  Going round and round the world until it comes right back to the same spicy bowl.\\n\\n[21:15:00] Oh, yeah, that is, can I ay tumescent on CNN?  Yeah, pretty sure I can.\\n\\nOh, yeah, baby.  This is a magical dish.  I don\\'t know.  It\\'s like two types of noodles I think.  Chicken, prawn, coconut, chili.  You know, the main event of this is the broth.  The wisdom of the ages is contained in there.  It\\'s, like, super complex. Might be more of this.\\n\\nAll right.  I\\'ll have another one of these.  More.  It\\'s the broth. The broth.  Look at it.  Thank you.  Now I I\\'m becoming the object of much amusement.  People have noticed I\\'m on my second.  Damn.  Best breakfast ever.\\n\\nLove that sound.\\n\\nBefore heading out to the longhouse, I\\'m meeting Kuching native Alex Wong at a dockside karaoke joint on the Malay side of town.  Now, what\\'s up to the karaoke here?  It\\'s popular everywhere, but this is alcohol-free karaoke.\\n\\nALEX WONG, KUCHING NATIVE:  Yes. BOURDAIN:  In my experience, you have to be really (inaudible) up to do karaoke, but here apparently not.\\n\\nWONG:  No, no.  It\\'s the spirit, you know.  Our people here, they can party any time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you\\'re coming upriver with us?\\n\\nWONG:  Yes, I am.  I am.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Exciting.\\n\\nWONG:  And four days of non-connectivity, you know that, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  I\\'m committed to that.  It\\'s the drinking.\\n\\nWONG:  I\\'m worried about that, too, seriously, because I\\'m way past my drinking days, you know...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nWONG:  ... but I don\\'t think there\\'s an escape from it.  Why are you back in Kuching after 10 years?  AAnd why Kuching, you\\'ve got a lot other places in Borneo?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a good question.  I\\'m revisiting some stuff.  Just some -- I was in a weird place in my head when I first came here.  I was personally, professionally, everything in my life was changing.  I was in this sort of nowhere land between previous life and whatever came next.  I\\'m retracing my steps to a lot of this to see if it still hurts.\\n\\nWONG:  Ah, OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And also I said -- I\\'d promise these guys in the village, the chiefs, that I\\'d come back.  Well, I made a promise, and I\\'m going to live up to it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:24:18]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even the jungle wanted him dead.  This Skrang river, what\\'s the line, snakes through the Sarawak jungle like a main circuit cable, plugged straight in a, somewhere.  A place.  The state of mind.  I don\\'t know.  I was a basket case last time I went up this river.  My mind miles away.\\n\\n[21:25:00]\\n\\nWONG:  Is this how you remember it, Tony?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nWONG:  Exactly the same? 10 years later? BOURDAIN:  Pretty much.  Yeah, so far.  You pick your way upriver,\\n\\nlike walking up a gradual flight of stairs, getting out often to push. With several hours still to go, a stop for lunch.  There we are. We\\'re even right on a beach, too.  All right.  That\\'s cool.\\n\\nWONG:  Looks like bamboo chicken there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yamay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good, right?\\n\\nWONG:  It\\'s great.  He said Yamay.  Yamay, that means delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, how\\'s your Iban?\\n\\nWONG:  It\\'s possible, I guess.  A little basic words.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I gather the plan is to try to get there before dark.\\n\\nWONG:  I don\\'t think it\\'s going to happen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, me either.\\n\\nWONG:  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  Hello.\\n\\nWONG:  Hello.\\n\\n(Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All those years ago the man who looked after me at the longhouse was named Itam.  Over 80 years old back then, he led us bounding uphill through the jungle like a young gazelle.  He still had the marks on his fingers of a man who\\'d taken heads, in Itam\\'s case, presumably, communist guerillas when he fought with the British during the Malay insurgency.\\n\\nWe drank shots of rice whiskey together under a bouquet of human skulls, trophies from another time.  I promised I\\'d come back for Gawai, a big deal in the Iban calendar, when friends and relatives return to the longhouse.\\n\\nA lot has changed since Iban tracked communists through the jungle and much has changed in the 10 years since I\\'ve been here.  Itam passed away the year before last at the age of 92, and the evidence of how timbering has depleted much of the forest is everywhere, scandalously so.\\n\\nIt\\'s dark by the time we arrived, but someone has been waiting for us. Please advise me of protocol.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language) BOURDAIN:  Thank you.  All for me.  Oh, yeah.  Just like old times. There you go, my man.  Custom must be observed.  Thank you.  Woo.  Oh, yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\n[21:30:03]\\n\\nWONG:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More cell phones than last time.\\n\\nWONG:  It\\'s a great welcome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pardon?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Madam, my respect, my condolence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nShe cannot stand longer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of course.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:19]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Back in Entalau after a lot of years and a lot of miles.  I wake up to the sounds of early morning village life.  Roosters call. The coughing and clearing of lungs as the elders rise to do chores. The whole village leaves here in separate apartments sharing a communal space that runs the length of the building.  Some things have noticeably changed.  The longhouse I first stayed in has been replaced by a somewhat more modern version.\\n\\nThese days there\\'s electricity from a reliable diesel generator.  And while there\\'s no cell phone signal, the plumbing works, the washing in the river is still, the way I see it, anyway, the preferable option.\\n\\nIn this part of the world, you live or die by the rice harvest. Less so these days as timbering has changed, well, everything out here, but traditions run deep, with the Iban and Gawai, the harvest festival was and remains like Christmas and New Year\\'s rolled into one.\\n\\nWe will need pork for Gawai.  And unfortunately, that means a pig must die.  More awkwardly, custom, and my personal history in this village demands, once again, that I do the job.  Down by the river, I shot my baby.  What did he mean by that?  Why would he do that?  Shoot his baby?  Unless baby was a delicious, delicious pig.\\n\\nI\\'d like to tell you that this is never easy, that I felt this time like I did the first time.  Sad, nauseated, complicit, aware that I crossed a line, been changed by the violence and the blood and the awful noise.  But that would be a lie.  This time, I plunged the spear in without hesitation or remorse.\\n\\n[21:40:18] When the pig dies, finally gives it up.  I feel only relief.  I have been hardened by the last 10 years.  I don\\'t know what that says about me, but there it is.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:45:28]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Far up Skrang River, the countdown to Gawai is on, and I can\\'t help but be struck by one particular upgrade since my last visit.  Karaoke.  As I come to learn, constant karaoke.  Never-ending karaoke.  From a limited playlist of favorites.  Nearly 24 hours a day accompanied by copious amounts of beer, tuak and other strong spirits.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It should be pointed out Gawai isn\\'t just about consuming potentially blinding amounts of alcohol.  It\\'s also about food.  And one would be well advised to eat a lot.  Lay down a solid base for the torment to come.  Oh, thank you.  I feel so guilty.  No, no, not at all, actually.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Should not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So delicious. All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Tradition that people put rice on your plate.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (inaudible)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nAttention, from the first room of this longhouse to the last, tonight we are going to drink to a long life.  Please drink nicely.  Don\\'t argue over politics.  I will not hear any of it.  Even if you get drunk, no fights because a bad name will come to my longhouse.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Welcome back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nAs the revelry kicks into high gear, there is nowhere to hide.  I know only that if I sit still anywhere within range of hospitality, there will be a river of booze.  Beer, tuak, which is rough hand crafted local rice wine and its more lethal distilled brother, langkaw.  Then somebody\\'s pouring you Johnny Black or J.D. or Vat 69.  Then, langkaw again, then, who knows. You only know it keeps coming until you sag facedown on the hand-woven mats and pass out.\\n\\n[21:50:03] Perfectly acceptable practice, by the way.\\n\\nI wake up, I go to sleep, I wake up again.  The parties move down a few doors but it\\'s still going.  This is an experience that will repeat itself again and again for the next three days.  One time it\\'s the ladies still standing, partying like it\\'s 1999, dancing and drinking.  And another time it\\'s the old dudes, the village chiefs and elders.  And then everybody, elders, women and children visiting relatives and their families from Kuala Lumpur, Kuching, and from abroad, whatever circumstances that the bejalai took them. And the parties are in no shape to discern.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  One, two, three.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:55:35]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Morning routine, wake up, feed the chickens, rake the pepper drying in the sun and then it\\'s time to rock the bike, people, and it starts all over again.  While the party continues up at the longhouse, I\\'ve got an appointment.\\n\\nIf you were wondering by the way if this hurts, two guys hammering away on my sternum with a bamboo club and sharp need tells.  Yes, it hurt a lot and you can be damn sure if I wasn\\'t in television while it was happening, I\\'d be whimpering and yelping like a gut shot poodle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Right there.  Stand up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  Good.  Very happy, guys.  Thank you. (Inaudible).  All right.  Let\\'s party.\\n\\nAnother tattoo is never going to make me younger, tougher or more relevant.  It won\\'t reconnect me 10 years from now with some spiritual crossroads in my life.  No.\\n\\nAt this point, I think my body is like an old car.  Another dent ain\\'t going to make a whole lot of difference.  At best, it\\'s a reminder that you\\'re still alive and lucky as hell.\\n\\nAnother tattoo, another thing you did, another place you\\'ve been.  The final long gaze at the river, take in probably for the last time in my life, the slow rhythms.  One more thing to do, say goodbye to an old friend. He was a very strong man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I remember him well running uphill faster than all of us. So what do we do?  Leave him a beer, some cigarettes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He would like that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yes, he\\'ll like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First cigarette in two years (inaudible).\\n\\n[22:00:10]\\n\\nBEN CARSON, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Do you think I\\'m pathological liar like CNN does?\\n\\n',\n",

Others have to sift through the pieces.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(INTRO MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:  Addis Ababa (Speaking in foreign Language)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Admit it.  You hear the name, Ethiopia, and you think starving children with distended bellies.  You think just and famine and despair so awful you frankly do not want to even think about it anymore.\\n\\nBut take a look, Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia.  A cool high altitude urban center that will both confirm and confound expectations.  Fueled largely by direct foreign investment and a returning Ethiopian Diaspora eager to be part of the new growth, things are changing in Addis.  It is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.\\n\\nIt is not the first time the place has gone through a growth spurt.  In the 1950s, Emperor Haile Seassie known as the king of kings embarked on a similar program of massive public works.  This was supposed to be legacy of the Ethiopia.  The future.\\n\\nBut the next time Ethiopia found itself in the headlines, it was for this.  And, for many of us, that was the end of the story.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, I am looking forward to this week.        MARCUS \\'JOAR\\' SAMUELSSON, ETHEIOPIAN-BORN, SWEDISH-RAISED CHEF\\n\\nAND RESTAURATEUR:  I cannot wait to show you Ethiopia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have been waiting for you.  I tell you right now.\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  Yes.  I could not have picked a better time, because we have old Ethiopia right here and we also have new Ethiopia right here.  And, that is like - that combo is going to be so cool.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Marcus Samuelsson.  Maybe you know him from such shows as a lot of them or his many restaurants, his bestselling memoir, his status as America\\'s most recognizable black chef.  But, Marcus is not African-American.\\n\\nHe is Swedish-American or Ethiopian-Swedish-American or -- look, it is complicated.  What is true to say is that Marcus Samuelsson like his wife, Maya, was born here in Ethiopia.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, when was the last time you were in Ethiopia?\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  Four years ago, and you can tell it is changed.  It changed a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I am interested in seeing an African country that was never colonized.  It was never taken by Europe.\\n\\nSAMUELSON:  No, that sense of pride -- and you really hit the nail on the head.  I mean, that sense of pride is also the sense of that everyone wants to come back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  How does it feel coming back?  Is it weird at all?  You feel like you are coming home?\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  It is weird, but end of the day, I always love it. I miss it.  One foot of me is like, just Ethiopian, but then the other foot is just so Swedish or American at this point, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You do not speak the language here or any of the dialects.\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You have -- since you come back here, you reconnected with family.\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  But it must be weird to, I mean --\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  It is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  To -- you need a translator.\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  No, but -- I need a translator.  My wife is not my translator in life and in culture and so many things, but I think when -- when you are a black man, when you are an immigrant, when you are an Ethiopian, when you are a Swedish, I have been put in so many situations that I put myself into.  So, I am actually very comfortable enough being uncomfortable.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n[21:05:20]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  In the 1970s, Ethiopia was hit with a tuberculosis epidemic.  Marcus, his older sister, Fantaye, and his mom were all stricken with the disease.  With no possibility of medical attention in their village, facing the almost inevitable death of both her children, Marcus\\' mom set out on foot with her daughter at her side and 2-year-old Marcus on her back walking 75 miles to the Swedish hospital in Addis.\\n\\nAgainst all odds, they made it.  Marcus and Fantaye recovered. Their mother did not.  Marcus and his sister were adopted by Ann Marie and Lennart Samuelsson, and raised from that point on in Sweden. Ethiopia, it\\'s language, it\\'s food, it\\'s cultures was largely a mystery.\\n\\nMarcus traveled and trained, apprenticing in some of the great kitchens of Europe.  He moved to New York.  Ad, at the remarkably young age of 23 received three stars from \"The New York Times\" at his groundbreaking restaurant, \"Aquavit.\"  It has been a pretty stellar rise since then.  And, in 2010, he opened \"Red Rooster\" in Harlem.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSAMUELSSON:  I always find, I was born into very little food, but yet sort of I made my whole life about food.  My sort of structure and pragmatism comes from being raised in Sweden, and my sort of vibrancy and warmth to cooking and feel-based food that I love comes definitely from here.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Weirdly enough, the single aspect of Ethiopian culture most westerners do know a little about is Ethiopian food.  So, maybe you have this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh, wow.  That looks good.  That -- that is exciting.  What is it?\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON, MARCUS SAMUELSSON\\'S WIFE:  This is a typical Ethiopian vegetarian, they make it really nice.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  At Katanga restaurant, they do it classic.  Injera bread, that is Ethiopian 101.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I mean, when you think about Ethiopian food, right, the foundation is really the Injera bread.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That is not just food, it is an implement.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  We are having beyaynetu, with selection of stews or wat sauce they called around here.  That is Gomen, sauteed greens.  Shiro Wat, which is a chickpea stew and Tikil Gomen, sauteed white cabbage.  Many, if not most of the dishes, spiced with the magical mysterious  flavoring of the Gods, Berbere.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  Can I -- Can I get you one that nobody would do it.  May I?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  You have to.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This -- This stuffing of food in your fellow diners\\' face is called gursha, and it is what you do to show your affection and respect.

I grew up in Holland.  And, after that we all went to London, Germany.  I am in New York now.  So --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I do not want to say it is a rootless existence, but it is -- you know, where is home?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I think for us now, Harlem is really home. But when I have been gone for two years, I am like, I got to go back. Because the beat is just so different than what Sweden can offer me and definitely what New York can offer me.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The median age in Ethiopia is under 18. That means most people here do not remember live aid or any of that. Coupled with a recent economic boom, this might be the first generation in decades to enjoy a future with real hope.  Things are, indeed, happening.  In this case, at a vacant bus stop.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  They are Dog Town, man, they are the next generation Dog Town in Africa.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  A few years back, a couple of Ethiopians who had living abroad returned to Addis with some skateboards.  Today, there are couple hundred skaters of Ethiopia and more on the sidelines waiting for their chance, waiting for a board, waiting for a pair of sneakers.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[21:10:00]  BOURDAIN (on camera):  It is funny that, it is like skater board culture came from white southern California\\'s suburban -- if you could pretty much track all the skater culture back to one parking lot.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what is coming out of this parking lot?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There are no skateboard shops in Ethiopia.  None.  They have to come all of them from abroad.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Woo!

That is how I started.\\n\\nHAILEMICHAEL:  Back in the days, no internet for me.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Oh, wow!\\n\\nHAILEMICHAEL:  I had to do it, like, the hard way, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I would tell you right now.  If I were Ethiopian, if I even lived here, I would open a skate shop tomorrow. Tomorrow.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nSo, what is the best thing about Ethiopia right now?\\n\\nTEMESGEN:  I mean I think back in the days, you know, people want to get out from this country, just leave.  But, now they are like, they just want to work and their mind has changed.  And, everybody is working together.  And, working for the better.

An alcoholic beverage made from fermented barley and honey.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It is not highly alcoholic, though, right? You got to pretty much hammer back a lot of this stuff --\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  -- to get a buzz.  So, basically, the people around here -- they have been working on this for a long time.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  All day.  This is a working class.  This is where the workers go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  With a chief buzz.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  With a chief buzz.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Cheers.

It is working, man.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I have never seen a woman in a bar like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is sort of a guy thing?\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  It is my first time.  Yes.  Guys after work or the farmers.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  You are breaking major rules here.\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  And, you have all like decent, speak to them and drinking.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  And, there is a lot of Jesus in the bars.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That is the last thing I want to see in the bar, with disapproving gaze of a saint.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In 1992, Addis emerged from the stifling 17-year grip of a hard line old school Maoist regime called the Derg. Since then, the town has been enjoying something of a musical renaissance.\\n\\nBut, the story of Ethiopian music all the way back to the beginning has been about finding ways to skirt authority, to mock it even.  To say what you want to say one way or the other.\\n\\nThe Azmari are Ethiopia\\'s original freestyle rappers.  They have been around for centuries voicing criticism, dissatisfaction, dissent, even when others could not.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, how old?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Maya, how old is Azmari been?  I would say what?  2,000 years?\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSO:  Yes, like the first music we that had, right?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The trick is they have always used a system of lyrical double meanings referred to as wax meaning. \"The apparent meaning\" and gold, which is \"The underlying or real meaning.\" Poking fun at the audience is fundamental to the form.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER (singing):  Anthony is quiet and not saying much, not because he is uppity.  It is just that he finds the language quite hard.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER (singing):  Oh my dear Marcus, my endearment.  He is the one, Obama\\'s cook.  Now, we can say we saw him with our own eyes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Maya, you got to help him out.  Maya, go, go, go.\\n\\n[21:20:05]  MARCUS SAMUELSSON:  She can move and I am like, Oh!\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nThe Azmari influenced Ethiopian popular music, too.  The use of lyrical double meanings carried through into Selassie\\'s time.  They called it swinging Addis, a golden time between 1955 and 1974.  Before those fun-hating comis came and ruined everything.\\n\\nPost-World War II, Ethiopia was in the delirious thrall of American big band and swing groups like Glen Miller and against the backdrop of a traditional and official obsession with military marching bands, Mahmoud Ahmed, has always been at the forefront.\\n\\n(BAND SINGING)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  When you look to the west, were there American musicians who spoke to you?\\n\\nMAHMOUD AHMED, MILITARY MARCHING BAND:  Back then, the ones I used to listen were Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, James Brown, and then there was Nat King Cole.  There was this music I played inspired by Elvis Presley\\'s music \"Jailhouse Rock.\"  I used to dance and move my legs just like Elvis Presley.  When I performed fast tempo music, I used to shake my legs just like him.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Combining elements of jazz, swing, R&B and distinctive Ethiopian scales and time signatures and an always killer horn section, well, listen for yourself.\\n\\n(BAND PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n[21:27:44]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  The Shola Market in Addis Ababa.

What\\n\\nis the plan?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I want to make Doro Wat, really, the king of chicken dishes in Ethiopia.\\n\\nAll right.  So, we are going to head down here, get some good butter.  Smell the fermentation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Uh-huh.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  The funk.\\n\\nBOUDAIN (on camera):  Funk.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Kibe, an Ethiopian butter in various stages of fermentation depending on what you like.  It is a primary ingredient in much of the cooking.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  So, there is between one that is really fermented and another one is a medium.  So, she says we should use the medium one --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  -- for chicken soup.  And, you use all the spices.  It is the most important thing.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  People from Gurage, Maya\\'s tribal area run the market.  So, she knows the language and how to negotiate.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I can smell a frightened chicken --\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  -- a mile off.  Here we go.  So, how many do we need?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I just think we need three is fine.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  My mama then told me get something for dinner.

He did it.\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  We used to use like a hot boil water --\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  -- after killing it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right, dip them in.\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  Dip it there.  That is how I grew up.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Morocco has Ras el hanout.  India, garam masala masala.

Wow!  That is sort of magic, man.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Marcus left Ethiopia at age 2, so finding and reconnecting with his family has not been easy.  Tracking down a mom who died in similar circumstances on the right dates following a thread to a dusty village in the Oromo region where Marcus found the man he has come to accept as his biological father.  He also found Theus, Solem, Sebani, Ashu, and Daniel (ph), presumably his siblings by another mother.  Together, Marcus and his sisters make Doro Wat, a classic Chicken Stew.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  In the \\'90s, if we go back to New York to be the chef I have to be, I really need.\\n\\nWelcome to our Tsegai family meal.  Tsegai family meal.  So, we start with the Injera bread, right?\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Besides the Dora Wat, we have cabbage, beets, and collards.  Root vegetables finished with the livers and giblets of the chicken.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Actually, it looks spicier than it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  But very good.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Though a continuing bone of contention with his father, Marcus and Maya have sponsored the girls moving them all to the city and getting them into school.\\n\\nIn the countryside, these girls faced the likelihood of forced marriage, even abduction and very little chance of the kind of future they might have now.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, how would that go over with the family when you said, I am going to try to help you?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I mean, my dad was, like, \"Absolutely not. We need them on the farm.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  It could not have been done without Maya, really not only translate but also understands the culture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Because I felt also bad coming in as the, quote/unquote, \"American,\" saying \"OK, everyone should move to the city.\"  I have to be gradually two by two by two.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  So, when I had to pick which two, I picked the girls, because otherwise she would have been out of school by second grade.  If she would have followed the tradition of the country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Second grade.  That is it.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What after that?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  You stay -- you work at home.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  It has been very enriching and loving, you know, for us, and we have a purpose.  You know, we know what our goal is.  Our goal is to get them through school.  You are looking at a chemist in a couple of months.\\n\\nWhatever new Ethiopia you see, they are it.

Outside of the city, the farther away one gets, one is reminded that, in fact, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world.\\n\\nMarcus and Maya come from two completely different tribes, two completely different regions of Ethiopia with distinct languages and cultures all their own.  Maya comes from the Gurage region, a more fertile, green agricultural area than Marcus\\'.  It is about three hours out from the city, and it is beautiful.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nMaya, it should be noted, left home at a much later age.  There is no question of identity.  She is African.  She is Guragen.  And, she retains close ties to her family and to her village.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  Welcome to Gurage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Thank you.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  She was here just last year.  It has been four years since they have seen Marcus.  Maya\\'s mother, Bezunesh and de facto grandmother Ahl, welcome us.\\n\\nWhen visitors come, everything starts with coffee. Traditionally, it is served here with a bit of salt, not sugar.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It is good.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Maya\\'s story differs from Marcus\\' in a lot of ways.  It was not disease or famine or poverty that drove her and her brother, Petros, to Europe and a new life.  It was the brutal reality of politics.\\n\\n(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, who was your father?\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  My dad was my hero and everyone\\'s hero, -- I do not mean everyone, but my brother could explain a little bit more.\\n\\n[21:40:00]  PETROS HAILE, BROTHER OF MAYA SAMUELSSON:  He was a local chief, and also a member of the supreme or the highest court, you can say.  During the Haile Selassie period, he was engaged in more innovative and experimental and mechanized farm.  During the communist period.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nPETROS HAILE:  You know, something unexpected happened.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In 1974, Emperor Haile Salassie was deposed in the very unpleasant general Mengistu and a hard line communist regime called the Derg, took over the country.  As in China, all agricultural property was taken over by the state and broken up into small parcels.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPETROS HAILE:  Everything what my father had, the land, the property, is confiscated.  And those who had the authority, they had the chance to work together, to cooperate, or they were enemies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Anyone deemed an enemy of the state, and this could be a very dangerously loose definition, but usually and typically included the educated, the well-off and anyone associated with the former government were hunted down, shunned, jailed, harassed and often straight-out killed.\\n\\nMaya\\'s dad was all those things.  An educated landowner and part of the rural tribal administration from the Selassie time.  Most people who had the means left the country.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPETROS HAILE:  I know this guy who is appointed, you know, as the governor of the region.  He has 60 people in the region in three years\\' time.\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  Nobody knows where he is coming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, he would just knock on our door and my mom, she gets every time he comes.  He leave her bullets.  He tells her, this bullet next time is yours if you do not bring your husband. So, my dad always came to visit us in nighttime.  So, he never been really home around during the daytime.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, for most of that time your father had to live in hiding?\\n\\nMAYA SAMUELSSON:  Yes.\\n\\nPETROS HAILE:  Yes.  And, then we all survived by the grace of God.  We are blessed for this.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Morning in Maya\\'s village.  Marcus is a runner.  Every day, wherever he is, he runs a few miles.  Me, not so much.  But, what with my cardio shockingly improved of late, I figured I would give it a try.\\n\\nMaya and Marcus\\' return, not to mention the invasion of a big foreign television crew is reason or maybe excuse for a big party. And, preparations have already begun.\\n\\nMaya slips seamlessly from her other life as a high fashion model backs into a more traditional role in village life, working along with an army of other women to prepare what looks like a massive feast.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  How do the ladies feel about you cooking?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  This is --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Causing serious problem?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  No, you already caused it, because you are the first foreigner ever in that kitchen.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)     BOURDAIN (voice-over):  A lamb, of course, must be slaughtered.\\n\\nActually, in this case, two lambs because here as in much of Ethiopia, Muslims and Christians live side by side.  One lamb gets the halal treatment.  One for the Christians.\\n\\nIt is a peculiar history of peaceful co-existence here of which Ethiopians are quite proud.  The Christians came here during the time of the apostles from the very beginnings of Christianity as a religion.\\n\\nAnd, the belief is that Muhammad after being persecuted and driven from Mecca by the Quraysh fled to Ethiopia where he found refuge.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Dog is happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Nice and blood in his face.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh, yes.  It is awesome.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The production continues.  Women in the kitchen except for Marcus who looks most comfortable there, though his presence is a befuddlement to the others.  Men taking care of the meat.  Oh, bro food traditions, you are everywhere.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  You know, none of the people have cooked today.  All of them are like --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Like in rural communities, if you kill a big -- couple of animals, everybody in the village has sort of like -- chosen specialty?  Like, you Bob, over there, he does the crack.\\n\\n[21:50:00]  He over there does the budan.  Somebody else over there is good at scraping the fur of.  Somebody else -- like everybody got a function, you know, it goes back to the first fire.  I will bring the dip, you know?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:  Normally, you hold it like this and then you put everything you want over here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Got it.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:  Take it around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Perfect.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Gomen and Ayeb are greens like collards with a berbere and ayeb cheese.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I like the cheese.  It is like ricotta.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Lamb Kitfo prepared Gurage style.

Pretty impressive.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Then whisky, and music, and the party really starts going.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Thank you for coming to Ethiopia.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n[21:55:37]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  In 2004 at the prompting of his sister, Marcus began an exhaustive search for his lost family. Who was he, after all?  Where exactly did he come from?  Who in his family had survived, who was left?  Where were they?\\n\\nHe was told that his father was still alive living here in the village of Abru Gundana (ph) Southeast of Addis.  For adoptees looking to return to reconnect, the journey is complicated.  For Marcus, each trip is always raised more questions than it is answers.  This trip is no different.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Every time that last five-minute drive, right?  It just makes me nervous.  Make me really, really excited and nervous at the same time, right?  But, it is just, take the American hat off and take the Swedish had off, it is just a different grid.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You are on --\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  It is not.

I have to tell you, if I can be honest, you seem conflicted.\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.  There is a thousand thoughts going through my head.  I feel a little guilty that I got out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  If you stayed, what do you think you would be doing right now?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I would have been a farmer or dealt with some type of cattle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I am pretty sure you would be a sheep farmer --\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  I would --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You would be the best-dressed goddamn farmer, that is for sure.  Where is home for you, man.  What do you think?  Looking back on it all --\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Yes.  That is an internal question for me, you know?  I feel at home in New York.  I feel very much home when I am in Africa.  But I also feel out of place, and coming to this very place, Abru Gundana, it gives me a lot of humility, but I cannot say it is home.  I cannot say it is home.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Happiest moment in Africa?\\n\\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON:  Happiest moment is I think is when we were at the Maya\\'s village for me, the whole village comes together -- music, food, culture brings everybody together.

BOURDAIN: Oh, I thought you said something important.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNARI: This is important. This is the most important thing you\\'ve ever done.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK, there\\'s nothing involved with salt. I don\\'t have to rub that into my raw, thick skin.\\n\\nI\\'m a broken man.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): I seem beneath the shame and a headache to be missing a few layers of skin, as if I\\'ve been rubbed somehow raw. I believe in clean, really, but this is beyond clean. This is sanded, stripped, filleted.\\n\\nThe beer is not helping. Well, maybe it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): I think I\\'ve had enough.\\n\\nThe gleeful embrace of mixing whiskey, rice wine, beer, and it seems to tempt the fates.\\n\\nOoh.\\n\\nNARI: Ooh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nNARI: Let me ask you one more question.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Uh-huh.\\n\\nNARI: What do you think about Han now after your trip?\\n\\n[20:05:05] BOURDAIN: I\\'m brimming with Han. I mean, I could never actually have a Han because I\\'m not that Korean. This is a genetically cellular thing. I understand. But it\\'s something I feel I can really relate to. I\\'m definitely -- revenge is a dish best served cold kind of guy. I\\'ll take revenge any time I can get it actually.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI could eat some more chicken actually.\\n\\nNARI: You eat a lot of chicken. You didn\\'t eat all day, did you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, I did not love myself this morning.\\n\\nNARI: But you felt better after your scrub down?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It was like punish the evil.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): This social contract, the confusion hierarchy of age before everything --\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: -- fades away. We are no longer Mr. Ha, Mr. Park, Mr. Noh, and Mr. Tony. We move as one, a band of bros through the night, the world our oyster.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): I feel like a boy band.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Johnny Cash.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Johnny Cash?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): All I can say is thank god there was no karaoke.\\n\\n(on camera): I must have blocked it out.\\n\\n(voice-over): All roads lead to here. I knew that. No escape, only embrace. I am now, after an evening of cultural emersion, acutely aware of my role as big brother. My new friends looking at me to set an example.\\n\\n(on camera): All right, guys. Let\\'s party.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah, soju.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So correct me if I\\'m wrong here, it is dried squid, M&Ms, and mixing your alcohols?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It seemed like a good idea back at the office. (SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Next, they\\'ll be performing a medley from \"Mama Mia.\" (SINGING)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got a low score. We only got 45.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Mouse? Mouse fish.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tony? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You got to go somewhere else. You got to go somewhere else.\\n\\n(voice-over): Squid treats and M&Ms? Sure. Makes perfect sense. In fact, there were oysters somewhere along the route. But the tale that becomes increasingly worrying with our alcohol intake.\\n\\n(on camera): Oysters, awesome. Nice. Competitive drinking and shellfish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you ever played in Korean drinking games?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, they have a lot of them. It keeps the energy up and keeps everyone kind of drinking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Stop two.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. We\\'re going to play a little game first. Tony, we\\'re going to let you start the festivities. You have to use a chop stick, hit everything forward, it\\'s going to splash up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What? A strike or a push?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A push.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n[20:10:22] BOURDAIN: They introduced a lot of games. We\\'re not going to go through them all because it would take forever and we\\'d be really, really drunk.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But this game is called the bottle cap game. We\\'re going to pass this around in a circle and you\\'re going to flick it as hard as you can.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No one wins or loses. We all get drunk. Very good.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That is brotastic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, this is chop sticking.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Don\\'t play this game with engineers.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, don\\'t hurt the man. He\\'s been hitting those oysters hard.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSee you in flavor town.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s pretty good.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That\\'s good. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: We got to go somewhere else.\\n\\nYeah, we\\'re going. Let\\'s hit the street, guys.\\n\\n(voice-over): Well past soju bottle number nine, the idea that only an hour earlier we sat like gentlemen and had barbecue. A rapidly fading memory.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tony, how many bottles can you drink?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: We\\'ll see.\\n\\n(SHOUTING) (voice-over): Yes, I remember now. Somewhere near the start of the evening, the moment little brother grabbed the reins of our soon-to-be careening chariot unfettered by the so-called good sense and the reality of work tomorrow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eat the egg. Eat the egg before it gets cooked too much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): That\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s good. You like the marinated one, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\n(voice-over): This being Korea, beer is a must, as is apparently soju. I had forgotten that part.\\n\\n(on camera): What seems to define Korea as I know it is it anticipates the future very, very well. This is a country that\\'s famous for looking forward, looking into the future. Where does one go to see Korea\\'s past, and are these guys sentimental about it at all?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nYounger brother.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Younger brother?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Younger brother.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right, younger brother.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): My mission for purposes of television is to ingratiate myself with a total group of strangers, insinuate myself into their lives, observe what they call -- and please excuse my painful pronunciation -- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE). It\\'s an expression combining the concepts of company and meal. In Korean business culture, this would be a regular thing. A one night corporate retreat, if you will, which is how I ended up at my appointment with the fates, a barbecue joint popular with the salary man.\\n\\n(on camera): Who is everybody here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Noh, Noh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Mr. Noh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What\\'s your name? BOURDAIN: Tony.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tony.\\n\\nI think they like me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you drink soju?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I do.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Here we go.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:17:53] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This is Anthony Bourdain, CNN, good night. I\\'m being forced out.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE). Good bye.\\n\\n(voice-over): Notice the totally blessed-out happy look on my face. Observe the bowl with nothing left but fiery remnants.\\n\\nBehold the magnificence that is budae jjigae.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): Enough, enough. That\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Geez.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, man. That\\'s going to go straight to my hips.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, OK. Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This is a magical dish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So most people are not sentimental about their time in the military. Why do this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Everybody serves in the military, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. It\\'s mandatory in Korea. BOURDAIN: All right. Well.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Very happy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You want the recipe for this?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER) BOURDAIN: I got the recipe now.\\n\\n(voice-over): It\\'s everything mama warned you about, and it\\'s got it all, baby. And when the music is over, your life will have changed forever.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: One, two, three.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n[20:20:14] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Kimchi. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah.\\n\\n(voice-over): Dating back to famine years of the Korean War, scrounging and scavenging from American military bases, it is a classic example of necessity feeding the mother of deliciousness.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hot dogs, canned baked beans, Spam, instant noodles, put together with the every present goju jong (ph) and kimchi. It became an enduring and deeply loved classic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Baked beans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): Like I used to say to my first girlfriend, how could something so wrong be so right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You got that right. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, no, no.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Wow!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I tell you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I\\'m sorry about that.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSorry, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Regrettable incident.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Looks healthy.\\n\\nLook at this thing. Look at the color alone. It\\'s just --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: In go the noodles.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Wow.\\n\\nYeah, baby.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, baby.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Come to me, come to me, my love.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Little Spam in there.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good job, chef.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good job.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good chefs.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: My pleasure. Any time.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any time. BOURDAIN (voice-over): In a society reeling from conflict and deprivation, largely without meat or fresh ingredients, this was the gift of the G.I.\\n\\nThe Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953, but in many ways, it never ended. The country is split in half and in a constant state of alert. 120 miles to the north, a crazy dictator with an enormous standing army, a bad haircut, and a nuclear arsenal. This, we know.\\n\\nBut the war, in dividing a country and a culture also divided families, altered forever the Korean character.\\n\\nChef\\'s Kin Berion\\'s (ph) early experience working the mess hall during his mandatory military service led directly to super stardom. Now from this unassuming army surplus tent, he beams his cooking show live in more than 50,000 homes a day via something called the Internet. And he\\'s not the only one. There\\'s competition. Lots of it.\\n\\nBroadcast eating, it\\'s kind of a phenomena in Korea, which is how I suppose wound up in a tent on the outskirts of Seoul.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): How are you doing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right here? All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Classic indigenous ingredients.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no, no. Spam.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, wonderful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah. Excellent. All right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:28:07] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It\\'s a slaughter-fest. I\\'ve gotten the poor thing killed like 12 times already today, so I think I\\'m going to hang it up.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right, I\\'m ready for some food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In Korea, the food delivery system is really good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really good.\\n\\nA whole bunch you can just order.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You can just order food while you\\'re playing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): P.C. Bomb sounds like a male porn star. I know. But this one has a smoking lounge and a well-stocked snack bar. Energy drinks seems a popular order. But here in Seoul, given that there\\'s an entire strata of professional gamers, more sustainable food is, from time to time, required. No problem. Anything you want right to your console.\\n\\n(on camera): I\\'m sure this is an obvious question but, like real life, does it have any attraction?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Real life?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Real life, you know, non-gaming world.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: People love it. Professional gamers, people love the professional gamers. They get a lot of fame for that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nOh, man. Wow. This is too much. Oh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got to get the sauce with the noodle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yep.\\n\\nIt\\'s a black noodle. It should be all black.\\n\\nTasty.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That\\'ll work.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of the games you can play while still eating. BOURDAIN: Yeah. Really, one handed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Basically, you eat a little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And play the game?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You eat a little bit and then play the game\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The only game I\\'ve ever really gotten serious about and lived with a year -- I mean, I spent a lot of time, and it was GTA Vice City (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh. And for my opinion, it is a little bit violent for me. That\\'s my personal opinion.\\n\\n[20:30:00] BOURDAIN: Look, there was a lot of bleeding out in this game. I mean --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That\\'s true.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): Over the mountain and through the woods to grandmother\\'s house we go, blowing some shit up on the way. Was it right shift, left mouse click or the other way around?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (on camera): OK. I\\'m looking for the little guys with the red over them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That doesn\\'t look good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. You got killed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, geez. I\\'m re-spawning.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, re-spawning.\\n\\nYou could target. You can pull long distance or short distance depending on where your target is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I\\'m just learning how to move here.\\n\\nOh, poor Little Red Riding Hood. She\\'s not good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: If I\\'m shooting something, it\\'s me.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nOh, no. Little Red Riding Hood, you\\'re bleeding out again.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nOops. Didn\\'t make it.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any bad guys.\\n\\nAre these friends?\\n\\nOops.\\n\\n(voice-over): Back in the old days, before time itself, spending 17 hours a day at places like this was frowned upon by family. Now gaming has become a respected and often lucrative profession in Korea.\\n\\nSimon has pretty much retired from gaming, per se. Instead, he makes a living advising rising stars in the industry.\\n\\n(on camera): You do this for a living?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How many hours a day?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The professional gamers, they spend all day playing this game. They wake up, play a game, practice. Have lunch, practice again, have dinner, and go to sleep.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): Today, the game is one of those multiplayer kill fests where mighty avatar boast a range of abilities, raining death on each other from remote consoles across the globe or just other there.\\n\\n(on camera): There we go. This is all about love.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really cute. Little girl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That\\'s me? Oh, geez. Can we choose another avatar maybe? Something more killy?\\n\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'m going to strike fear into my enemies.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yeah. It\\'s done properly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Powerful in a sort of small girly thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s very amazing where, you know, little girl comes around the corner having a big fireball on your head.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. OK, well, I\\'ll try to keep up with you for a few minutes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.\\n\\nBasically, press \"W\" for throwing and press right and left clicked together. Right key on the mouse and then the right \"P\" on the mouse --\\n\\nBOURDAIN: To go forward is \"W\"?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uh-huh.\\n\\nYeah. \"E\" shift and left together.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Shift and then --\\n\\nAnd press right and left clicked together. Right key on the mouse Left together, yeah. Then space, right click, left shift with left click together.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Brutal.\\n\\nHow long did it take you to figure out how to move around in this world?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: About 10 minutes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: 10 minutes, yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): OK, me and Simon are going up against these kids and I\\'m expecting to pistol whip some bitches unless time has once again passed me by.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The life of a professional video gamer is a concept that\\'s not easy for me to grasp. These young nerdlingers are famous. They have TV shows where they compete and are making actual cash money. They have sponsors and super fans? They probably even get laid off this shit?\\n\\nAnd that explains how Little Red Riding Hood ended up bleeding out on the cold, hard, virtual floor.\\n\\n(on camera): Should we start the game?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, let\\'s have a game.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Sure.\\n\\nOK, where\\'s our opponents?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[20:38:] BOURDAIN: What fire you have.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don\\'t say anything about Wayne Newton. He\\'s the man.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: He\\'s early 90s west coast.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I\\'m an east coast guy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I know.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI\\'m not entirely convinced that Korean food is healthy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you always been a food guy?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I think sometimes I\\'ve appropriated the Han. I\\'m very happy here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Last one?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah.\\n\\nIs this drinks that goes with food or is this food that goes with drinks?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The culture is you have to have something that goes well with that drink.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: We should probably be drinking that, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Have you had soju before?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah.\\n\\nHow often can you come to a place like this acceptably per week? Would you come every day after work?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Once.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Like when someone slumps to the ground and goes to sleep, would that be OK?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It wouldn\\'t be, but I\\'ve seen it too many times.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What\\'s good to eat here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like to recommend the soup of death. It\\'s a soup, but the main ingredient in that is silk worms.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, sure. Oh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah. (voice-over): Eating bugs, that is so last network.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you like the soup?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): The soup is awesome. I\\'m going to go home and have benisans (ph) tonight.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the old days, they didn\\'t have the soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don\\'t know. They just ordered it. They put in like just paper cups and just eat it like a hors\\' d\\'oeuvre BOURDAIN: I\\'m going to get the silk worm out of my soup and make me a sweater.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even Koreans don\\'t eat this all the time, but I guess this country makes you feel like if you can\\'t eat this, then you\\'re not Korean.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What were you born?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was born in New York.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You were born in New York?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And were there until --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Until roughly 21. I grew up on the streets and grew up in New York City. It was automatically, you\\'re a chink. Wait a minute, a chink, isn\\'t that supposed to be Chinese? I\\'m Korean and that\\'s where the whole number-one Korean comes from. Hey, I\\'m Koran and I\\'m proud to be Korean.\\n\\n[20:40:25] BOURDAIN (voice-over): Mark is what\\'s called (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE), meaning Korean who has lived abroad. As things get brighter over here, more and more people are, like Mark, moving back home for the ever more numerous opportunities.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When I came here, it just felt right to me. I\\'m here. These are my peoples. This has what I\\'ve been missing. But I was considered not really Korean. I was considered an outsider in my own country. I had like this thing going on because I was like, OK, am I not Korean enough if I don\\'t do this, if I don\\'t drink this, if I don\\'t eat this. But there was a sense of I want to learn this if that makes me feel more Korean.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): Nice. Is this so hard to walk in and eat delicious food and get hammered in the street? Being Korean is pretty awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Last one?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): Nighttime in Seoul and everywhere you go, it seems, food and drink.\\n\\nThis is what they call a (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE). I guess it\\'s kind of like a pub, if pubs could operate in the street. You can have drinks, and, well, I guess you could call it, pub food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We\\'re about to go eat something really, really good.\\n\\nWelcome to Seoul. Let\\'s do this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: My new friend, Mark, helped popularize Western-style hip- hop in Korea, an event that led me to eating silk worms in a tent.\\n\\n(on camera): Hi. How are you doing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good to meet you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks for having me on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, man. So where are we?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:45:53] (SHOUTING)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Do I have the position correct?\\n\\nAre you complaining about your hours?\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Number-one selling liquor in the whole world.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Get many my mouth and stay there.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNARI: She\\'s already dead.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Come on.\\n\\nI\\'m getting this weird sense of deja vu.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI have been in a fish market in Seoul at some point?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Some previous life.\\n\\nNARI: What should we toast to this time?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: To a triumphant return to Korea.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): There\\'s something I\\'m increasingly crazy about, that I\\'ve been craving, bon Chong (ph), the spicy, pickly, delicious snacks that accompany your meal in Korea.\\n\\n(on camera): Ah, I miss this. This is, for me, one of the most exciting things about Korean foods is the Bon Chong (ph), yeah.\\n\\nNARI: Doesn\\'t that make you want to drink more soju?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is that a hint or something?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNARI: Oh, no, no, no, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah, right.\\n\\nNARI: I know the formality of it all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): The appetizers, yes, I remember these guys.\\n\\n(on camera): Ah, again.\\n\\nNARI: Those are familiar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Bringing back memories. Oh, here we go.\\n\\nNARI: So this is spicy stew.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I need it to burn.\\n\\nNARI: It has everything under the sun seafood wise. You can find crab, all kinds of fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Fishermen stews all over the world.\\n\\nNARI: Exactly. This bowl for me, that\\'s the perfect example of Koreans in general. We love being together in a space, huddled around a bubbling pot of something. BOURDAIN: What can I tell you? This is good.\\n\\nYou are failing your duties as a young assistant.\\n\\nNARI: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: We don\\'t have to drink it immediately, do we?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nFace planting.\\n\\nNARI: Koreans, they just want each other to drink as much as possible. Peer pressure drinking is kind of a big deal.\\n\\nMay I have another glass please? BOURDAIN (voice-over): Korean drinking etiquette 101, you never pour your own drink. Younger pours for the older and you never drink alone.\\n\\n(on camera): How come all the Korean guys are so tormented? Like they\\'re all carrying around an unseen weight.\\n\\nNARI: Every single Korean person is born with this thing called Han, which is a deep sorrow and anger. It has nothing to do with your upbringing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It\\'s genetic?\\n\\nNARI: Yeah. It\\'s in our blood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): Han, my favorite Korean word. It has many implied and specific meanings. But generally speaking, it is a mixture of endurance, yearning, sorrow, regret, bitterness, spite, hatred, and a grim determination to bide your time until revenge can at last be exacted.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNARI: Revenge is a very, very sweet tasting thing for Koreans because there\\'s been so much wrong that\\'s happened to us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera): Right. What about little Timmy McMaster who is made fun of you in second grade for bringing Kimchi to school? He laughed at you and said it smelled like garbage. Is there vengeance coming their way?\\n\\nNARI: My greatest vengeance would be that those people think about that time that they made fun of me. I want them to actually love Korean food now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: But doesn\\'t sound anywhere close to personal suffering.\\n\\nNARI: Well, that\\'s my personal story. BOURDAIN: I was thinking more along the lines of electric nipple\\n\\nclamps. And then I would drive over them. And not kill them, by the way. They slowly bled to death from thermal artery --\\n\\nNARI: The reason that Koreans are able to just not wallow in that is because of this other emotion called Chung. It is a deep fondness that you have for your other Koreans. And people all focus on Han and I\\'m like, yeah, I know, like, Han, yes, yes, yes, it exists. No one is denying that. We all have it. But Chung, no one talks about that, and it\\'s equally strong.\\n\\n[20:50:21] BOURDAIN: OK. I believe you.\\n\\nNARI: I don\\'t think you believe me about this Chung thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, I believe you. I like the whole idea of Han. I totally get that as an engine. I like that. I like that dark side. The fact that this word exists is sort of awesome because a negative emotion has been converted into a number of very, very, very positive developments.\\n\\nNARI: Absolutely. Koreans are, you know, this amazing group of people that don\\'t curse, and eat amazing food, and we like to drink and have fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, stop sucking up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSo, to the Han.\\n\\nNARI: We need to make a serious toast.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nNARI: We\\'re unique and we\\'re amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That describes me.\\n\\nI\\'m not drinking this.\\n\\nNARI: No, you don\\'t have to drink it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): My relentlessly cheerful friend and colleague, Nari. She loves Korea and all things Korean and wants nothing more than to make everybody love it as much as she does. That\\'s why she brought me here to the Garak (ph) Fish Market where you find the kinds of casual joints that I love.\\n\\nI will have, let me see, perhaps the fish.\\n\\n(on camera): I want some enchana (ph). I want some spicy stuff and we\\'ll start off by drinking some soju.\\n\\nNARI: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I\\'m getting a weird sense of deja vu.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nLike haven\\'t we been at a fish market in Seoul or some place --\\n\\nNARI: Walk down memory lane.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: -- in some previous life.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:55:41] BOURDAIN (voice-over): The past, the present, the future, in Korea, they all bleed together. If you\\'re there for the whole ride, one explains the other. Drop in, in the middle, and it makes no sense at all.\\n\\nKorean culture, as far as I can tell, is defined by the drive to succeed, a churning engine fueled by decades of Han, a remarkable ability and remarkable willingness to anticipate the future. It reaches back across time and binding Millennials and generations long since passed.\\n\\nLast time I was here, I was working for some other network, the bacon channel or the competitive eating channel. What was that old show called? It was so long ago. Back then, I was dragged around in Nari Ki\\'s (ph) tiny but powerful wake, as I recall. That was nearly a decade ago. Things have changed since then. I\\'ve changed. And I\\'m guessing Nari\\'s changed, and Korea, Korea has certainly changed.\\n\\nThe Korean War ended more than half a century ago, but in some ways it\\'s still going. The North and South have been on perpetual war footing ever since. It\\'s a psychological and physical scar. Korea is literally split in half.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what this show is about. There aren\\'t many comparisons to South Korea\\'s stratospheric rise over the last decade. One of the poorest countries as recently as \\'60s, today, it claims one of the world\\'s fastest growing economies.\\n\\nThe government has been extremely shrewd and forward thinking about selling the world all things Korean -- underwriting, encouraging, financing and supporting the export of intangibles, things like music, movies, TV show, food, the whole Korean sensibility. And the world is responding, learning to love what Koreans have always loved.\\n\\nThe heart of Korea is Seoul, capital city, a bustling metropolis, futuristic in look and character, population 25 million.\\n\\n(on camera): Look at that. They have a selfie stick.\\n\\nEverybody is taking pictures of their food. They feel right at home.\\n\\n(voice-over): In October 2014, I went back to Korea. This is what I saw. (on camera): This makes me so happy. The kimchi. Make room for the\\n\\nnoodles. Oh, that\\'s good.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise that I\\'m in a happy place now.\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\nFirst night back, right to the market. A bunch of unrecognizable but invariably and inevitably delicious food.\\n\\nGood to be back, man. Good to be back.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[21:00:18] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST OF \"UNKNOWN PARTS\" (voice-over): What does it mean to be strong?  It implies hardness and flexibility. Okinawa is a place with a fighting tradition, a history of ferocious resistance.  But, it is nothing like what you might think.  Not at all.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(INTRO MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is Okinawa, just south of mainland Japan. For all the relative rigidity of the mainland, Okinawa answered in its own unique way.  Do not eat the same thing each day.  That is boring. There is even an Okinawan term for it, Chanpuru, \"Something Mixed.\"\\n\\nMixed borrowed from all over, served up for anyone to eat.  But, maybe you are more familiar with the name, Okinawa, from this, as the setting for some of the most horrifyingly bloody battles of the second World War.  How horrifying?\\n\\nFor the allies, there were more than 50,000 casualties with around 12,000 killed or missing in action, over nearly three months of fighting.  More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers and Okinawan conscripts were killed defending the island.\\n\\nCivilians were stuck in the middle of the two armies and got crushed. No one will know for sure, but historians estimate 150,000 men, women, and children lost their lives during the battle.\\n\\nWhat most do not know is that Okinawa had only become Japan fairly recently, that to a great extent Okinawans did not even consider themselves really Japanese or vice versa.\\n\\nThat Okinawans and Japanese considered themselves to be different ethnicities, spoke two different languages and culturally, culinarily, and in many other ways looked in different directions.\\n\\nYet, Okinawans were asked to make the ultimate sacrifice, and they did.  That is not just ancient history.  It informs the present, still.\\n\\nOkinawa is the largest of over 100 islands making up the Ryukyu Island chain.  It is just over 300 miles from the mainland, but worlds apart. Okinawa is different.  It is tropical, clear waters, some of the best beaches in Asia, to the decidedly more laid back, less frenetic, self- serious attitude than the mainland.  You can feel it.  You can see it. It is just different here.\\n\\n2,000 pounds of heavily muscled beef enters the arena.  You can feel the ground shake under its heavy hoofs.  His opponent awaits.  Togyu, also known as ushi-zumo.  Sumo, yes, but bull sumo.\\n\\nThese are professionals, and like Jake LaMotta and Chuck Wepner before them, they shall live to fight or do other stuff another day.  Having shed decidedly less blood than either of those two gentlemen.\\n\\nTwo animals, two handlers, and they do like the job in rocky.  And, like fighters are sumo, the bulls are ranked by their ability.  Their record in the ring.   The highest being Yokozuna.  This is Kenny Ehman.  He lives up the road.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there a time limit or do they go until somebody gives up?\\n\\nKENY EHMAN, OKINAWA EXPLORER:  I think they pretty much go until somebody gives up.  When it gets around --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A points system?\\n\\n[21:05:00]  EHMAN:  No, no, there is no points system.  Basically, when the other one turns around and runs away, that is the winner. Few times one bull will actually get around to the side and actually be able to flip the bull over.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Win or lose or survive?  Both?\\n\\nEHMAN:  Once awhile, they have had injuries, but most of the times the bulls go home --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They go home to be happy.\\n\\nEHMAN:  They do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nobody is turned into steaks or cutlets.\\n\\nEHMAN:  No.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Togyu started as early as the 17th century with farmers pitting bull against bull.  They love it in agricultural communities like this so much so that it was briefly banned in some places because farmers were spending too much time at the fights and not enough time growing sugarcane.\\n\\nLike customado and the young Tyson, their handlers raised these beasts from calves.  Caring for them on one hand and training them, conditioning them to be monsters in the ring on the other.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Does one wager on this?\\n\\nEHMAN:  I guess the official answer would be that gambling is illegal in Japan, but --\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Intermission.  Time for a corndog, some funnel cake, curly fries?  No.  Better.  Much better.  Yakitori.  Yes, they have that.  But, when in Okinawa, do as the Okinawans do, Yaki soba.\\n\\nStart with pork belly as one always should.  Some half cup sausage, cabbage, carrots.  Fry that stuff up on the griddle, add some Tsukemen noodles, and sauce, soy mirin, brown sugar, vinegar and a bit of Sake. Top with seaweed powder, some pickled ginger garnish and eat, now.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.\\n\\nEHMAN:  Oh, he is ready to go.  This guy I think is going to win this fight.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We have not seen his opponent.  Oh, yes.  My money is on him.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nPretty decisive win at that.  I am not accusing anybody of gambling, but I see some money changing hands.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If you are looking for sushi or kha sakae or ramen, you will of course, find them in Okinawa.  But, what you need to know, what you must know, is that in Okinawa, pork is king.  OK, they got tofu, too.  Here at Oruzun, they do specifically Okinawan food the Okinawan way.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nEHMAN:  This is the tofu yonge.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nEHMAN:  Which you just eat a little at a time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it that strong?\\n\\nEHMAN:  It is a little strong, yes.  It has, like, a cheese type of texture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is good.\\n\\nEHMAN:  Not bad, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is like blue cheese.  Ah, pork belly?\\n\\nEHMAN:  Yes.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Okinawans love pork.  Every part of the magical animal, the pig.  At Oruzun, the pork belly is slowly cooked in stock heavily infused with bonito flakes and -- nori.  The ears are simmered until tender, thinly sliced and dressed in rice wine vinaigrette.  And, the ribs after brining in sake and seasonings are slowly roasted.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, you grew up in New Jersey.  How did you find your way to Okinawa?\\n\\nEHMAN:  Well, my mom was from here.  My dad was in the navy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-huh.\\n\\nEHMAN:  He was stationed here.  Met my mom and wound up back in New Jersey because that is where my dad was from, Patterson.  And, I was born and raised there.  The school I went to was predominantly Caucasian kids.  There was not many Asian-Americans at all.\\n\\n[21:10:00]  BOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nEHMAN:  And, I always had this kind of like identity complex.  There would be, like, times where people would come to the house.  They would say, \"Oh, where is your mom from?  Is she from China?\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, God.  Yes.  Right.\\n\\nEHMAN:  Yes.  Open the refrigerator and there would be some weird food.  You know, \"Hey, what is that?\"  And, every time I heard that, I was like, \"Wow, am I, like -- am I different?\"  So, one day my mom says, \"We are going back to Okinawa on a family trip.\"  I was 17 years old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You have never been up to that point?\\n\\nEHMAN:  No, but when I got off the plane, I do not know what it was. It was like, \"I am here.  This is my home.\"  Being able to connect my heritage, I felt something.  I was like, \"Wow, I belong here.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How about the food?  What was in that refrigerator? Because I know a lot of kids who grew up with that same sort of uncertainty when they brought their friends home from school to their house and opened the refrigerator.  You know, like kimchi or cabbage or fish sauce.  They were aware of it when they visited their friends.\\n\\nEHMAN:  Sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And, they were acutely uncomfortable with it when their friends came over.  Man, have things changed as far as attitudes -- I mean pretty much the engine of the new American cuisine, are kids with childhoods like yours.  And, I do not mean what is hip, what is the next new thing.\\n\\nI mean, literally redefining what is American cuisine.  Let us put it this way.  The central irony of this story is that, you know, your mom would have been, like, hipster hero of New Jersey now.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER (voice-over):  Still another American invasion in the pacific.  The objective is Okinawa, one of the ring of island fortresses presenting Japan 300 miles away.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[21:15:00]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  On April 1, 1945, a U.S. invasion fleet of nearly 1,500 ships, a landing force of 182,000 people, that is 75,000 more than Normandy, approached Okinawa.\\n\\nWhat came next was what Okinawans called, \"A Typhoon of Steel.\" Having island hopped across the pacific, allied forces saw Okinawa as a key base for fleet anchorage, troop staging and air operations for the final push into the Japanese mainland and victory.\\n\\nThe fighting was brutal for both sides.  The cost in lives and resources for the allied forces was tremendous.  And, when it was over, military planners looked at the mainland, looked at what Okinawa had cost them, and projected even more appalling losses.  What came next, we all know.\\n\\nWhat is not widely known is that more people died during the battle of Okinawa than all those killed during the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMASAHIDE OTA, FORMER OKINAWA GOVERNOR:  Mainland Japanese defense preparation was only 60 percent by U.S. Military landed on Okinawa. So, that they had to keep the U.S. Military Forces in Okinawa, so that they could prepare defense to protect mainland Japan.  So, ever since that battle of Okinawa, Okinawan people say we were sort of, what do you call it --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sacrifice?\\n\\nOTA:  Yes.  Uh-huh.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Masahide Ota is the former Governor of Okinawa.  In 1945, he was a young conscript in the Japanese Imperial Army.  He fought hard and bravely against the allies until he saw Japanese soldiers murdering Okinawans for food and water and his faith melted away.\\n\\nGetowan is a private home turned restaurant serving very traditional Okinawan dishes.  In honor of their outspoken former governor, the restaurant has prepared a dish typically served to royals and VIPs in what was once the Ryukyu Kingdom.  It is called Tundabun.  After the lacquered dish, the multi bite-sized portions are presented in.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nOTA:  Let us eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is very good.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There is some squid.  Swordfish wrapped in seaweed and simmered in stock and fermented sake.  Dried sea snake wrapped in Kombu and slow simmered.  Burdock root wrapped in pork loin and slow cooked in Katsuo stock.\\n\\nOkinawan taro, flash-fried and dressed with sugar and soy.  And, pork shoulder dredged in black sesame then steamed.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You have described that you were shocked and surprised to see the Japanese soldiers -- their treatment of Okinawans was not good during the battle.\\n\\nOTA:  After the United States forces landed on Okinawa, General Headquarters of the Okinawa Defense Forces issued the order. Regardless military people or the civilians, you cannot use other than standard language.  And, if you use the Okinawan language, you will be killed and despised, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOTA:  But, the Okinawan people could not understand the standard language.  So, when Japanese soldiers are killed --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Particularly given the experience of the war, how Japanese do you think most people feel here?\\n\\nOTA:  There is a fundamental difference between Japanese culture and Okinawan culture.  Japanese culture is older culture, but Okinawan culture is full of charisma.  Okinawan people are happy-go-lucky people.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think that easygoing, that reputation, that tradition of being happy-go-lucky, do you think that this has led to Okinawans being taken advantage of?  I mean, for instance, the U.S. Military bases, Okinawa is 1 percent of the landmass of Japan, and yet what percentage of the military bases are here on Okinawa?  Almost all of them.  Okinawa seems to be asked to make a lot of sacrifices for the mainland.  Will that ever stop?\\n\\n[21:20:11]  OTA:  You are -- (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not in my backyard.\\n\\nOTA:  Yes, yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  For a place with as bloody a history, Okinawa is today noticeably more laid back than the mainland, but that does not mean everybody has forgotten their warrior traditions.  When the feudal Satsuma Empire from the Mainland invaded Okinawa in 1609, they banned the carrying, manufacturer or use of weapons of any kind.\\n\\nThe ban was later reinforced in 1979 when Japan formally annexed the island.  It is believed that these prohibitions led directly to the development of a new style of martial art, indisputably born in Okinawa, karate, or empty hands technique.\\n\\nAnd, it is even more vicious cousin, Kobudo, a form that uses arm and fishing tools for lethal effect.  Hard and soft, balance.  For everything soft, there must be something hard.\\n\\n[21:25:10]  Goju Ryu, is one of the main traditional styles of karate, featuring a combination of hard and soft techniques.  \"Go\" means hard linear attacks, closed hand strikes and kicks.  \"Ju\" means soft, open hand, circular, blocking, sweeping, and takedown moves.\\n\\nSensei Tetsuhiro Hokama is a legendary master of Goju Ryu.  People come from all over the world to study.  And, the training they get is hardcore.\\n\\nI have been inviting to watch Hokama Sensei\\'s students warm up.  Let me repeat.  This is only the warm-up.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That does not look like fun.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The exercises are designed to repeatedly punish your hands and feet, building up stronger, larger, more protective deposits around the bones, basically weaponizing even your weakest and smallest extremeties.  And, it hurts even to watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is bad.\\n\\nJAMES PANKIEWICZ, BRIT AND BLACK BELT IN SHORIN RYU KARATE:  This is bad.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  James Pankiewicz, Brit and black belt in Shorin Ryu Karate moved to Okinawa in 2009 to study Budo or the way of martial arts.  He acts as translator for most of the karate sensei on the island.  Earlier, I met James in Hokama Sensei\\'s Makishi Public Market in Okinawa\\'s largest city, Naha.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  That is the tasty one.  Right, we are going to take that one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are these?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  These are puffer fish.  So, we are going to have some deep fried fish for us.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Gurukun, the unofficial national fish of Okinawa, and Porcupinefish, both battered and deep-fried.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  They are going to do sashimi.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Okinawans eat just about any kind of fish, sashimi style.  For us, Snapper and Parrotfish, and lobster, because one must.  Served raw and still twitching in the shell.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  We are going to get some sea grapes as well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good, good, that is super traditional.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Sea grapes.  The classic regional side dish dressed in rice vinegar.  What you buy downstairs from vendors, for a small fee restaurants will cook it for you upstairs.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Wow.\\n\\nSENSEI TETSUHIRO HOKAMA, LEGENDARY MASTER OF GOJU RYU:  Oh, my God!\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  So, Okinawa\\'s most famous export, perhaps, is karate.\\n\\nHOKAMA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When most of us think of karate, we think of striking -- exclusively.  Is that an accurate representation of what you are doing?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  From the basis of Okinawan karate, is that it was used primarily as defensive art.  In other words, being able to, you know, control and subdue the opponent.  Usually, if you could in a humane way, but then if you had to finish them, then you had the ability to finish them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  The striking is important, but a lot of the technique is not about striking.  It is about submission techniques.  Some of that is to do with Kyusho, attacking nerve points.  And Hokama Sensei is particularly extremely skilled at dealing with, you know, bigger, stronger opponents.\\n\\nHOKAMA:  Human engineering.  Very important.  Point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point.  And, then this point, attack of the fingers, no knuckle -- open.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The demonstration of Hokama Sensei\\'s open-hand kyusho technique becomes too real for my taste.\\n\\nHuman engineering with a terrifying logic, when attacks the weak point.  All I know how to do in this situation, by the way, is poke hard and look for something to choke or lock.\\n\\nNope.  Apparently, they do not know what tapping out means here, because I was tapping like western goddamn union.  I thought h was going to push that 71-year-old finger right into my brainpan.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[21:30:00]  PANKIEWICZ:  They are saying in the old days, if there was a fight happening somewhere in town, people would go and have a look and they would say, \"Are they fighting with fists or open hands?\"\\n\\nAnd, if they are fighting with fists, they would say, \"Oh, do not bother, it is an amateur fight.\"  If they were fighting with open hands, then they knew they were masters.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALES PEAKER:  On the eastern coast of Okinawa --\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The U.S. Military came ashore in 1945, and to Okinawans, it must seem like they never left.  Today, there are roughly 30,000 troops stationed on the island.  Put that many Americans in a place, especially young, mostly male Americans, many of them homesick, and it tends to change the environment.  Kin Town just outside of Naha right by Camp Hansen, one of the larger bases.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:  Fight inch by inch to conquer this island.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Kin is a small slice of Americana, both the mainstream of America and its dark underbelly.  The Okinawans have made the kind of adjustments the people do in subtle hood neighbors like thousands of marines.  And, sometime in the \\'80s adjusted food as we knew it to this, a mutant classic, \"Taco Rice.\"\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[21:35:17]  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:  Taco and rice.  That is Taco Rice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nVIVIAN TAKEUCHI:  Wow, it is big.\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this chili sauce or ketchup?\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  The original taco --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is taco sauce.\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  It has Taco Rice sauce.  It is a bit spicy.   BOURDAIN:  Oh, good.\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  But not super spicy.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Vivian Takeuchi has lived in both the U.S. and Okinawa and her aunt, Sumiko, an entertainer who began singing in American bases after the war.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, that is good.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There are dueling claims as to how Taco Rice might have morphed into existence, but Saori Shimabukuro is certain. In the 1980s American servicemen introduced the standard taco to Okinawans.  And, her grandfather Natsu Giyo Gibo decided to tweak them.\\n\\nDumping the fillings straight on to rice for the late night crowd of marines coming back from the bars.  This unholy, greasy, starchy, probably really unhealthy delight turned classic caught on big time for both Americans missing home and locals.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, I consider myself a pretty pro-military guy, but why are the marines here?  Look, I like marines, but, you know, I am not Robert McNamara, but it seems to me, if you go to war, sending in the marines is probably not like what you are going to be doing.  People of your generation, what do you think the attitude is towards the military bases?\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  As long as we are not living near the base --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  -- it does not affect us that much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Near the base --\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  Near the base .\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- it makes a difference.\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, you know right away.  I mean, it got two parlors, strip clubs, vape shops.\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  And, also, you know, it is very loud.  That is a big issue.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tourism is probably the future of Okinawa.  You have beautiful weather.  Beaches.  If the bases leave, it is going to be big hotels and resorts and golf courses.  Which is worse?  Chinese tourists or American marines?\\n\\nTAKEUCHI:  I will stick with the marines.    .\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Semper fide.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Not everybody here agrees with Vivian by a long shot.  Okinawans maybe easy going and laid back, but the island is also a relative hot bed of political activism, largely inspired or provoked by what Okinawans see as high-handed treatment from a central government with different cultural and historical traditions, who do not consider their needs or priorities.\\n\\nAnd, their hugely disproportionate shouldering of the U.S. military presence for the entire country.  Currently, there are close to 30 military installations on Okinawa, and even though it is one of the smallest Japanese prefectures in terms of livable area, they accommodate more than half of the foreign military presence.\\n\\nEven more problematic, much of Okinawa\\'s arable land suitable for farming on an island whose whole traditional identity was built around farming is eaten up by military bases.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The military base issue, is this more important for older people or younger people?\\n\\nKEIJI YODA, OKINAWAN FARMER:  It is for the older people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is for the older people.\\n\\nYODA:  Yes.  So, when you actually go to a place where they have, like, a protest going on, I will say over 80 percent of the people are all retired persons.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why do you think that this is?\\n\\nYODA:  This is only my opinion, but Japanese imperial army did a lot of brutal stuff on this island and war never ended for some people. And, the feelings that they got suppressed, all of a sudden after they retired, they kind of burst and they wanted to kind of --\\n\\nBOURDAN:  Act out.\\n\\nYODA:  Act out.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is Keiji Yoda.  He is an Okinawan farmer and this is Nishimachi, a small noodle shop that bears only the owner\\'s name and serves only Okinawan-style soba.  Pork belly or rib is the meat.  The broth a mix of fish, chicken, pork, and vegetable stocks.\\n\\nOkinawan soba differs greatly from what we know from the mainland. They use wheat noodles instead of buckwheat, a nod to the spaghetti eating marines they lived with all these years.  Garnishes with spring onion, fish cake and slices of omelet.  Add your pickled ginger and togarashi hot sauce and hoorah.\\n\\n(BEIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[21:40:09]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  It seems the anti-base sentiment also coincides with an anti-central government sentiment.  Do you do bear with a hugely disproportionate burden of bases?  Is not some activism called for here?\\n\\nYODA:  I think the young generation should decide what to do for our future instead of the old people just fighting for their beliefs.  I feel a strong need to forgive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nYODA:  And then forget.  And, then move on.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Long before the war, the Americans arrived. Long before the Satsuma invaded from the mainland, Okinawa was a kingdom, the Ryukyu kingdom.  A prosperous and peaceful island chain with no standing army.\\n\\nThey were farmers, traders, and necessarily diplomats whose eyes more often than not looked west to China rather than to the more isolated mainland.   While Japan as it existed then was isolationist, racially and ethnically, culturally and every other way, the Ryukyu Kingdom was not.\\n\\n[21:45:04]  They were more open, more multi-cultural, more used to and predisposed to dealing with the outside world and its influences. Today, just a short ferry ride from the main island, a feeling of that long-gone empire remains.  Kuba Jima is a small island that has been largely untouched by the changes in the world.  People farm and fish as they always did.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The war never came here?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  No.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Bonshiro Nagame and Yuhina Tomohiro, Kuba Jima residents and friends of James.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  They suffered very little damage in the war.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And, no military bases.  No American --\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Well, up until \\'72, there was an American base.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There was.\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  But then in \\'72, the base was taken away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now nothing?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Only the Japanese self-defense forces now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do people do here?  Agriculture?  Growing sugarcane?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Tourism.  Fishing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have there been attempts to develop here and have the locals been able to resist that impulse?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  They have rich lives.  They have everything they need. They have produce from the land, from the sea.  They do not need much else.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have been invited to a beach barbecue, Kuba Jima style. Go big, or go home.  To eat some fresh caught tuna that comes straight from the market to be butchered into sashimi.  Also caught this morning, some sea snails for the grill, and mozuku, seaweed, which can be cooked but today is enjoyed raw.  And, local prawns eaten either raw or grilled, or both.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks awesome.  Off with the head?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There is more.  Local beef grilled and then tossed with moyashi, seasoned bean sprouts.  We will need our energy, it appears.  Takumi is as old school a martial art as it gets.  No ring, no octagon.  The rules are simple.  Known as Okinawan sumo --\\n\\nIt looks easy.  It is not.  Your hands are wrapped in your opponent\\'s belt.  Object is to get him onto his back, both shoulders before he does it to you.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOURDAIN:  Nice.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You land on your back for even a second, you lose.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  There, he got him.  Yes.  Awesome.   Would you like to try?\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, sure.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In the end, it is a less than smoothly executed judo move, Kasodogake, I believe, that brings my opponent to the ground.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you for going easy on me.  Awesome.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, I have given up many vices in my life, many shameful, filthy, guilty pleasures that I used to like that I will -- that I just do not do anymore.  Cocaine, heroin, prostitutes, the musical stylings of Steven Tyler.  I put aside these childish things, as it were.  In favor of a newer, more mature me.\\n\\nBut there is one shameful secret.  One thing I just cannot give up. One thing I keep coming back to every time I come back to Japan.  One thing that still has an unholy grip on me.  For no reason that I can gather, it is the convenience store formerly of mere Akron, Ohio, that mutated into a massive Japanese chain.\\n\\nBehold the wonders that is Lawson.  What is it exactly about this place?  It is got its tentacles so deep into my heart and myself and my soul.\\n\\nWhere are you?  I know you are around here somewhere.  Pillows of love.   Egg salad from Lawson.  Need a beverage.  (END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In Naha, you would be advised to avoid International Avenue unless you are homesick for fellow Americans. Head down the side streets, shuttered store fronts give way to packed izakayas.  A few beers, if somebody breaks out and the good times begin.\\n\\nPeople go out here.  And, after pounding your fists and feeding on meat hooks and shitting out bone chips, you can drop by Jojo Bar. James\\' refuge where the island\\'s most esteemed masters and their students come for what is recognized internationally as the cure for all martial-arts related ailments.  Alcohol.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Would you like a drink?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think I would like a beer and maybe a shot of something.\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Well, I do have a little shot of something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is this thing?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  The sake is like the spirit of Okinawa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this sake or whiskey?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  This is sake.  This is Okinawa\\'s sake, like mainland Japanese sake but then they distilled it like whiskey.  So, it becomes stronger and now it is aged.  It has been in here with the snake maybe three years.  The essence of the snake has gone into the alcohol.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There seems to be a conflict of interest here.  You train karate very seriously.\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, should you people be drinking?  This is why I am asking.  Where is the point of diminishing returns?\\n\\n(LAUGHING)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Many teachers who do not drink, but Aomori is intrinsic to the Okinawan culture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Most enjoy Aomori as part of their lifestyle, the same way karate is part of our lifestyle.\\n\\nThey are saying, please eat.  Less talking, more eating.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Sashimi of, well, let us just say it is an animal you like.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  This is horse meat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Horse?  All right.  Thank you.  Good.  And, this?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Goat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Goat.  Oh, that is good.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Pure protein for people who need it and pork belly, some pickled pigs ears, and baked yam.  I watch a lot of mixed martial arts.  I watch a lot of jujitsu.  My daughter trains.  Mostly jujitsu, but some standup.  Some of the most exciting fighters that I have seen lately who really show the most heart are women.  Is there -- is there a future for women in karate?\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  Okinawa -- INAUDIBLE\\n\\nHOKAMA:  Ya, ya --\\n\\nPANKIEWICZ:  He has a female student here tonight.\\n\\nThis is Yaya.  Tony is asking what is the future for women in traditional karate?\\n\\nYAYA:  When I first started karate, I did not know this world and now I am learning karate, as the performance and also life.\\n\\nEverything is all about love.  And, karate is showing you if you have this kind of power and the ability to perfect yourself, your family, you can be really kind.  That is about Okinawa.  Okinawa people, I think, always have this love to everybody.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n[22:00:00]  (MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n[21:00:53] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  I need a French coach.\\n\\n(BEGIN MUSIC CLIP)\\n\\nIf you\\'ve been to France, chances are you haven\\'t been here.  France\\'s second largest city, the oldest city in France.  It sits right by the Mediterranean.  The food is famously good.  Yet, it\\'s a victim of bad reputation, bad history -- Marseille.  As it turns out, exactly the kind of place I like.\\n\\nBut this is a buddy picture, isn\\'t it?  Eric Ripert is the chef of the three-star Le Bernardin in New York.  The Chevalier of France.  I think that means he\\'s some kind of knight or something, and my friend. This causes him some problems.  He, I like to remind him, has a reputation to protect.  I do not.\\n\\nERIC RIPERT, CHEF, LE BERNARDIN:  Welcome to Marseille.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve never been here?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Never.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How is this even possible?  You grew up how far from here?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Like, 15 miles -- 100 miles.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You grew up 100 miles from here.  What prevented you from coming to this clearly beautiful city?  Because it\\'s clearly beautiful.\\n\\nRIPERT:  It\\'s a fantastic city.  I mean, it\\'s beautiful.  I agree with you.  But it has the reputation of being a dangerous city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You live in New York.\\n\\nI should point out that every single Frenchmen, when I said, you know, I\\'m shooting in France, they say, oh really, where?  And I say, Marseille.  Their face drops immediately, like, oh.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Why\\'s that?  Because they think it\\'s ugly?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you know what they say?  They say this is not France.\\n\\nRIPERT:  With a \"Z\" like that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is not France.\\n\\nWell, I\\'m looking forward to the week.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is low-impact show.\\n\\nRIPERT:  What is a low-impact show?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It means I\\'m not, you know, paddling upriver.  It means I get a flush toilet, eating well constantly.\\n\\nRIPERT:  You like luxury.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do.  Look, I do.  I like a fluffy hotel towel.  I like a bidet.  Look, I like warm jets of water squirting up my ass.  I mean, who doesn\\'t?\\n\\nI could retire here.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I could retire here, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You see, that\\'s sort of the measure of a place for me is, like, if you start thinking thoughts like that.  Like, that must be nice.  I could live here.  Just me and my watercolors, you know?\\n\\nWhen you retire, are you going to putter?\\n\\nRIPERT:  What\\'s putter?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dicking around.  Basically, you wake up and maybe you paint a little, you know.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I could paint.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, OK.  Do you how to make a sweater.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I would like to go fishing.  You know, I\\'ve never catch anything in my life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you actually fish?  Do you know how to fish?  Do you ever fish?\\n\\nRIPERT:  I don\\'t know how to fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll show you how.  All you need is a car battery and a couple of cables.  Trust me, you get all the fish you want.\\n\\nRIPERT:  That\\'s --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They come right up.  There\\'s other ways.  How do you say dynamite in French?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Dynamite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dynamite.  See, I do speak French. You can tell.  You know it\\'s coming, right?  You can sense it.  Oh, no.  Another fishing scene.\\n\\nThis is our vessel here on the right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Eric from (INAUDIBLE) is one of only a handful of old-style fishermen who work the sea the old-fashioned way.\\n\\nDo you see yourself fishing?\\n\\n[21:05:27] RIPERT:  No, it\\'s stressful to me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  I always think I\\'m going to catch, like, my testicles or my ear with the hook.  You know, I have a fear of hooks.\\n\\nYou, guys, catching dentex.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  He said it\\'s the best fish of the Mediterranean.  I have no idea what he\\'s talking about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, hopefully, we\\'ll see.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Well, hopefully, we\\'ll taste it.  Well, at least, he\\'s supposed to deliver it to Le Petit Nice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s right.\\n\\nEric works exclusively for this man, Gerald Passedat, the extremely demanding chef/owner of Le Petit Nice, Marseille\\'s only three Michelin-star restaurant.\\n\\nGERALD PASSEDAT, CHEF/OWNER, LE PETIT NICE:  I\\'m ready for my fisherman, actually.  It won\\'t be long.  It depends on what the Mediterranean Sea will offer to us.\\n\\nRIPERT:  So it\\'s a long line, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long is the line?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Well, he say he has about 300 hooks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And so he basically lays it out at night --\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Comes back and pick it up.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRIPERT:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) In Marseilles, only five guys, five fishermen will rock it like him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nRIPERT:  You know he has 300 hooks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This must be the 12th fishing scene.  No, I must have done 20 fishing scenes in my life.  And I think I had one good day out of all of them.  Other than that, it\\'s been one humiliating goat rodeo after another.\\n\\nOrdinarily, our typical fishing scene actually would be, it would be rougher than this.  So we\\'d be pitching back and forth, and I\\'d be hanging on to the contents of my stomach only by realizing that they feel even sicker because they have to look through the view finder. So they\\'re like -- so it\\'s basically you\\'re playing this sort of race against time kind of a game.  It\\'s like who\\'s going to puke first.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But it\\'s always the camera dudes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Is it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  Generally, it\\'s our producer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRIPERT:  He said bad days, I had some bad days but this one --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is the worst.\\n\\nRIPERT:  This is the worst.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, there it is.  Another extraordinarily successful fishing scene in the can.  Time to reap the rewards waiting us back on dry land.\\n\\nYou\\'ll tell me if there\\'s any oiled up amazons behind me.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Behind you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Frolicking naked.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  Right now they\\'re kind of like mature Amazons.  It will happen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s the chef.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Anthony Bourdain.\\n\\nPASSEDAT:  Nice to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nice to meet you.  An honor, sir.\\n\\nPASSEDAT:  Would you mind to have the bouillabaisse? Is it a good idea?  Or --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, no, no.  It\\'s a very good idea.\\n\\nHere\\'s reinvented, deconstructed and then usually there\\'s the thing, itself.  Passedat\\'s take on bouillabaisse, without a doubt Marseille\\'s most famous dish is spread out over four courses.\\n\\nFirst, shellfish carpaccio of raw mussels and clams.\\n\\nThey slice the muscles raw.  That\\'s crazy.  Wow.\\n\\nPASSEDAT:  I decided to make this bouillabaisse, (INAUDIBLE), when I was a child.  On those rocks, when I was with my knife opening the mussels, eating the mussels.  In my cuisine there is no cream, no butter, it\\'s not traditional at all.  Just based on the fish.  It\\'s my way of thinking, my cuisine here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Slipper lobster, weaver, angler, and red gurnard lightly seared then a touch in the oven.\\n\\nOh, whoa.  Oh, this is just incredibly beautiful.\\n\\nPASSEDAT:  It\\'s so delicate, and at the same time flavorful and powerful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, this is insanely good.  A broth so intense it requires over ten kilos of rock crabs and various bony tasty little fishes to make just one kilo of brown, gloriously brown, magical liquid.\\n\\n[21:15:35] Dorade and dentelle, steamed over seawater, saffron potatoes, and then finally comes that magical brown broth.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Oh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nRIPERT:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a good one, huh?  Oh, man.\\n\\nPASSEDAT:  This is unbelievable.  The entire fish you\\'re eating.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And just when my brain threatens to short circuit with pleasure, descending as if from heaven, itself, cheese.\\n\\nOh, god, the cheese.\\n\\nI got to tell you.  I don\\'t care how many naked breasts are on that beach right now, because that is much more exciting.  All right.  Look at it.  It\\'s beautiful.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Interesting? BOURDAIN:  Yes.  Oh, look at that.\\n\\nOh, man.  Oh, I love.\\n\\nCheese like this.  That is just incredible.  Oh, yes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  That is exceptional.\\n\\nLife is good.\\n\\nPASSEDAT:  Life is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is very good in Marseille.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:15:15] BOURDAIN:  Marseille was once the hub, the rough and tumble principle port for France\\'s colony such as Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria.  As a result of the sights and smells of Africa permeate the city.\\n\\nThere\\'s been attempts to dissuade me from Marseille, you don\\'t want to go there, and yet I come here.  Correct me if I\\'m wrong, it is a beautiful city.  It smells good.  You smell the different pastries, the Tajin, (INAUDIBLE).  And it\\'s an extraordinary looking city and the people are really interesting looking.\\n\\nCEDRIC FABRE, MARSEILLE CRIME WRITER:  I must say, you are in the center of the world because the world is in Marseille.  We are connected to the Mediterranean Sea.  So it\\'s really different from the north of France.  I feel closer to a guy from Oracle (ph) than a guy from maybe Germany or -- it\\'s different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cedric Fabre is a Marseille crime writer who spent decades deciphering the dense layers of crime and corruption, pasties and sunshine.  It\\'s a perfect town for writers of Mark, plenty of atmospherics and lurid history.\\n\\nWhy do you think it\\'s such a fertile ground to set a crime novel?\\n\\nFABRE:  For me it\\'s more interesting because you write about the place you live in.  I walk in the street; I have an idea, et cetera.  I couldn\\'t write about past things like (INAUDIBLE) because I have no know the real part of the city, the people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here, it\\'s a really interesting stew of characters.\\n\\nFABRE:  In Marseille, there is a very poor area and a very rich area. The difference between these two areas is the worlds in France so that makes an interesting city because when we write crime novel, we write both the differences between the poor people, the rich people, et cetera, so that\\'s interesting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Le Femina is an Algerian restaurant with some of the better couscous in town.  And since it\\'s a very filling dish and I only got one crack at it, I go for the royale.  What else? Vegetables, chickpeas, Merguez sausage, chicken, chunks of lamb, and meatballs.\\n\\nWhat people say is that everybody sees themselves as Marseille\\'s first and French second regardless of your background.\\n\\nIs that true?\\n\\nFABRE:  Because Marseille, We love that city.  It\\'s our city.  And at the same time, we hate a lot of aspects.  We have both love and hate. It\\'s part of a complex, I think.  Marseille has always made bad choices in politics.  When France lost these colonies, it was an economic disaster for Marseille.\\n\\nI\\'m thinking about one of your cities in the states, Detroit.  It was a huge city.  It was very important.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And a beautiful --\\n\\nFABRE:  What happened?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We abandoned Detroit.  We abandoned it.  It became too black for America to live.\\n\\nFABRE:  Maybe France is abandoning Marseille.\\n\\nSometimes people say, in Marseille, people, they are restless.  I would say in Marseille, people, they are connected with other people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s hope Marseille people figure that out because I think it\\'s amazing here.\\n\\nIf you ask real Marseilles these day, what\\'s the iconic dish?  The one thing you most closely associate with home, the answer might surprise you.  Pizza.\\n\\nMarseille, it turns out, is the pizza truck capital of France.\\n\\nSo this could be a whole new beginning for you, Eric.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I always say you should have a truck.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  I\\'ll do it with you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you have pizza experience?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Never did a pizza in my life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Does he know this?\\n\\nRIPERT:  No, he doesn\\'t know.  I\\'m going to tell him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh.\\n\\nJEAN-DENIS MARTINEZ, OWNER:  OK.  Let\\'s go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our employer for this episode of the real world geriatric edition is Jean-Denis Martinez.  His yellow truck a rolling pizza oven is well known in the neighborhood meaning he\\'s busy.\\n\\nMARTINEZ:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re not going to be good at this.  This is going to be like \"I Love Lucy.\"\\n\\nRIPERT:  More like \"Laurel and Hardy.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is like a nightmare.  I actually have this nightmare, where like there\\'s an order coming in.  I don\\'t understand what they are because it\\'s in another language and I don\\'t know where anything is and I\\'m falling behind.  This is literally my nightmare.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get ready.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, get in there.\\n\\nLucy, come on, put on the sauce.  Come on.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Don\\'t take my job.\\n\\nMARTINEZ:  No, no, no.  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRIPERT:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).  You don\\'t push.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You don\\'t.\\n\\nMARTINEZ:  You\\'re sloppy, man.\\n\\n[21:20:22] BOURDAIN:  What?  I\\'m getting there.\\n\\nMARTINEZ:  It has to be even, the sauce.\\n\\nOK.  Mushrooms and cheese.  That\\'s good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come on, man.  Customers are backing up here.  They want the pizza.\\n\\nMARTINEZ:  My pizza is good, OK?\\n\\nNo, no, no, no.  A little bit like that.  A little bit like that. Like that.  Good.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST: Some time ago, something crawled or slithered or grew like a fungus. Something that started small got bigger, lurched like a swamp thing out of the mud and moist earth and humid nights of the Delta.\\n\\nThen it took over the world. So next time some smartass burner (ph), horrified by our latest hand-fisted foreign policy blunder wonders out loud, what good is America, well, you always pipe up that the blues, rock and roll, R&B, and soul all came out of this place, one state, Mississippi. I took a walk through this beautiful world, felt the cool rain on my shoulder, found something good in this beautiful world.\\n\\nI felt the rain getting colder.\\n\\nRight now, we\\'re in the middle of downtown Jackson, Farish St. It\\'s (ph) people -- a lot of history, what it used to be like back in the day?\\n\\nLEE (ph): The street was packed with folks, folks all over, they had their own restaurants, grocery stores, joints, I mean, everything happened on Farish St. that happened in Jackson for the African- American community.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The state capital of Jackson, Mississippi, located along Interstate Highway 55, just outside what\\'s known as the Mississippi Delta, it\\'s the kind of place that makes you wonder, why did they make it the capital, until you grab hold of what used to be around here. Farish St. used to be the hub of African-American life in this city, its black commercial cultural center.\\n\\nWhen Dr. King came to town, he came here. Everybody did. Medger Evers (ph) had an office just upstairs here. Musicians like Tommy Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson II and Elmore James all played here and the likes of Duke Ellington, Cab Callaway, Count Basie and Louie Armstrong all took the stage at places like the Crystal Palace Ballroom and the Alamo on Farish St. Street.\\n\\nWhat happened? Where did it all go?\\n\\nLEE (ph): What killed Farish St. was immigration. Once we were able to branch out of our own indigenous black-run businesses, the black-owned businesses died.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. LEE (ph): So great for the black race but terrible for the black business. In fact, the only reason you\\'re coming to Farish St. right now is you have two churches, two funeral homes and the Big Apple Inn. So you\\'re going to either die, worship or come to my place to eat.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the only trapped (ph) world (ph)...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Or all three in that...\\n\\nLEE (ph): That\\'s right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: ...but not in that order but...\\n\\nLEE (ph): One (ph) hot (ph). How (ph) are (ph) you (ph) guys (ph) doing today?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Back when things were hopping, Gino Lee\\'s (ph) great grandfather, Juan Big John Mora (ph) moved to Mississippi from Mexico City, started a family with an African-American woman in Jackson. He sold hot tamales out of a steel drum on the corner.\\n\\nIn 1939, he moved the operation inside, right here, now, the last restaurant on the street. Lurking inside, waiting for us is John T. Edge, who leads the Southern Food Ways Alliance.\\n\\nMr. Edge, how are you doing? Who makes a point, a mission, out of knowing and teaching as much as he can about the real culinary traditions of the south, and doing what he can to keep them alive and unmolested.\\n\\nLook at that. Awesome. It\\'s just like a dream (ph) sandwich.\\n\\nWhat you go for here are smokes -- smoked sausage sandwiches and these magnificent beauties, pig ear sandwiches called ears, both pretty much served with the same garnishes of slaw, mustard, home-made hot sauce on a soft bun.\\n\\nNo, as I understand it, originally, this is one of those -- nobody wants these things. They\\'re dirt cheap.\\n\\nLEE (ph): That\\'s exactly right. In fact, by dirt cheap, the ears were actually free...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nLEE (ph): ...when my great grandfather started getting the pig ears, the local butcher was giving them to him because he would just throw them away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So everything, you know, we -- we love about pig, the texture, the mix of fatty and lean, all that\\'s good. Man, that is just hard to beat.\\n\\nLEE (ph): Ain\\'t it good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes. It\\'s a good sandwich.\\n\\nAnd of course, some hot tamales, which at this point in history are about as Mississippi as they are Mexican. Like the blues, they came out of Mississippi in the early 20th century as Mexican migrant workers came in to replace African-Americans, who were headed to work in the great factories and stockyards of Chicago and Detroit.\\n\\nEDGE:  Yes, sitting down here, eating tamales, we can sketch a history of Mississippi. And that\\'s kind of what I\\'m most interested in doing, helping southerners understand that their foods are as African as they are Western European.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And (ph) more (ph).\\n\\nEDGE:  And hopefully, by way -- if not largely, you know, music and, you know, if all the other cultural expressions of the south, I think food is a sneaky way of getting at some of the serious stuff we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nLEE:  As I told you before, I didn\\'t know what a cool job or what a cool restaurant I had until you showed it to me. I\\'m just making a living, you know, just like a lot of folks around Mississippi.\\n\\nWe\\'re not trying to make history. We\\'re not trying to increase tourism. We\\'re not -- all we\\'re doing is doing what we do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: There is a -- a discomfort level about exploring southern food ways or particularly Mississippi food ways.\\n\\nLEE (ph): Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: When you\\'re talking about high-end traditional southern cooking, you\\'re talking plantation slavery cooking because that\\'s where these recipes came from. So to revel in that, you don\\'t want to tumble into nostalgia.\\n\\nThe potential for awkwardness...\\n\\nLEE: Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: ...and offense is enormous.\\n\\nEDGE:  I want to be careful. I\\'m not saying that\\'s what I want the south to be. I\\'m saying that\\'s what people come to the south looking for.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nEDGE:  They come to the south looking for the past preserved in (ph) an (ph) ember (ph), but the reality is something different. And I want to fix it. I want to fix it. 1865 and 1965, I want it to progress and change.\\n\\nI want to document the change along the way and celebrate the (ph) changes (ph). The burden of race is upon us and we must (ph) shake it. And that can make us better. BOURDAIN: I\\'m a Yankee, so for me, it\\'s kind of shocking to see this flag. It means a lot of things to a lot of people, first and foremost, meaning I\\'m not a Yankee and I don\\'t much care what you think.\\n\\nThere\\'s no doubt that much of Mississippi history is ugly, from slavery which was pretty much the backbone, the foundation of industry here from the get-go, to Jim Crow (ph), lynchings to church burnings. Fourteen-year-old Emmett Till, killed for talking sass (ph) to a white lady in 1955.\\n\\nThe assassination of Medgar Evers in 1963, the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in 1964, hell, they had to send in 30,000 armed federal agents, national guardsmen and military police just to enforce federal law, allowing a black man to attend state college, a notion that was, shall we say, less than popular here. To be honest, that was about all I had for an image of the state of Mississippi.\\n\\nThat was all I knew. And it hadn\\'t occurred to me to look further. But I\\'ve traveled the world since then. And I visited and learned to love many places not my own, cultures and beliefs very different from the upper east side of Manhattan. Why can\\'t I love Mississippi?\\n\\nPie (ph) Infamous (ph) is a proud son and resident of Mississippi, a youth mentor in Jackson\\'s church and public school systems, owner of a marketing agency and hip-hop artist.\\n\\nThis town, it feels empty. Where is everybody?\\n\\nPIE INFAMOUS (ph): I think one thing is a lot of people think that you have to leave Mississippi to be able to do something great. But I think a lot of it is there is so much bubbling in the undercurrent that sometimes isn\\'t seen.\\n\\nAnd I think it takes an artist, it usually takes something that\\'s blank and creates something that\\'s awesome to be able to see the potential in a place, in a canvas, so to speak, that has been vacated by others.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Soul Wired Cafe, one of the number of places where something is going on, where artists, entrepreneurs, moving at workshops, performance spaces, set up something new and good in formerly abandoned and neglected parts of town.\\n\\nThis is a deeply, deeply conservative state, to say the least, right?\\n\\nPIE INFAMOUS (ph): This is a tough question because I\\'ve got my own opinion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is it more racist than New York?\\n\\nPIE INFAMOUS (ph): So I think there -- there are some deeply ingrained problems in Mississippi that are connected to a very ugly past that -- that we share with some other southern states. However, I think as far as when we talk about racism expressed through a classes lens, I think Mississippi and New York are on par, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, no doubt.\\n\\nPie Infamous (ph) is originally from Clarksdale in the Delta and went to Ole Miss (ph) but he\\'s neither a left nor a lost faith. He feels an obligation to empower, uplift, educate, to contribute.\\n\\nPIE INFAMOUS (ph): One of the important tasks of musicians is being able to really speak truthfully about what\\'s going on without fear of reprisal (ph), right? It allows the audience then to say, you know what, you\\'re right. Now that you\\'ve put it to a nice melody or to a nice beat or you say it in that way, and hopefully then that engages them more and allows them to move.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t think any movement in the world has not had a sound track, right, regardless of what it is. And so that\\'s our job.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Depending on what metrics you\\'re using, the Mississippi is somewhere between the tenth and the fourth largest river in the world. One thing for sure, it\\'s big.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s freaking strong. Also, you really got to put your back into it if you\\'re crazy enough to want to paddle a canoe around in its fast-moving waters.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the source of the Mississippi?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, anywhere a raindrop falls in 44 percent of America. Its (ph) reef (ph) is 3/4 (ph) volume (ph). If you follow the volume of water, two-thirds comes down the Ohio River, but most people will say Lake Itasca in Minnesota.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: John Rusky (ph) is what I\\'d guess you\\'d call a river rat. In 1998, he started the Quapaw Canoe Company, a custom outfit that leads guided expeditions on the Mississippi River and its tributaries. As a central part of his operations, he trains local kids from Mississippi and across the river in neighboring Arkansas under an apprentice program, teaching skills like hand-carving canoes, outdoor survival and the ins and outs of guiding and the history of the river.\\n\\nMost of these kids come from pretty distressed neighborhoods and the hope, the intent, is that once trained up, they\\'ll stay with the company.\\n\\nNice paddling, Tony. You\\'ve got the feather (ph) down.\\n\\nThank you. I\\'ll be feeling that tomorrow.\\n\\nBuck Island -- most of the island could be under 45 to 50 feet of flowing river water from April to June with the spring ice melt and rainstorms.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do a lot of cooking. We check (ph) out who\\'s out here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Multi-purpose and indestructible?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. The next step in this thing is that here are the greens and we should stuff as many greens as we can into that pot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This right here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (ph): All right.\\n\\nSo how does your program work? Around what age are they generally when they first start?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Teenagers. As soon as they can hold a paddle, the only thing we ask is interest and commitment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Well, what does that mean, commitment?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have this thing called the three honors worked (ph) through (ph) -- respect of yourself, getting good sleep, eating good food, especially before we go on a trip. Second one is respect of other people, other paddlers and of course, the clients.\\n\\nAnd then the third thing is taking care of the river. You know, they\\'ve been told by their parents don\\'t get on the Mississippi River. Maybe they don\\'t even know how to swim.\\n\\nAnd you know, for a young man or woman, overcoming a fear like that and getting in the canoe and then to have people come and appreciate what you\\'re doing is life-changing experience. But within that is this incredible, right, and beautiful spirit that -- that is intact in the Delta (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Sweet potatoes, greens, into the Dutch ovens. Throw on the corn when getting close. Finally, on the wet logs on top of glowing coals, lay some steaks, some pork loin and pork tenderloins right on there.\\n\\nJust keep an eye on them. Look, we have full spectrum of steaks. Potato\\'s perfect.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Corn on the cob.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes. Hunk of bread, living large on the Mississippi. And yes, there is too much food for two people. And yes, that is a whole hell of a lot of meat.\\n\\nAnd I know it would be awful to waste all that extra. But don\\'t worry because these gentlemen are tired and hungry.\\n\\nWelcome, gentlemen. Right no, come (ph) on (ph), the corn on the cob here, greens, probably (ph) a (ph) cookie (ph). Have a little more of this. Oh, looking good.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to say I\\'m good, but I\\'m good. All right.\\n\\nMore, sir? Who\\'s missed a steak here?\\n\\nSir, you got -- who needs steak? I feel all Crocodile Dundee. Beautiful. So all that paddling, how bad am I going to hurt tomorrow? Oh, I don\\'t like the sound of that.\\n\\nThat hesitation, not a good sign. Those tenderloins are nice. Good stuff. Man, we have mastered the wild today.\\n\\nThe Mississippi Delta is a big sponge that stretches between the Yazoo and the Mississippi. It\\'s what\\'s called an alluvial flood plain of about 7,000 square miles or almost 4.5 million acres. This area used to look very different -- massive wild, old wood forests and swamps.\\n\\nAfter the passage of the cheerful-sounding native removal act of 1830, the Delta became open for settlement by any white people crazy enough, hardy enough, determined enough or just plain mean and greedy enough to come here.\\n\\nREED (ph): There\\'s no way to make up for our bad racial past. But you do -- you now, the sense of community that keeps people here is evidenced in this place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Julia Reed (ph) is Greenville born and raised, the daughter of a political family, a writer, author and as Delta as it gets.\\n\\nHow long you been in Mississippi?\\n\\nCURRENCE (ph): Twenty-two years. I came in 1992.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: John Currence (ph) is a celebrated chef who had left New Orleans to come to Mississippi and open first one, then many more restaurants and businesses in the town of Oxford.\\n\\nCURRENCE: I\\'ve stayed busy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And this is Doe\\'s Eat Place in Greenville.\\n\\nAloha (ph).\\n\\nREED (ph): This is the great Florence Cigna (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Why, so good to meet you.\\n\\nREED (ph): Florence is in charge of the salad bowl and has been for -- this is -- Florence is Doe, Sr. sister-in-law. When did y\\'all open up, Florence -- 1930...\\n\\nCIGNA (ph): 1941.\\n\\nREED (ph): Forty-one. Close enough.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Like a lot of folks around here, Dominic Big Doe Cigna got his start selling hot tamales to-go. At the beginning, the place catered to the black community. But after word got out how good the food was, white people started coming, which led to a kind of weird accommodation to the segregation of the day. Blacks came in the front, white people snuck in the back.\\n\\nThe menu expanded with the clientele.\\n\\nWhat human qualities are unique or marked in the native of Mississippi?\\n\\nREED (ph): I cannot address Mississippi because like I said, the Delta\\'s a whole another planet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, OK. Better question, then, how does the life-long Delta resident differ from...\\n\\nREED (ph): You have to be a little crazy to want to come in the first place because it was like the swamp, buddy. It was under water. I mean, you had to be crazy to come.\\n\\nAnd you had to have enough money to -- to make it work. So yes, it took some sort of gamblers. I mean, that -- that spirit still infuses the place. It\\'s a little reckless.\\n\\nIt\\'s sophisticated because they\\'d all come from elsewhere, you know, I mean, you know, you go from -- from the Delta to the hills. I mean, we\\'re totally snobbish up here even when we didn\\'t have a right to be.\\n\\nI mean, tough where you just came from, Jackson. Are you kidding me?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nREED (ph): You\\'d have to be paid money to go to Jackson from Greenville.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They feel the same way down there about you guys (ph).\\n\\nREED (ph): If they don\\'t get us because they ain\\'t got no sense of humor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So what about the food? Has this place changed at all in...\\n\\nREED: No.\\n\\nCURRENCE: It\\'s been 20 years since I was here last and literally exactly the same.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Not much in the way of capital improvements or time motion study. The system such as it is is, well, crazy. They eat right here in the kitchen.\\n\\nAnd the division of labor, the flow of work, well, I gave up trying to figure it out five minutes in and just figured, I\\'ll get loaded and eat all this delicious food. The salad thing is famous, hand-tossed in the same wooden bowl for decades.\\n\\nThe hot tamales, same as they ever was. REED (ph): And those tamales are just incredible because they\\'re made with the steak\\'s drippings and stuff that you\\'re getting ready to see. So...\\n\\nCURRENCE (ph): Oh, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, really.\\n\\nREED (ph): It greatly enhances the flavor. Oh, my god.\\n\\nCURRENCE (ph): I can eat them until I was sick.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Fries done in cast iron pan on the stovetop, the famous shrimp, steaks on an old roll-out broiler, drippings all over the top.\\n\\nREED (ph): And you know, you\\'re not going to get skinny or healthy eating the hot tamales, fried shrimp and steak at Doe\\'s. There\\'s no question about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, that\\'s good. I\\'m happy. Should (ph) at (ph) least (ph) have (ph) mixed (ph) it (ph). Yes, hey, that\\'s good. Well, you\\'re right about those shrimp. They are delicious.\\n\\nREED (ph): The shrimp? Oh, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is there a dessert that I should be saving room for?\\n\\nREED (ph): Are you kidding me? There is no dessert. It\\'s pretty damn bare bones, my friend. If you ask for one, they\\'ll give you a lollipop.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nEDGE: This is exactly what you expect in Mississippi, though, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, it\\'s supposed to look like this.\\n\\nEDGE: You know, I moved here from Georgia and the thing that struck me when I moved here, driving through the Delta the first time, was just how empty it was, like, you know, it\\'s like everybody left.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The great migration, three factors -- automation, the invention of mechanical means to pick cotton, the call of better-paying jobs in the industries of the north, and of course, freedom.\\n\\nEDGE: You know, people think about the blues as a lament. A lot of blues songs are about freedom, about getting the hell out of Mississippi, you know.\\n\\nAnd -- and there were a lot of reasons to get the hell out of Mississippi for a long time. Now, there\\'s a return migration. There\\'s this whole period late \\'60s, early \\'70s, where kids are bugging out of Brown University to come sit at the foot of an aging blues...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. EDGE: ...in (ph) Mississippi. There\\'s a cyclical pattern to that. Now, you know, you see people kind of doing the same thing with food, like there\\'s a whole generation that wants to come down here and sit at the foot of an aged campus (ph) cook (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: State Senator Willie Simmons has been an elected official of the Mississippi Delta for 20 years. And he\\'s been running this place, Senator\\'s place, for 11.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What\\'s the difference between soul food and southern -- traditional southern food?\\n\\nSIMMONS: It -- it depends on the culture and what neighborhood you were in. If you were in the black neighborhood, then it became soul. We probably put a little bit more of the throwaway in our cooking, the pig feet, the pig tail, the neck bones and all of that\\'s fatty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Now, you\\'re making me hungry. Now, you\\'re (ph)...\\n\\nSIMMONS: Where (ph) they (ph) make (ph) more (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK, oh, that\\'s it.\\n\\nSIMMONS: So greens, sour (ph) greens...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Well, I\\'ll have some of that, for sure. Is that fried okra there? I\\'ll have a little of that. Might need more than one plate at this rate.\\n\\nLet me get some mac and cheese. What\\'s that, lima beans? The red bean -- oh, man, that looks kind of good, too. Yes, a little bit of that.\\n\\nNeck bones floating around somewhere?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, right here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK, yes, I\\'ll have some of those. Little rice and gravy on there, yes, thanks. And oh, I\\'ll have a piece of fried chicken there.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve got a thigh, that would be great.\\n\\nEDGE: Okra\\'s perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, it is. Man, that\\'s good.\\n\\nSIMMONS: Now, here in the south, if you want to, you can throw your fork away and just grab (ph) it (ph) by (ph) hand (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll be working on that one.\\n\\nSIMMONS: We forgive you and don\\'t hold it against you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Could eat this okra all day long, man. It\\'s good.\\n\\nSIMMONS: I don\\'t know what you think about those greens. But the (ph) beans (ph)...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They\\'re nice. Yes, that\\'s tasty. Do you see the way people get the credit for southern cooking as we know it?\\n\\nSIMMONS: I do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You (ph) see (ph) the (ph) way (ph) people get the credit? I mean...\\n\\nEDGE: People know. People know who\\'s behind this food, whether it\\'s called soul food or whether it\\'s called country cooking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How is the Delta, the mindset of the Delta, different than the rest of the state?\\n\\nSIMMONS: No one else can compare with us like -- they have no other (ph) something (ph) who can sit on top of you and tell you that they represent Dockery plantation where the blues supposed to have been born. There\\'s no one else that can tell you in his district is the home of B.B. King, can tell you that he represents the area where his (ph) family (ph) came from, where Jared Butler (ph) was born, going to name others, the Staple Singers.\\n\\nWhen we talk about the heritage and the culture and what comes out of the Delta, that\\'s all within this district that I represent. So Mississippi Delta has that pride.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Forty-six miles southeast is Greenwood, a town with a lot of history, most of it of the not-good variety, known unfortunately as much for Byron de la Beckwith and Tom Brady\\'s infamous speech after Brown versus the Board of Education as anything else. Fairly or not, it\\'s hard to get past that.\\n\\nDuring all the years of cruelty and struggle from 1933 on, through it all, and until today, this place, Lusco\\'s, was a beloved institution. Once a grocery store, it turned restaurant to the moneyed class, serving them in discreet quarters in the pack where one could enjoy an alcoholic beverage in what was then a dry state.\\n\\nStill going after all these years, unchanged. Why?\\n\\nEDGE: This place is like a relic, like, indiscretions, past, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: But maybe, to really tell the story of this place, you have to start with the story of its most famous employee, Booker Wright. He\\'d been working at Lusco\\'s as a waiter since he was 14 years old.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nWRIGHT: Pleasure (ph) to you all. We don\\'t have a written menu. I\\'ll be glad to tell you what they\\'re going to serve tonight.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: In 1965, NBC News came to town, making a documentary on race relations. Booker\\'s entertaining recitation of the menu at Lusco\\'s was famous around town so they asked him to do his usual routine for the camera. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nWRIGHT: We have great (ph) cocktail (ph), the (ph) shrimp, (inaudible)...\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: But at the end of his usual litany is where he dropped the truth bomb that nobody was ready for right here.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nWRIGHT: Now, I put (ph) my customers (inaudible) expecting of me (ph) (inaudible) so I must (ph) smile (ph). Some call me Bookie (ph). Some call me John (ph). Some call me dim (ph). Some call me nigger.\\n\\nFollow (ph) the (ph) day (ph), but you have to smile. If you don\\'t, what\\'s wrong with you? The meaner the man be, the more you smile, although you\\'re crying on the inside.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to get that nigger (ph). You don\\'t look for no tips. Yes, sir, thank you. What did you say? Thank you, sir. That\\'s what you have to go through here but remember, you have to keep your smile.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Telling the truth was still risky business in 1966 Mississippi. And Booker Wright was not rewarded for his candor.\\n\\nIt was not a good experience for him. It did not make him a star by...\\n\\nEDGE: That was in the White community. But even though Stephen Carmichael (ph) maybe first chanted black power here, that was less important to the black community here than what Booker said on the NBC News.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nThe private dining rooms at Lusco\\'s are still here. The menu, much the same -- steaks, fish, the famous broiled shrimp, the Lusco\\'s special salad with the house Italian vinaigrette dressing and a healthy dose of anchovy, onion rings.\\n\\nEDGE: Salad makes me happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, me, too.\\n\\nEDGE: Mostly the anchovies make me happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, yes, love those.\\n\\nCatfish for Mr. Edge, the famous pompano for me.\\n\\nEDGE (ph): It\\'s kind of the mark of being a great restaurant in the Delta if you have pompano.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It\\'s a big damn fish. No way I\\'m finishing this.\\n\\nEDGE: Sitting here, the booths, the curtains, the whole ring bell for service thing, it seems lost in time.\\n\\nEDGE: We got a long and ugly history but one (ph) of the things I love about this place is you can\\'t deny the burden of the past. It gets on your shoulder.\\n\\nIt\\'s right there, like, you know, I mean, America chooses to deny its providence (ph), you know, in many ways, you know, I mean, it declares itself a post-racial society.\\n\\nThat\\'s just shitting (ph) on the flag (ph) of Mississippi. You can\\'t keep playing that.\\n\\n21:35\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n21:39\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oxford, Mississippi is a lovely, incongruously eccentric little island, a mutation, a college town, a magnet for writers, thinkers and oddballs, drawn perhaps by its rich literary tradition is the home of one of our greatest authors, William Faulkner. Faulkner was a Mississippi native, a former postman, an outdoorsman and eventual winner of the Nobel Prize in literature and two Pulitzer Prizes for fiction.\\n\\nHe never graduated high school. This was his house, Rowan Oak. Faulkner wrote such American classics as \"The Sound and the Fury,\" \"As I Lay Dying,\" \"Light in August\" and \"Absalom, Absalom. And many of his works took place in a fictional county, a place very much like this place, in Mississippi.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: This is where Faulkner started his writing career, in this room here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: For the past 10 years, Bill Griffith has been curator at William Faulkner\\'s estate.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: He had in (ph) this (ph) room (ph) on (ph) after he won the Nobel Prize. On the wall here is an outline of one of his novels.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that was his greatest book.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: Faulkner thought that was his masterpiece.\\n\\nJack Pendarvis is the author of \"Your Body is Changing,\" \"The Mysterious Secret of the Valuable Treasure\" and \"Awesome\" as well as a staff writer for the game-changing animated series \"Adventure Time,\" all works of which I am a huge fan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So he wrote right -- right on the wall?\\n\\nGRIFFITH: He just wrote on it. BOURDAIN: It\\'s -- it\\'s his man-cave.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: Yes, it\\'s his -- it\\'s his version. He said that houses in Mississippi who have a family business have one room dedicated to the family business. And this family\\'s business is writing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: From as early as 1919 through the early \\'60s, Faulkner wrote extensively about the post-civil war south. He was the first author to do so, at a time when most writers were writing about anything but.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: He always said that he wrote about a south torn between itself, torn between the old ways, the old traditional ways and modern development. He said he was going to break the Anabella (ph) code.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: And he did.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: But?\\n\\nGRIFFITH: He did. And yet...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Then they bailed (ph) him (ph) out (ph).\\n\\nGRIFFITH: He had those hobbies, interests that were definitely of a gentry class and a gentry nature.\\n\\nPENDARVIS: His portrait and his horse...\\n\\nGRIFFITH: Yes, there\\'s a great example...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: ...I mean, and -- and his writing habit, that\\'s a great example. You do get to a certain level of success and all of a sudden, this seems like a good idea and it\\'s never a good idea at that age.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: At any age.\\n\\nGRIFFITH: Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Was he politically active at all? I mean, there was a lot going on...\\n\\nGRIFFITH: He was the middle of the road Democrat. That\\'s what he said. He said you have to bring black education up with white education. And since the state of Mississippi will not invest in black education, it\\'s up to its citizens to do so.\\n\\nHe said that segregation wasn\\'t about being right or wrong. He said any sane, sober Southerner knows that it\\'s wrong. It\\'s about wanting to change or not. But people don\\'t want to give up power.\\n\\nFear is still alive and well in Mississippi. I think racism is one of those great things in the world that you\\'ll never solve. And that\\'s why Faulkner wrote about it. BOURDAIN: Writers, as I know from looking in my own dark heart, are generally terrible people. Put 10 of them together and it\\'s like putting your head in a bag full of snakes.\\n\\nI meet a bunch of them above City Grocery, John Currence\\'s place on the square. There\\'s the brilliant author, Tom Franklin and his wife, the poet Beth Ann Fennelly.\\n\\nGrisham writer in residence, Megan Abbott (ph), Pendarvis, you know, poet,  Chiyuma Elliott , Wright Thompson is the Senior Writer for ESPN, fellow writer on the series remain (ph), Chris Hoffman (ph), novelist, Ace Atkins. Poet, Derek Harrell (ph) is originally from Milwaukee, Crime novelist Billy Boyle (ph) from Brooklyn.\\n\\nDownstairs, Currence\\'s restaurant City Grocery cranks out many delicious things. The man known as big bad chef, a.k.a. Johnny Snack, is sending some of those goodies upstairs as there is nothing professional writers like more than free food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They usually put five writers in a room, it\\'s an ugly hell broth of envy, hatred...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We all hate Tommy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, that goes without saying.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even me, I hate me worst of all.\\n\\nPEDARVIS: Around here anyway, the writers are really supportive of each other.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\\n\\nPEDARVIS: For writers to argue would be like arguing over a piece of dirt.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nPEDARVIS: I mean, what are we fighting about? The stakes are so low. Why would you be a jerk about it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: If Mississippi were a country and there were a national hero, dead or alive, by consensus, statewide, who would -- who would the statue be of?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elvis.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really? Wouldn\\'t it B.B. King?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It should be -- it should be B.B. King. I mean, yes, but it would be Elvis.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (ph): But it would be Elvis.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I mean, Mississippi is, you know, the joke is that it\\'s not a state, it\\'s a club, that it\\'s so small that everybody knows everybody.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the middle of Mississippi, Oxford is an oasis of thought and -- and art and literature and feeling...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: ...and sentiment and everything. It\\'s the bonus (ph) place for velvet (ph) ditch (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Why the velvet (ph) ditch (ph)?\\n\\nPEDERVIS: I guess you just roll in and it\\'s pretty freaking comfortable. And you don\\'t care much about getting out, right, right? Am I right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Well, no one here seems too bitter about that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s a place that needs help but it\\'s a really great place. We\\'re never leaving.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is there a distinctive barbecue style in the state of Mississippi?\\n\\nCURRENCE: No, not that -- that we can really discern at all. And it\\'s part of the reason that we wanted to do this. We -- and we got our hands on this place and sort of been puzzled for years, you know, of what Mississippi barbecue is all about.\\n\\nThe more I dug into it, the less and less I can find. And so what we wanted to do is sort of take a look at barbecue that surrounds us and see if we could sort of Frankenstein barbecue.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: There isn\\'t really any fixed idea of Mississippi barbecue. And other than this place, Lamar Lounge, John Currence\\'s not-for- profit bar/restaurant, there\\'s no other pit-smoked whole hog barbecue in the entire state.\\n\\nA 175-pound pig will feed many mouths. About 250 people eat here a day.\\n\\nNow, this is a not-for-profit establishment?\\n\\nCURRENCE: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is that -- is that right?\\n\\nCURRENCE: Yes, it sure is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What kind of socialist, communist are you up to, Currence? What -- what -- what\\'s going on here? This is the state of Mississippi.\\n\\nCURRENCE: Just a feel-good kind of guy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Me, too.\\n\\nI\\'ve been here only a week and my sentences are starting to change already, because there\\'s not just a physical rhythm to the speech, but the way I\\'m organizing my thoughts is starting to change.\\n\\nSome of the Oxford writers from last night managed to make it out of bed, heads pounding no doubt, filled with the shame and self-loathing, surely familiar for writers. But like such greats of the past as Malcolm Lowery, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Charles Bukowski, they, too, have learned that more alcohol first thing will often make you feel better about the world, particularly if accompanied by freshly baked cornbread, biscuits, pulled pork off that whole hog, sweet jerk chicken and brisket.\\n\\nHell, I feel better already.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Mississippi that I perceived is not the Mississippi that I\\'ve had in my head. I was surprised how on sold I was off the bat. If you want to write, come to Oxford.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Do you think that\\'s true?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, apparently, yes.\\n\\nPERDARVIS: Like that line in Barton (ph), if you can\\'t throw a rock without hitting a writer, many says, do me a favor, throw it hard.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s easy to look at Mississippi and go, that just happens down there so we\\'re good. Our hands are clean.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s a totally misperceived place. When I came, I fell in love with the place. I never thought that I would. There\\'s something to it but you can\\'t put your finger on what it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What it is can be found in the dark spaces across the tracks and on the other side of town.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Rampage Lounge (ph) right by the cemetery and back by the river.\\n\\n21:52\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n21:56\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What is a juke joint? You\\'ve heard reference to them, no doubt, but -- but what is it? I guess the first thing you\\'ve got to know is it\\'s pronounced juke joint.\\n\\nAnd this one, this is a real good one. Scholars have suggested the work juk (ph) came from the Gullah, descendants of enslaved Africans. And it meant wicked or disorderly, to dance, or a place of shelter.\\n\\nJuke joints started in this (ph) plantation community rooms during slavery times. They went on to become the small, private African- American-run bars, clubs and lounges.\\n\\nFirst in rural areas, then in towns and cities, where workers could dance, drink, party and gamble as respite from the hard labor of Delta sharecropping, tenant farming, house service and segregation. They were often condemned by church leaders as houses of the devil.\\n\\nWilliam \"Po\\' Monkey\\'s\" Seaberry (ph) runs this place, as he has since 1963. And he makes the rules.\\n\\nHow long has this been in business?\\n\\nSEABERYY: Currently (ph) on (ph) its (ph) 50th (ph) year (ph). I\\'m 74.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How did you get into this business?\\n\\nSEABERRY: I just got into it, something I like to do. Then everybody come in and enjoy themselves, no problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Please explain this policy. No hats backwards and no pants hanging down...\\n\\nSEABERRY: That\\'s right. That\\'s right. If you don\\'t like my rules, don\\'t come.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What other rules here? No rap music.\\n\\nSEABERRY: No rap (ph) -- bump, bump, bump, I don\\'t like that (ph) stuff (ph). Give me a headache in this brain. I love all blues, all of (ph) the (ph) good, I mean, only blues.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good R&B?\\n\\nSEABERRY: That\\'s right, that\\'s right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: But no rap?\\n\\nSEABERRY: No, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Never? Even if I Kanye West wants to rent out the place, you\\'re going to rent it to him?\\n\\nSEABERRY: I\\'ll rent it to him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Just (ph) in (ph) case (ph).\\n\\nSEABERRY: So, I ain\\'t got time. And the world would be able to peek (ph) down (ph) all (ph) blues (ph). If you came (ph) for a good time, stay (ph) with me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Words to live by. Thank you, sir. I love your place and thank you for having us.\\n\\nSEABERRY: Well, you\\'ve got to come back again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, I surely will.\\n\\nSEABERRY: I\\'ll find somebody to get naked with you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, DJ, you can kick it back off.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thursday night is family night at Po\\' Monkey\\'s, mostly locals, a mixed bag. The music is classic R&B and pre-disco soul. The attitude, loose.\\n\\nJust familiarize yourself with those rules and there won\\'t be a problem. In the cities of the north where I come from, in some ways, we\\'ve been able to buy ourselves free from our past.\\n\\nNew arrivals pour in with no memory of the ugly parts of our history. We can afford the luxury of the new. We can live in comfortable bubbles, our apartments high in the sky.\\n\\nIn many ways, more separate than at anytime in history. But for Mississippi, the past is right there to see, still present, and coming to terms with it, not in abstract discussion, but the daily business of life.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  Mexico is a country where every day, people fight to live.  All too often, they lose that battle.\\n\\nA magnificent, heartbreakingly beautiful country.  The music and food, and a uniquely Mexican, darkly funny, deeply-felt world view.\\n\\nRight down there, cuddled up in ethos, our brother from another mother.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  \"Holy mother of Santa Muerte, please protect my stash of cocaine.  Let it not be interfered with by the cops, or the competition.  Let any who would mess with me be killed.  My enemies destroyed.  Please forgive us our sins, for they are many.\"\\n\\n(on camera):  So is business good?  I mean, is there more murders particularly narco murders?\\n\\nVALENTE ROJAS, PHOTOGRAPHER: (speaking in a foreign language)\\n\\nGRAPHIC:  They\\'re going up.  People decide to sell drugs because it\\'s the quickest way to make money.  So the increase in murders is related to this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Every day, Mexico wakes up to count the dead. They are, after all, left out to be seen.  Often with a helpful note, identifying who done what and, generally speaking, why.  There is a language to the never-ending violence, a coded message in the twists and marks of the bodies.\\n\\nAnd Valente Rojas is one of many documenting them for the press.  This is what he does every night, rides around waiting for a phone call or a radio message telling him that there\\'s another one.\\n\\n(on camera):  So who\\'s buying drugs?  Who\\'s selling drugs to who?\\n\\nROJAS:  (speaking in a foreign language)\\n\\nGRAPHIC:  Before, they brought a large number of drugs to sell in the U.S., but now domestic consumption is an important part of the drug trade.  The difference between the U.S. and here is it\\'s better here, because in the States, crazy people kill each other for no reason.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here, you kill each other for a reason.  It\\'s business?\\n\\nROJAS:  Si.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  More Mexican civilians have been killed since 2006 than all the American military lost in ten years of the Vietnam War and eight years of wars in Iraq.\\n\\n(on camera):  What do you do if you\\'re one of these cops?  You\\'re driving around one night.  You see some guy outside of a bar beating somebody or disturbing the peace.  You start to arrest him, and he\\'s got a diamond studded pistol.  It\\'s got his name on it.  Now you realize you\\'ve just arrested somebody with serious, powerful connections.  What do you do?\\n\\nROJAS:  (speaking a foreign language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You let him go?\\n\\nROJAS:  Si.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why do they always pull their pants down?  Our local fixer, Alex, is here to translate.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In this case, he thinks that they pull the pants down so -- checking for weapons.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They are loading them into the sheet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the CSI team.  So when they were pulling his pants off, money and jewelry started falling from the pockets. Basically, they took the money out of his pockets, and that was the only available spot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To show that they didn\\'t take anything.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, exactly.  So this was also a drug dealer. The thing here in Mexico is, as soon as someone\\'s killed, normally they get candles just right next to them.  Sometimes it\\'s related to drug dealings and criminals.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long have you been doing this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  About nine years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many bodies do you think?  Hundreds?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Si.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you push them out of your mind when you\\'re not working?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of people ask him about this.  But he said like it\\'s a job, not like any other kind of job, but as soon as he gets home, he just takes this cover off and just keep living.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a terrible picture.  It\\'s sad.  What happened here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was an elephant called Kilba (ph).  She run away from a circus so she basically was crossing the highway and was just run over.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The world we live in now, of all of these pictures, this is the one that would get people most upset.  You\\'d get the most mail, the most \"Oh, my God,\" you know, \"what kind of a world do we live in?\"\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was probably the most run picture from different media around the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Eighty thousand Mexicans have died in the last seven years in narco violence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And this is the most important picture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  As our crew gets ready to crawl back to our hotel, Valente gets the call we thought we\\'d been waiting for.  One dead male, shot in head.  A note pinned to his chest.\\n\\nIn Mexico, people fight to live every day.  One man stands alone, facing another man.  His intent, to beat his opponent with his fists until he can resist no more.  A match, yes, but more accurately, a fight.\\n\\nJorge La Tierra (ph) is a former bantamweight title holder.  With his father, Jorge Senior and his son Alexis, he trains aspiring fighters in this gym in the Santa Anita neighborhood of Mexico City.  He knows that these young men, like generations of boxers everywhere from other neighborhoods like this, are looking for a way out.\\n\\nJORGE LA TIERRA (PH), FORMER BANTAMWEIGHT TITLE HOLDER:  In Mexico, boxing is kind of -- save their life (ph), you know what I mean? Boxing give them, like, a little discipline.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Say you\\'re good, but you\\'re not that good.  Can you make a living just being a contender?\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  No, but a lot of fighters, they try to make it.  Tons of boxers.  They want to be a champion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody wants to be a champion.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  Everybody.  Everybody wants the big shot.  But you know, it\\'s just one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Those are bad odds.  The history of boxing is not kind.  I mean, most managers and owners don\\'t give a shit about the fighters.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  They don\\'t.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They use them up, but at the end they leave a guy all broken down, no money and scrambled brains.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  Just like prostitutes, you know what I mean?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In this area, what are your options, if you drop out of high school?\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  Nothing.  It\\'s just like being on the street, snatching, you know, robbing.  Like kids in the hood, they go, hey, kidnap that guy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Big industry.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  Everybody here now wants to be a soccer player.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why boxing?\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  Because they make money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who\\'s got a longer career, a narco or a boxer?\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  I don\\'t know.  Might be 50/50.  I mean, narco, you can last longer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can?\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  You\\'re protected by the police.  You just pay it off, nobody\\'s going to touch you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Expensive protein shakes and dietary supplements?  Not so much.  Boxers here eat what they can afford.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  The food is good and it\\'s cheap.  You know, in Mexico, there\\'s no middle class here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You\\'re either poor or you\\'re really, really rich.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  I mean, it\\'s a crazy thing.  The minimum wage here is like 50, 60 pesos, which is like five bucks.  Not an hour, a day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But on the other hand, that\\'s why Mexican fighters are so exciting.  They\\'re hungry.\\n\\nLA TIERRA (PH):  Exactly.  We\\'re hungry.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tepito is a city within its city.  Its own thing.  Either the dark center or the beating heart of Mexico City, depending on your point of view.\\n\\nIt\\'s the home of Santa Muerte, the skeletal St. Death.  This is where they come: the impoverished, the oppressed, the marginalized, the criminal.  People for whom the traditional church has less relevancy. For the unforgiven and the unforgiveable.  For those on whom the catholic saints have turned their backs, there is Santa Muerte.\\n\\nThis is a place and Santa Muerte is a saint that accepts everybody. \"Death to my enemies\" written on a votive candle.  Let\\'s face it, we\\'ve all prayed for that at one point or another.\\n\\nTepito is a poor neighborhood, for sure, and a tough one.  A center of commerce, both above-board and not.\\n\\nPerhaps a breakfast beverage first.  A michelada.  One giant beer with lemon, chili powder, salt and magi sauce.\\n\\n(on camera):  That\\'s a sizeable morning beverage.\\n\\n(voice-over):  My companion, blogger and chronicler of the city, Jorge Pedro.\\n\\n(on camera):  Wow.  A whole season of \"The Walking Dead\" for 25 cents.\\n\\n(voice-over):  You want to buy something, Tepito\\'s got it.  Looking for some cheap underwear, pirated copies of \"Man v. Food,\" seasons one through five?  This is where you find them.\\n\\n(on camera):  So this all seems very wholesome.  I mean, you know, where can I buy a gun, some heroin and a prostitute?  I was looking forward to that.\\n\\nJORGE PEDRO, BLOGGER:  Let\\'s say Tepito has many layers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPEDRO:  And we are in the surface.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nPEDRO:  We are among movies, clothing, families.  But I don\\'t think it\\'s as easy as to ask \"Where can I get a gun?\"  Probably, they will kill you if you ask that.\\n\\nYou know Santa Lopez.  Santa Lopez, patron saint of hopeless cases.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lost causes.\\n\\nPEDRO:  It\\'s become very popular in the last years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of good smells here, man.  A lot of good-looking food.\\n\\n(voice-over):  My happy place is somewhere in here.  Oh, there it is.\\n\\nPEDRO:  Yes.  We are here amigas (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Beautiful.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Wherever there\\'s bones and guts simmering in broth, chances are I\\'ll be happy.\\n\\nWriter, sociologist and life-long resident of Tepito, Alfonso (ph) Hernandez, apparently feels the same way.\\n\\n(on camera):  So is this supposed to be a bad neighborhood?  This is the best.  I love this neighborhood.\\n\\nALFONSO (PH) HERNANDEZ, WRITER:  (speaking foreign language)\\n\\nPEDRO:  It is known as being the lost souls neighborhood.  It is called angeles (ph) neighborhood, like angels.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPEDRO:  In Tepito, there are no angels but lost souls.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s the saying?\\n\\nALFONSO (PH) HERNANDEZ:  (speaking foreign language)\\n\\nPEDRO:  Showing your -- los huevos (ph) to the death.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Show your balls to the devil or to...\\n\\nPEDRO:  To the death.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  On the menu, migas.  The base comes from boiling cracked hambones to release the marrow, to which garlic, onion, cascabel (ph) peppers and episote is added.  Thickened with stale bread and leftover tortillas.\\n\\n(on camera):  You got nothing, you make something really awesome out of nothing.\\n\\nPEDRO:  The grandmothers had the creativity to take advantage of the bones of the pigs, and now it\\'s a good dish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any great old culture where there\\'s poverty, there\\'s something like this.  By the way, if you\\'re watching this after you do this, you\\'ve really got to wash your hands before you touch your -- OK?  That\\'s a rookie mistake.  Don\\'t go piss right after.\\n\\nPEDRO:  She\\'s asking you if you like the migas.  Did you enjoy it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, it\\'s good.  Delicious.  So this has been open 65 years?\\n\\nPEDRO:  All the members of the crew are relatives.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there hope for social change in this country?\\n\\nALFONSO (PH) HERNANDEZ:  (speaking foreign language)\\n\\nPEDRO:  Unfortunately, Mexico has become the Tepito of the world. Tepito, this is still the synthesis (ph) of the Mexican.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Not a lot of upward mobility here.  The rich get richer; the poor get ground slowly under the wheel.  Eduardo Garcia has hacked his way up the ladder to become chef owner of the city\\'s hottest restaurant.\\n\\nEDUARDO GARCIA, CHEF OWNER, RESTAURANT:  I grew up in the states.  I was a migrant worker picking fruits and vegetables as a kid.  My parents didn\\'t earn a lot of money, so I decided to work rather than go to school.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The restaurant business, as I well know, ain\\'t no picnic. And in Mexico City, it\\'s particularly rough.\\n\\nGARCIA:  Mexico has a reputation where we all know that the country\\'s run by corrupt politics.  You have to stand up for what you believe. If you don\\'t, people will run you over.  You won\\'t last a minute.  I don\\'t let people bully me around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Garcia runs Maximo Bistro with his wife, Gabriella.  Here\\'s the kind of extra helping of crap you\\'ve got to deal with if you run the hottest restaurant in Mexico City.\\n\\nIn 2013, the spoiled daughter of the head of Mexico\\'s consumer protection agency walks in and demands a table when there\\'s, unsurprisingly, no table available.  When Garcia says, \"Sorry, no can do,\" she pulls a \"You know who I am?\" and then calls daddy and gets the health inspectors in to shut the place down.\\n\\n(on camera):  So your other customers basically started taking pictures of them with their cell phones?\\n\\nGARCIA:  Next thing you know, we have the media outside and this is Friday.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGARCIA:  Sunday morning, we\\'re front page of one of the most important newspapers in Mexico.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, it was very embarrassing to the government.\\n\\nGARCIA:  And it should be.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Because they got caught doing what they do all the time, but if you were not the hottest restaurant in town, you were just running a cantina, you know, a few blocks away...\\n\\nGARCIA:  I would have been...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They would have closed you down and that\\'s that.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Right now, a defiant young creative generation of chefs like Eduardo are performing some of the most exciting new cooking anywhere on earth, a mixing of the very old and traditional with the very new.\\n\\n(on camera):  So you went to Le Bernardin.\\n\\nGARCIA:  As a kid, yes.  One of the jokes throughout the whole time that I worked is \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m 18.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve been 18 for three years.\"\\n\\nThose are abalone from Baca (ph).  I told you I love butter.  I use it even for some Mexican dishes.  And then just roasted chilis serrano, just to give it a nice little kick for me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  They/re finished with lemon and, of course, brown butter.\\n\\n(on camera):  Beautiful.  Mm.  Very delicious.  Very Mexican, very French.  Brown butter, awesome.  Makes everything better.\\n\\nGARCIA:  Of course.  I think the most important thing about Mexican cuisine, in general, if it\\'s traditional, it\\'s the ingredients.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Confit is suckling pig topped with grandma\\'s salsa.  An instant classic.\\n\\nGARCIA:  Have at it.  You do it like the Mexican way.  Pick it up and go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Wow.  Pretty hard to imagine anything better than that.  You\\'re stuck with this dish forever, man.\\n\\nGARCIA:  Forever.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s going to be like Mick Jagger, you know, 50 years from now singing \"Satisfaction.\"  There\\'s no getting away from it, man. This is so good.  This is a classic.\\n\\n(voice-over):  But even now with all his success, Garcia is still fighting a struggle most Mexicans are all too familiar with.\\n\\nGARCIA:  What happened that day happens every day.  And the promise always is we\\'re going to shut you down.  you don\\'t know who I am.  And for me, I\\'d rather close my restaurant than live like that.  If you close my restaurant, I will go across the street.  I will go to another state or I will go to another country, and I still will make a good restaurant.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Under former President Felipe Calderon, Mexico launched a concerted war on drugs.  Ostensibly against the notorious and seemingly untouchable cartels.  Absolutely no one can say with any credibility, by the way, that Mexico\\'s war or our trillion-dollar war...\\n\\nRONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Just say no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... has had any effect in diminishing the flow of drugs into our country.  One very brave journalist has uncovered exactly how deep the rot of corruption and dirty money has penetrated into every level of Mexican institutions.\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ, JOURNALIST:  My grandmother is from Oaxaca, so how we used to drink the mescal is never with lemon.  It\\'s with orange.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is not what a lot of people wanted to hear, much less see published.  Today, Anabel Hernandez, author of the ground-breaking expose, \"Los Senores Del Narco,\" lives under guard in a secret location.  The threat, very, very real and very explicit.\\n\\n(on camera):  Do you think there was ever a minute when the Calderon war on drugs, was it ever genuine?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  No.  Who really start the war against the drug cartels was Vicente Fox.  Felipe Calderon just followed that instruction, but he didn\\'t really do anything new.  He just did it worse.  Since the beginning, the plan of the government was protect the Sinaloa cartel and fight against the enemies of the Sinaloa cartel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Of the seven major Mexican cartels, the Sinaloa cartel is considered the most powerful, with the farthest- reaching and most pervasive tentacles extending deep into every corner of government, banking and private industry.\\n\\nIts rivals, the Tijuana cartel, the Gulf cartel, the Juarez cartel, the Beltran-Leyva, La Familia Michoacana, and the particularly murderous Los Zetas.  The cartels are responsible for importing roughly three quarters of all illegal narcotics to America.\\n\\n(on camera):  In your work, you\\'ve uncovered what had to be some very embarrassing and incriminating associations and connections between very high elected officials, the presidents and entire administrations, and acts of incredible criminality.  How did that change your life?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  Well, when I started to make this investigation in 2005, I really understand that it would be very dangerous.  I have to say that it wasn\\'t really a surprise for me what happened after I published my book.  What I didn\\'t expect is that the threats came from the federal government.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Anabel says that one of her sources warned her that the biggest threat was from within, that one of the most highly placed, most senior law enforcement officials in Mexico had ordered her killed.\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  Because in my book, I put his name and also showed some documents that proves that he was involved, he was on the payroll of the Sinaloa cartel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happened to this man?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  Right now, he\\'s very happy drinking rum, I think, building many enterprises, fake enterprises, laundry his money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To me, the weak link are the bankers.  A banker who launders money, he\\'s got a family, he\\'s got a reputation, he gives money to charity, his neighbors think he\\'s great, his kids think he\\'s wonderful, but he\\'s got something to lose.  So I wouldn\\'t be prosecuting drug dealers.  I would be prosecuting bankers.\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  The name of my book is \"Los Senors del Narco,\" because los senors del narco are not only a chapugas (ph) man and the leaders of these cartels -- no.  Los senors del narco are also this, the politicians and bankers and the businessmen.  The people have to know who are these people name by name.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And you have been a journalist for how long?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  20.  20 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  20 years.  Your father was killed, kidnapped and killed in 2000?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  My father was a businessman.  In that year, many gangs used to kidnap businessmen just for money.  So when we went to the police and asked them to investigate, they said, well, if you pay us, we will make the investigation.  So, as family, we decide to pay because you cannot buy the justice.\\n\\nSince that, I really tried to fight against corruption.  That\\'s why I\\'m doing what I do, because I think that corruption is the worst problem in Mexico.  The drug cartels are maybe the worst face of that problem, but the problem in the deep is the corruption.  The corruption is the mother of all our problems in Mexico.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It should be pointed out that 88 journalists, how many journalists have been killed in this country?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ: 90 now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: 90 journalists have now been killed or disappeared over the last few years.\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can kill a journalist and get away with it.  Why are you still here?\\n\\nANABEL HERNANDEZ:  I have lost many things in my life.  My father was the most important person in my life.  I already lost everything.  I don\\'t have any life anymore.  I don\\'t have a social life.  I don\\'t have a sentimental life.  I don\\'t have anything.  I just have my work and my family.\\n\\nAnd my work of a journalist is everything for me.  I really believe that good journalists can change the world.  I have received many offers to go outside to France, to Sweden and other countries.  I don\\'t want to leave.  It\\'s my choice.  My choice is fight.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I came to Oaxaca for mescal.  I like mescal more and more these days.  And this guy, Ron Cooper, finds and sells some of the best mescal in the world.\\n\\nWe\\'re at the Zapotec ruins of Monte Alban.\\n\\nRON COOPER:  In pre-conquest Mexico, there were gods and goddesses of intoxication and ecstasy.  The touch of a lover, the smell of a flower, the a-ha of an idea, all had gods and goddesses that took responsibility for those things.  BOURDAIN (on camera):  All of your mescals come from different villages and only that village?\\n\\nCOOPER:  Yes.  And only one maker in that village.  We call ourself single village mescal because most mescals are made with a blend of different villages all put together.  No one goes home and has a cocktail in these Indian villages.  They wait until there\\'s a special occasion.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nCOOPER:  Every birth, death, confirmation, baptism, there\\'s a fiesta. A wedding is eight days.  You invite 200 people.  You feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You have a band every day.  And then they really consume.\\n\\nDon\\'t drink yet.  For Mother Earth and her ancestors.  And then you say (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s extraordinary.  Back in the day, it was cheap stuff with a worm in it and there were rumors that if you ate the worm, you would start tripping, there was a hallucinogenic component to mescal. Is there a particular kind of high?  Is this an enlightening high?  is this a good high?\\n\\nCOOPER:  The high is humorous.  There are funny thoughts dancing around the back of your head.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Happy, witty drunk.\\n\\nCOOPER:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In Oaxaca, ancient, indigenous traditions of ingredients define not only the mescal but also the food.\\n\\nALEJANDRO RUIZ OLMEDO, CHEF:  One of the main reasons people visit our city is to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Alejandro Ruiz Olmedo, one of Mexico\\'s best chefs. He started cooking young.  When he was 12, his mother died and it fell on him to raise and feed his five siblings.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  This is what we call pasajo (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Today he draws much of his inspiration from Oaxaca\\'s central market.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Probably America\\'s most beloved food is what they think is Mexican food.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And I think most Americans\\' view of Mexican food is like beans, fried tortilla, melted cheese, some chicken.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  Yes.  BOURDAIN:  In fact, in particular when we\\'re talking about Oaxaca, this is a deep, really sophisticated cuisine.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  That\\'s correct.  Oaxaca has these different microclimates all over our territory and that gives us this enormous amount of spices, produce, fruits, chilis.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like 500,000 varieties of corn.  Something like that.  I mean, this is where the good shit grows.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  This is fancy (ph) barbacoa, and this lady here is always making the best.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tender.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  Yes.  Tender, tasty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Some crunch.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  Cabbage and cilantro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, unbelievably good.  So tasty.  Mm.  Man, deep.  It\\'s good.  I\\'ll finish this.  This is just too damn good.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  People have this barbecue especially on Sundays.  It\\'s a tradition to have barbacoa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So tasty.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  All this is full of chilis.  People think that Mexican food has to be necessarily spicy because of all the chili we use.  And we go for flavor, not for the spices.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What most people miss is how really deep and really sophisticated the sauces here can be.  Like Lyon is to France, Oaxaca is to Mexico, in my experience.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  You\\'re right.  Also in my experience.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not kissing your ass here.  I was just in Lyon.\\n\\n(voice-over):  This is Vicky\\'s place.  She has been cooking up traditional Oaxacan dishes in the market for 30 years.\\n\\n(on camera):  Whoa, that\\'s awesome.  He\\'s cooking egg right on the kamal.  Oh, man.  So the guy working the kamal, first of all, a lot of the kamal you see now are metal.  That\\'s old school, super old school. That\\'s the way they did back in Zapotec times, on the clay kamal.  I\\'m looking there, he\\'s doing tortillas and doing one of my favorite things, the zucchini flour with string cheese.  So pretty to see.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Olmedo\\'s cooking, his focus, his passion have very old, very deep roots.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  My parents were farmers in a small village.  Since you are 6, 7, 8, you have a role to develop in the family. BOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  So my role was to water the chili plantation, the tomato plantation, to milk the cows and help my mom when she was making tortillas like that.  She would give me directions and tell me, OK roll the chilis, roll the tomatoes, I will tell you how to prepare molcajete salsa.  So that was the beginning of my profession, learning from the knowledge of how a tomato should taste like when you cut it directly from the plant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The way it should taste.  Old school\\n\\nOLMEDO:  That\\'s right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.  Happy.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  This is what I should do.  Try the egg (ph) first, like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just grab a hunk.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  Yes.  And then put salsa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  I haven\\'t been anywhere in Mexico where the cooking is better than here.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  This is the way to preserve our culture, through our food.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The quiet little town of Teotitlan del Valle is about 15 miles outside of Oaxaca, a town where the arts, crafts and traditions of pre-Hispanic Mexico are celebrated and packaged for consumption.\\n\\nAbigail Mendoza and her sister Rufina are Zapotecan, original people from Mexico before the Spanish, before the Aztecs.  This is her restaurant, where Abigail has been grinding corn by hand, making masa and moles like this, the ridiculously faithful, time-consuming, difficult, traditional way she was taught to make these things, and the way she\\'s been making them since she was 6 years old.\\n\\nLook at her hands, by the way.  Small, surprisingly delicate, given all the hard work, all the pushing, kneading, grinding stone against stone over the years.  Then look at her forearms.  The power there. It\\'s impressive and beautiful.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  Every time you enter the house, in Oaxaca, especially in the small villages, they always offer you a shot of mescal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Mm, so good.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Seguesa (ph), a mole and chicken dish.  This mole sauce, like a lot of the real old school moles made by masters like Abigail, use 35 different types of chili peppers and takes more than two weeks to make.  (on camera):  Do you think that until recently, until guys like you, that Mexicans were not looking back at their own food culture, they were looking elsewhere?  What was going on?\\n\\nOLMEDO:  We were conquerers.  We are were also a culture that was conquered first by the Aztecs and then we conquered by the Spaniards, so we were always taught everything that was good and excellent has to be imported.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  What we have here, it was just not good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Right.  Another Zapotecan classic, chili agua, a simpler dish of cow and pork brains cooked with chilis, tomatoes and yerba santa.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  As a cook, the main thing I needed to learn was to develop a little bit my cuisine here.  There was this space where nobody tried to innovate.  Still using the same techniques, the same ingredient, the same flavors, herbs, et cetera, but developing them a little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I mean, that\\'s as old-school as it gets.  This is super ancient.\\n\\nOLMEDO:  A final dish, and this one that cannot have.  This is something that you do not find anywhere else in Mexico.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The quiet night in the zocalo, the central square of Oaxaca.  But even tonight there\\'s plenty of evidence of the struggle, the discontent, boiling just under the surface.  The graffiti and painting of this street artist who goes by the name Yesca captures that spirit of Oaxacan protest.\\n\\n(on camera):  \"The Last Supper,\" for sure.\\n\\nYESCA, STREET ARTIST:  It\\'s \"The Last Supper\" but Mexican last supper.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who are these people?\\n\\nYESCA:  These are most powerful people in Mexico.  People that is driving Mexico.  This is Pena Nieto, the president right now.  This is Felipe Calderon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYESCA:  The last president.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The last president.\\n\\nYESCA:  That guy is like the economy guy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  YESCA:  Who\\'s moving the economy in Mexico.  And this is the army. This is a prostitute.  This represent because they are like prostitutes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYESCA:  You know?  And narco traffic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh.\\n\\nYESCA:  He is like the god in Mexico.  You know?  Because he is, like, over --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All of it.\\n\\nYESCA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this is the way Mexico works?\\n\\nYESCA:  Yes.  For me, the most problem in Mexico is the corruption.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mexico can be a dangerous place for journalists, for politicians, for police.  Is it a dangerous place for artists?\\n\\nYESCA:  Yes.  I think so, yes, because if you do not agree with the government, you are like enemy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 1936, the town of Cuernavaca, 50 miles from Mexico City, was visited by Malcolm Lowry, the tormented self-loathing, brilliant and hopelessly alcoholic author.  His life work, \"Under the Volcano,\" was set here.  It is widely believed to be one of the great novels of the 20th Century.  Lowry saw symbolism and evil everywhere here.  In the deep areas, the looming volcano that towered overhead.\\n\\nWriter-poet, Javier Sicilia, one of Cuernavaca\\'s most celebrated residents, has reason to see evil, too.  On March 28th, 2011, narcos kidnapped and murdered his son, Juan Francisco, and six other equally blameless victims. Sicilia found himself moved to march to Mexico City to demand an end to the increasingly futile so-called war on drugs that was mindlessly grinding up so many victims in the crossfire and in the margins.\\n\\n(on camera):  In \"Under the Volcano,\" the evil that\\'s coming is fascism, Nazism.  What is the heart of the infernal machine today?\\n\\nJAVIER SICILIA, WRITER & POET:  (SPEAKING IN SPANISH).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What does he want to say?  What does he want people to hear?\\n\\nSICILIA:  We need to stop this war.  It\\'s a war where we are killing our sons and daughters.  We are losing the democracy of this divided and broken country.  We need to find the peace and the justice that this country does not have.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Can he think of one place on earth where the good guys are winning? Where you are not ground under the wheels of the machine?\\n\\nSICILIA:  When people participate in good and loving relationships, there it is.  Peace.  Where there are (inaudible) that refuse to accept death, who refuse to accept that they keep killing, that they keep throwing bodies into the street beheaded, when there is a society that can say, \"This is where the human being is above anything else.\" There is life.  There is a good place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you written a poem since the death of your son?\\n\\nSICILIA:  No.  I wrote my last poem when (INAUDIBLE) assassination of Juan Francisco, my son.  And with that, I (INAUDIBLE) write poems.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As I have come to know in my own life, drugs, even drug addiction, can be a survivable event.  Death is not.  Death is final.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n[19:00:17]  ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  And vacation over, as we headed home to our regular beds, our daily lives of school and homework and ordinary things.  Maybe my little brother, maybe I would wake up and look out the window at the night sky and suddenly it would fill with stars and golden mist, and we\\'d pretend for a second we were somehow deep inside the Milky May, a million winking lights, but we knew where we really were.  We were almost home.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, enchanted land of my childhood, a cultural Petri dish from which regularly issues forth greatness.\\n\\nNew Jersey, in case you didn\\'t know it, has got beaches, beautiful beaches, and they\\'re not all crawling with raging trolls with reality shows.  I grew up summering on those beaches and they\\'re awesome. Jersey\\'s got farmland, beautiful bedroom communities where that woman from \"Real Housewives\" who looks like Dr. Zayas (ph) does not live, nor anyone like her.  Even the refineries, the endless clover leaves of turnpikes and expressways twisting in unknowable patterns over the wetlands are to me somehow beautiful.  To know Jersey is to love her.\\n\\nFt. Lee, you may have heard of it.  Some of Governor Christie\\'s minions allegedly conspired to jam up traffic for a few days.  It\\'s a town with a jokey history of corruption.  It\\'s also where my beloved Hiram\\'s is, opened since 1932 and pretty much unchanged ever since. My dad started bringing me and my younger brother, Chris, here in the 50s and they still honor tradition.\\n\\n(on camera):  Sometimes I just the need that old-time flavor again. It seems like a chew food.  Basically, my dad would take me here.  It is a great point of pride and personal satisfaction and I\\'ve convinced my daughter that this is the finest hot dogs in the land.  She gets very excited to come out here, which makes me very happy.\\n\\nThank you.  Thank you.  This is heat.  The toothpicks are just like 1958.  Some things just shouldn\\'t change.\\n\\nMy dad used to love pickle lily, a relish.  And I loved this stuff. Look at that beauty.\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\nI come here to feed my soul, the cultural wellspring that\\'s New Jersey.  It\\'s the antidote to every other place.\\n\\nThe place is perfect.  The dogs are amazing.\\n\\nAnd there are not a lot of people in this world courageous enough to not change.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Down the shore.  Yeah, we actually talk like that.  It was what we did, go down the shore.  Not just our family, from Bergen County near the bridge, but middle class families and working-class families from Philly and all over who packed up the kids in the station wagon for the seemingly interminable trip to Long Beach Island.\\n\\n(on camera):  Just getting out the driveway was bad.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN, BROTHER OF ANTHONY BOURDAIN:  It always took three extra hours with a loaded-down car.\\n\\n[19:05:05]  BOURDAIN:  There was always drama.  Strapping crap to the roof of the car.\\n\\n(voice-over):  But once we were over the bridge, the excitement would ratchet up.  Ship Bottom, then Surf City, Harvey Cedars (ph), Loveladies (Ph).  Ticking off the town names until finally, finally, Barnegat Light.\\n\\n(on camera):  These are all new.  Wait, but that\\'s original.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yeah, definitely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think I know who lived there at one point.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  That\\'s definitely old school.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s face it.  It\\'s been how many years?  40 --\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  400, I think.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jesus, we\\'re old.  The lighthouse.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Definitely remember going to that lighthouse a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, the good old days.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI want some fried clam strips.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our options are limited, shall we say, but -- holy crap, this place is filling up.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I think it\\'s because it\\'s the only place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still, who lives out here year round?\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  We\\'re about to see every single one of them.  BOURDAIN:  Let\\'s be honest.  When we came here in the summer summers,\\n\\nI was the bad one.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yes, yes.  Your recollection is correct.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was up to every variety of anti-social behavior down here.  I didn\\'t smoke dope for the first time here.  I was looking for dope, but as a 12-year-old it was hard to come by.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I remember you vaguely you walking off with some sort of cute girl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First kiss.  That was an important passage.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  It is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I realize now I hitchhiked regularly.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:   Mom, dad, I\\'m going to go to Ship Bottom tonight with some friends.  How are you getting there?  Hitchhiking.  OK.  Have fun.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  All the kids hitchhiked.  That\\'s how you got places here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Summertime.  You know that sound?  Just out of the water, ears pressed up against the beach blanket, the squeak of bare feet on sand nearby, Classics illustrated comics waited for me back at the house.  I\\'d play with my little plastic army men in the dunes.  And there\\'s a smell of beach grass in the dunes.  You remember it?\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I still crave it.  I love it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And on special occasions, clams and drawn butter.  No matter where I find them now, they always bring me back here.\\n\\n(on camera):  I remember this place with nothing but fondness.  I can\\'t remember a single bad memory here.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  It was great.\\n\\nPeople you knew from last year were here.  A lot of them in the street.  The parents didn\\'t need to be with you.  Have a camp fire on the beach at night.  Firecrackers, all this stuff they wouldn\\'t let you do at home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The beach would look different.  For a couple of days, the whole beach would be this weird foamy surf, like frothy bubbling.  Now we\\'re talking.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Or there would be the jelly fish sometimes where there would be --  BOURDAIN:  Infestation of jelly fish, right.  I try to block that out.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  That wonderful feeling that you were with other 10 year old along the bank, along the beach.  It was great.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I love clam strips.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  These are great.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These are awesome.  So far, so great.  I\\'m happy.  Battered piece of fish with some good tartar sauce.\\n\\nWhat were your favorite activities?\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Building a campfire on the beach.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Overturning the lifeguard stand.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yes.  Firecrackers on the beach.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Firecrackers on the beach.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:   I have some firecrackers in your car, by the way. Just saying.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Set them off in the elevator at the casino.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Perfect.  Perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\n(voice-over):  It was paradise.  America\\'s first dream vacation.  The beach, as far as America was concerned, meaning bathing suits and swimming in the surf was pretty much invented here.  Atlantic City, rich or working class, it was here for you.  Back then, you dressed up to walk the Boardwalk.  It was capitalism at its purist and most assertive.  It was a democratic dream designed from the beginning for everybody.  Flashy, utilitarian, upright, deeply, unapologetically corrupt.\\n\\nThe Knife and Fork Inn was right there through it all.  In many ways, its story a perfect reflection of changing times.  Established in 1912, it was a so-called gentleman\\'s dining and drinking club.  The second floor had curtained alcoves and a separate lady\\'s lounge, private rooms on the third and fourth floor were set aside for games of chance and perhaps other activities.\\n\\nVicki Gold Levi\\'s dad was the chief photographer for Atlantic City from the 1930s to the 1960s.  He saw it all and, by extension, so did Vicki.\\n\\n[19:10:13]  (on camera):  What was it like here as a kid?\\n\\nVICKI GOLD LEVI, ATLANTIC CITY HISTORIAN:  It was fantastic.  Walking down the Boardwalk in the summertime was like walking in a carnival at midway, the cacophony of noises.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There was still remnants of the \\'20s.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  That sensibility, that look, handle bar mustaches, Victorian graphic design and illustration, the weird stuck- in-time feel was still very much in evidence, even in my time here in the early 60s.  The Boardwalk was over six miles of amusements, entertainments, parades, and pageants, a never-ending carnival.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  Every place you went down the Boardwalk was something else to see and all the stores were mom-and-pop stores, all very unique.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  And I loved it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The world-famous steel pier, amusement arcades, novelties, salt water taffy.\\n\\n(on camera):  I loved the joke shops.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  The joke shops.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was a wonderland of juvenile delinquency.  Everybody was buying plastic dog crap and --\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- vomit and smoke powder.  It was just something very sinister and forbidden.  And my parents indulged me when I was here.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The menu has changed somewhat since the original.  For me, a very tasty pretzel-crusted swordfish over lump crab meat.  For Vicki, pan-seared scallops.\\n\\n(on camera):  My memories of Atlantic City are largely built around the time before gambling.  Times were not good.  I mean, the Marlboro (inaudible), I remember it well, was largely empty, but it was a magnificent structure.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  You and I like the nostalgia.  The people who like Coney Island like it, but I don\\'t know about the young people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful buildings are beautiful buildings.  A beautiful view is a beautiful view forever.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s no other place with this kind of history and legitimacy.  This place has deep romantic allure.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  I agree with you.  I believe in the transition that\\'s coming.  I really, really do, with all my heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hundreds of businesses used to be here.  It\\'s not a matter of, gee, that would be great if that happened again.  It is inevitable that it will happen again.  It\\'s worth fixing.  Atlantic City can be chic easily because the bones, the skeleton of the city are beautiful.\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  I\\'m glad you feel that way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is even, in young people, particularly now, beautiful old things.  A beautiful old restaurant with really great food --\\n\\nGOLD LEVI:  That we\\'re in right now?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- is much more interesting than a glass box with good food.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[19:15:59]  BOURDAIN:  The names of Atlantic City streets were imprinted on generations of Americans who grew up playing Monopoly. Drive down Ventnor Avenue today and you see history.  Te ebb and flow of America\\'s hopes and dreams played out in the buildings and homes you see as you pass by.  Magnificent mansions mixed in with inexpensive two-family houses, cheap takeout, the footprints of a lost world.  The Riviera of the northeast still there if you look between. With jet travel in Miami and an expanded highway system, things declined, as they do.  But a few visionary geniuses presented a solution, a cure that would overnight make everybody well, make Atlantic City shiny and new and prosperous again.  Men like Donald Trump.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, CEO, TRUMP GROUP:  I think it\\'s going to be really very beneficial to everybody.  We look forward to operating the Taj Mahal successfully for many years to come.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Vast new Xanadus would be construction.  And would-be Kubla Khan\\'s rushed to Atlantic City eager to tap into what was assured to be a never-ending gusher of prosperity, casino gambling.\\n\\n(on camera):  When casino gambling was sold to the state of New Jersey and to Atlantic City as the cure-all, it was going to bring it back to its glory days, did it change anything?\\n\\nBRIAN DONOHUE, NEW JERSEY REPORTER:  When you drove around today, do you think this place is better than it was?  Do you think it helped?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, I don\\'t.\\n\\n(voice-over):  New Jersey native, Brian Donohue, is a reporter with 20 years experience focusing on south Jersey.\\n\\nDock\\'s Oyster House, an establishment that survived Prohibition, the Great Depression, two world wars, numerous declines, and rebirths. Still here, still great, a symbol of what Atlantic City was, and should be again, could be again.\\n\\nDONOHUE:  Bringing Atlantic City back after its decline is a very complicated and hard process.  There was no easy answer.  Casino gambling was seen as an easy answer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.  It sure sounded like a good idea.\\n\\nDONOHUE:  They were going to bring 12 casinos here and bring everybody up from the top, down.  It hasn\\'t worked.  Then you\\'re left with just 12 casinos-\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If you\\'re looking for an example of a lemming- like lurch towards a shinny new cliff face from which to tumble, look no further than this $2.4 billion goat rodeo, the Revel.  It opened in 2012 and closed less than two years later.  The most expensive casino in New Jersey history.\\n\\nDONOHUE:  It was incredible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What were they thinking?\\n\\nDONOHUE:  Short-term, money, and at a time when all these other casinos were opening all over the entire east coast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was nuts.  It\\'s economics 101.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Casinos, by design, neglect the city\\'s existing assets, salt air, a walk by the glorious North Atlantic, the greatest of all the earth\\'s bodies of water, the classic attractions, the restaurants.\\n\\nDONOHUE:  This is what it is going to take for Atlantic City to come back.  But it\\'s going to be places like this.  Celebrate the ghosts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Some nice crab cake, at Dock\\'s, a big freaking lobster stuffed with crab imperial, plum souffle.  Those things are bad for business, the business of taking your money.\\n\\n(on camera):  Thank you so much.  Lovely.  That\\'ll work.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to sound like I\\'m down on Atlantic City, because I see it as an incredibly almost ludicrously hopeful place.  Whatever is left of it should be hung onto because it is going to come around\\n\\n(on camera):  There\\'s nothing funny about losing all your money, yet casinos are steady employers of that most hard-working species entertainer.  Comedians Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane are two of the hardest-working people around.  Married to each other and New Jersey.\\n\\n[19:20:03]  RICH VOS, COMEDIAN:  It\\'s so much money to live here.  I drove three exits on the Jersey Turnpike, it was $7.  If you drive a whole new Jersey Turnpike, when you get to the end, you have to give them your car.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBONNIE MCFARLANE, COMEDIAN:  I\\'m going to tell you something that I don\\'t tell people right away.  I\\'m very passionate about it.  No animal byproducts of any kind.  I\\'m vegan.  I do cheat a little.  I eat veal.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIt\\'s so tender.  How do they get it like that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I\\'m very sentimental about Jersey Italian, particularly spaghetti and meatballs.  That\\'s what I was going to go for.\\n\\nVOS:  I\\'ve eaten here at least five to ten times and I\\'ve never had a bad meal, ever.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nVOS:  I wouldn\\'t get the meatballs.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Proud long-time residents of New Jersey?\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  No.  I\\'ve lived here for nine years, but only been proud maybe the last two.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real long time this sort of --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Picking up the speed?\\n\\nMCFARLANE:   Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Born and bred?\\n\\nVOS:  Yes, my whole life.\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  He won\\'t leave.  I had to make peace with him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When was the first time you played Atlantic City?\\n\\nVOS:  There was a club at the Sands.  Many times I would get paid on Thursday and then I would lose it all and then I\\'d have to work for free.  There\\'s no worse feeling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, I know that feeling.\\n\\nVOS:  Have you ever watched a couple in Atlantic City?  Hold this money.  Don\\'t give it back to me no matter what I tell you.  I don\\'t care what I say.  An hour later, give me my god damn money.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNo, I\\'m not fooling around.  You better give me my money.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nYou\\'re the reason I\\'m losing, touching my arm when I\\'m shooting craps.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there a specifically Jersey sense of humor that you\\'ve noticed?\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  Yes, I love Jersey audiences now so much.  I have never one time ever said anything where people in the audience have said, ah.  They never get offended.\\n\\nWe all have our words that we don\\'t like, the one\\'s that affect us the most.  I have my trigger words.  As a white woman, the word I don\\'t like is no.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI don\\'t hear it that often, but when I do, huh-uh.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nVOS:  Here\\'s the deal with Jersey.  People land up north and they drive up the turnpike.  They don\\'t turn off and go up and --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They see refineries.\\n\\nVOS:  That\\'s New Jersey.  How sick is that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think it\\'s beautiful?\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  More horses per capita than any other state.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  New Jersey is the embroidery capital of the world.\\n\\nVOS:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Apparently.  I don\\'t know where that\\'s happening.\\n\\nVOS:  I used to work for an embroidery company.\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  No.\\n\\nVOS:  I swear to god.\\n\\nI\\'ll call her right now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a taste of my youth.\\n\\nFor all of the things about New Jersey, will people ever come across the bridge and the tunnel in the other direction?\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  No.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nVOS:  No?  OK.\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  I did not have to think about that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s go out to a club in Jersey.\\n\\nVOS:  No.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nVOS:  It\\'s all relative.  A 25-year-old guy or girl is going, we\\'re not going to Jersey.  A 60-year-old person is going, I\\'m getting the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) out of this city.\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  There\\'s your answer.  Never going to be you.\\n\\nVOS:  Where does hipness stop?  At what age?\\n\\nMCFARLANE:  Hipness is overrated.\\n\\nVOS:  Yeah, it is overrated.  I love living here.  I love it.\\n\\nPine Valley, the best golf course in the country.  Trump has beautiful courses.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Trump, I\\'m not a fan.\\n\\nVOS:  Who is?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every minute that he walks, it demands a certain complicity to not shout out, look at that ridiculous looking --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- head.  It\\'s like if you have a disfigurement.  That tacit agreement I\\'m not going to bring it up.  That\\'s too much to ask of me in Trump\\'s case.  I want to scream.\\n\\nVOS:  Do you know why he puts his names on the building?  So the banks know which ones to take back.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAt least he\\'s a humble guy.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nVOS:  Jesus.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[19:27:40]  BOURDAIN:  There are few American cities, places where things have gone as disastrously wrong as Camden, New Jersey.  It\\'s like the poster child for everything a city can screw up.  Once a manufacturing power house, home to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, The Campbell Soup Company, and RCA Victor Records, a company town.  About 80,000 people live here today.  That\\'s the same number of people who were employed in its heyday.  Nearly 40 percent of the city\\'s high school students don\\'t graduate.  The entire police force replaced by the state.  More than one-third of city residents live below the poverty line.  Voter turnout, not good.  If there\\'s any place one can be forgiven for just throwing your hands up in the air and giving up, it\\'s here.  But no.  Cities with serious problems need extraordinary people.  And Tawanda Jones is clearly an extraordinary person.\\n\\nTAWANDA JONES, NEW JERSEY RESIDENT:  When you give, especially to someone who is really in need, you know, I feel -- it makes me feel complete.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Her late grandfather, Walter Green Jr, was a former military man, and employee of RCA and a body guard for the great boxer, Jersey Joe Walcott.\\n\\nJONES:  He was just like the protector.  If you need anything, you go to Mr. Dynamite.  That was his nickname.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He was also a man who believed in being part of the community.  When Tawanda was 15, she was asked to lead a local drill team.  Unfortunately, it soon lost its funding.  Walter purchased uniforms and drums to get it its start.\\n\\n(CHANTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Today, CSS, the Camden Sophisticated Sisters Drill Team, which includes the distinguished Brothers in Taps, the almighty percussion sound, have over 320 participants.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[19:30:00]  JONES:  Good job, babies.  Good job.  Clap it up for yourself.  Clap it up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWe meet at stalwart Tony & Ruth Steaks, still doing what they do.\\n\\nJONES:  It doesn\\'t get any better than this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was Camden like back in the good ole days?\\n\\nJONES:  Oh, my god.  It was so different coming up when I was younger. I didn\\'t have to work about my life being threatened coming outside. The neighborhood, everybody knew everybody.  That sense of community was strong back then.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were talking about your childhood as if it was a real long time ago.  It\\'s not that long ago.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nJONES:  All right.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What the hell went wrong?\\n\\nJONES:  People can blame it on the politics, but I think that\\'s too easy.  Many have failed our children but it\\'s up to the parents to really start getting more involved in the kids\\' education.  You know, know what your child is doing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re putting it principally on the parents.\\n\\nJONES:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is tasty.\\n\\nJONES:  This is delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So the conventional wisdom seems to be, get out of Camden. Why are you still here?\\n\\nJONES:  Because the need is still in Camden.  If every decent person leaves Camden, then we never a chance.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nJONES:  In order to be a part of the program, they have to maintain a \"C\" average or better.  It\\'s all about the academics.  It\\'s all about nurturing these kids.  What\\'s right, what\\'s wrong, you know.  The drum team does that.  They have different things they go by every day.\\n\\n(CHANTING)\\n\\nJONES:  They believe this.  They say it so much until it is embedded.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tawanda has helped CSS support it with financial assistance, some fundraising, temporary help and donations from small businesses.  Surprisingly with a group of a national profile no lasting support from official organizations or national institutions, public or private.  Yet, she perseveres.\\n\\n(on camera):  A lot of your practices are done outdoors?\\n\\nJONES:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All weather type of a situation.\\n\\nJONES:  Yes.  We\\'ve been under bridges, everything.  Over 28 years, we\\'ve been outside.  Their safety is the most important to me, but it\\'s been a blessing and a curse.  You\\'ll have the corner boys come up and ask you are you having practice outside today.  I\\'ll say yeah, and they\\'ll say, today is not a good day.  I\\'m like, OK.  All right. Thank you very much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s nice.\\n\\nJONES:  Right.  I appreciate it.  Trust me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you keep the kids off the corner?\\n\\nJONES:  I\\'m quite aware that times are hard, but I just try to show them an alternative route.  There\\'s so much more out there than this. Some call me major pain, but it\\'s all out of love.  They need to discipline in life to go to work, to go to school.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re doing it because it\\'s fun.\\n\\nJONES:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But it\\'s hard.  And they\\'re doing it.\\n\\nJONES:  Yeah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re asking people to do a hard thing and they\\'re doing it.\\n\\nJONES:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And I got to ask, I\\'m going to guess in the years that you\\'ve been doing this you\\'ve had to have had your heartbroken many times.  You\\'ve had to see kids that you\\'ve really believed in fall by the wayside and I\\'m guessing a lot.  How do you go on?\\n\\nJONES:  We have a lot of sad stories, but our good outweighs the bad. I keep going just for that reason.  You know, before I was a little hard on myself and I used to think that I could save all the kids, I know that\\'s not the case.  I just do the best that I can do.  And I just pray the next kid doesn\\'t fall by the wayside.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you not become cynical?  Do you harden your heart?\\n\\nJONES:  No, actually, I have to replenish myself or I\\'m not going to be good to them or my own family.  These kids are precious cargo to me.  Some of them have the responsibility of a 30-something-year-old. They\\'re holding down their homes and they\\'re only kids.  No kid should have to go through that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  25 years down the road, what do you think Camden is going to be like?\\n\\nJONES:  I\\'m praying that it turns into the Camden that I remember, and I know that I\\'m helping our future leaders to become a part of that change.  There\\'s no doubt in my mind that there\\'s going to be a positive Camden.  No doubt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:   You\\'re going to stay?\\n\\nJONES:  I\\'m not going anywhere.  My pop-pop didn\\'t leave.  I\\'m not leaving.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Yeah, I know.  Philadelphia is right over there, right across the Ben Franklin Bridge, the center of the cheesesteak universe, but what if it isn\\'t?  They\\'re better than that. They\\'re bigger than that.  And the best cheesesteak in the area might well come from New Jersey.\\n\\nDonkey\\'s, opened by Leon Lucas 71 years ago.  A heavyweight contender in the 1929 summer Olympics in boxing, he was known in his time of the cavalry as the Donkey.\\n\\nROBERT LUCAS, OWNER, DONKEY\\'S:  They said he got kicked by a mule.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  His son, Robert, runs the joint now.\\n\\nThis is what they do here.  Behold, the Jersey cheesesteak.\\n\\nLUCAS:  Pleasure to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So this is the best cheesesteak in south Jersey, unless I\\'m mistaken?\\n\\nLUCAS:  New Jersey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  New Jersey, period?\\n\\nLUCAS:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there a difference between Jersey style and Philadelphia style?\\n\\n[19:35:11]  LUCAS:  We do ours on a round poppy seed Kaiser roll.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really.  I\\'ll have one of those.  That\\'s the way to go. Anything I need to know?\\n\\nLUCAS:  No.  A regular, just cheese and onions.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful.\\n\\nLUCAS:  I need one, boys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s round.  It\\'s got steak, spices, browned onions, real American cheese, such as it is, and a poppy seed roll.\\n\\n(on camera):  Fantastic.  Thank you, sir.\\n\\n(voice-over):  And it is sublime.\\n\\n(on camera):  Relish, what do you think?\\n\\nLUCAS:  Hot pepper, a little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A little bit?  I drove a long way for this.  I was thinking about it the whole way.  Man, this should be like national landmark right away.  This sandwich\\n\\nis unbelievably good.\\n\\nLUCAS:  Thanks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really a thing of beauty.\\n\\nLUCAS:  That\\'s a good thing to here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nLUCAS:  We get a lot of people from Philly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No way.  Philly?\\n\\nLUCAS:  Sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  That\\'s treason.  Do they change their plates on their car or wear a disguise?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nLUCAS:  The poppy seeds help.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, I like this role.  It\\'s awesome.  It\\'s delicious.  I think we\\' got something here today.  Jersey cheesesteaks, I\\'m not saying they\\'re better than Philadelphia -- yeah, I am actually.  This is great.\\n\\nLUCAS:  Glad you enjoyed it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[19:40:18]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  The forests and empty spaces of New Jersey are vast and often empty of everything but legend.  You live here if you like a quieter life of not being messed with.  1.2 million acres of Atlantic cedar, swampland, forests.  It goes on and on, seemingly, at times, forever.  It\\'s easy to get lost.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When I was a kid, as we passed through the pine barrens on the way to the shore, we\\'d joke about Pineys, the strange, possible inbred tribes of people who lived out there --\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- somewhere between the trees.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s what we believed anyway.\\n\\nPaul Evans Peterson, jeweler, musician, author, and proud Piney.  We meet at the disconcertingly friendly Lucille\\'s in Warren Grove for a delicious breakfast.  PAUL EVANS PETERSON, MUSICIAN, AUTHOR & \"PINEY\":  The legend of the\\n\\nNew Jersey devil was Mother Leeds had 12 kids.  Found herself pregnant with a 13th and said, may this child be a devil.  There\\'s many legends told about it.  That legend says that when the Jersey devil was born, it morphed into this creature and flew up the chimney in the night. Other legends say it killed everybody in the room.\\n\\nIt\\'s supposed to have the head of a horse, wings of a bat, hooves. People have seen horns on it.  It breathes fire.  It has a real long tail with a triangle on it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It sounds like My Little Pony with a fork tail. It doesn\\'t sound frightening to me.\\n\\nPETERSON:  It\\'s supposed to have big red eyes some people say the head of a goat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A goat is a little bit scarier.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s out there?  Who are Pineys?  Do they roam the forests at night searching for souls to capture?\\n\\nPETERSON:  No.  No.  Pineys are people who live in the pine barrens. They was a time long ago that if you would have called somebody like that a piney, they got shot.  Now people embrace it.  People like to be thought of as living off the land.  They have bumper stickers now, Piney Power.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you make your living?\\n\\nPETERSON:  It is good to farm blueberries and cranberries.  A lot of fishing, a lot of clamming.  Hopefully, the oystering is coming back in the Delaware Bay.  The bay supported a lot of jobs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The pine barrens have settled it for a long time.\\n\\nPETERSON:  A long time.  Some of the first people who came here were the glass makers.  It\\'s all the incredible sand we have here called sugar sand.  It\\'s pure white and it is perfect for making glass, to the point where it didn\\'t have to be washed or processed any other way.  There were hundreds of glass workers.  They\\'re just ruins now.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s not like the rest of Jersey here.\\n\\nPETERSON:  No, and I hope it stays like that.  It\\'s like a Jersey unto itself.  Like here, like you saw.  It\\'s a long drive to get anywhere.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s good, by the way.  That\\'s really good.\\n\\nPETERSON:  Ain\\'t it great?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[19:47:57]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  You want to talk mythic, epic, storied, that sort of thing?  Welcome to Asbury Park, wellspring of American music of a certain kind.  Home to, yes, the Boss, and the Jersey national anthem, \"Born to Run.\"\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Little Stephen, but before them there was this man, Southside Johnny, who pretty much created the template for the Jersey sound.  And it could have only been this place that changed music and lyrics forever.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n(on camera):  Asbury Park, it\\'s had a reputation as being a happy hunting ground for musicians because what?  A lot of bars?\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY, SINGER & MUSICIAN:  A lot of bars.  It just was a tradition of dance pleasure.  When is funny because the town was started not to have alcohol and not that kind of music, but after awhile, the pressure was too much for entertainment for people to come here, and it morphed into an R&B and rock and roll history.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Most bars don\\'t hire musicians.  They don\\'t hire bands. They\\'re too much trouble --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  This is the Jersey shore.  The Jersey shore means people want entertainment.  It\\'s not just hard-drinking people. People are here on vacation in the summer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Atlantic City didn\\'t have that reputation?\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  Well, we\\'re not Atlantic City.  We\\'re Asbury Park.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  As I always like to say, good is good forever. Great music, great songs, and a classic Jersey sandwich.  And at Frank\\'s, they honor that New Jersey tradition with assertive layers of sliced ham, provolone, tomato, onions, shredded lettuce.  You have your roasted peppers in there.  And most important, your oil and vinegar that marries it all together into a soggy, glory vehicle of deliciousness.\\n\\n(on camera):  Here we go.  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Enjoy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s such a beautiful thing that they shred the lettuce and everything.  You used to come here as a kid?\\n\\n[19:50:01]  SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  Yeah.  My father would order a pastrami sandwich and I\\'d eat a third and he\\'s eat the rest of it.  Then my brother would eat eggs and bacon.  So we had to order what he liked. He was a real trencherman.  He could really eat.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Asbury Park, like its close cousin, Atlantic City, with whom it had so much in common, suffered much the same problems.  14 years ago, last time I came, it was a shell of itself, dying, the beaches empty, a sad and forlorn place.  Unlike Atlantic City, Asbury Park fought to fix itself to become again the kind of place that anybody would want to live in.  They didn\\'t look for a magic bullet like casino gambling.  To a great extent, they succeeded by keeping alive what made Asbury Park special.  They hung on to what was important.\\n\\nLike this place, where any overgrown child still wants to play.\\n\\n(on camera):  Thank god.  What?  Tilt.  Oh.  No, way.  That\\'s delicate.\\n\\nCome on, hit, baby.  Hit.  Oh, man.  Oh.\\n\\nThis is important for children.\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  I think so.  Your first exposure to racy images of women are all set in some sort of 20s fetish alternative universe. And it teaches you shame and humility when you lose.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Exactly.  The limits of how much you can break the rules before it tilts.\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  I think they should have tilt for all sorts of things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think so, too.\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  You step over the line in a bar talking to a young lady, tilt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tilt.\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  That way you know you got to start again.\\n\\nOh, I tilted it already.  I barely touched it.  What are you talking about?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s what they all say.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nSOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:  Oh, god.  Let me play!\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[19:56:17]  BOURDAIN:  As I like to say, good is good forever.  The Atlantic Ocean will always be magnificent.  Looking at it, always a humbling, even educational experience.  It teaches us that men come and go.  But no matter how foolish or outsized their dreams, how badly they screw up, what we do here at the ocean\\'s edge, the sea will outlast us.  Will always draw us to her edges.  When necessary, it will crush us.\\n\\n(on camera):  We look at the Taj, completely oblivious to everything going on around her.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:   And that has got to be the most butt-ugly building ever.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I noticed last night that some of the lights on the sign of the building are out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  It\\'s like truck.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Something like that.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Or tump.  Or rump.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is perfect, actually, if you think of Trump as carnival barker.  His operation is designed to attract ruse and empty.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sort of a perfect metaphor here.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I hate sweets.  But I\\'m a sucker for nostalgia.  You can\\'t go back.  I can\\'t go back.  How I wouldn\\'t, even if I could.  I sure don\\'t want to ever have to be a teenager again. But those tastes and smells of childhood, they work still.\\n\\nYou\\'re telling me you were not a big saltwater taffy fan.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I remember it was hard to chew.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You had braces, remember?  This was probably problematic for it.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know.  I can\\'t remember having braces at that point.  BOURDAIN:  I don\\'t like candy generally but these have a mystical hold\\n\\non me.\\n\\nEven the color of the wrapper has this weird, you know, like there should be music playing in the background.\\n\\nMolasses, I remember that.  Getting a bunch of those.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why.  Certain flavors really resonate.  The peanut, I know exactly what that tastes like.  I remember the vanilla.  Really powerfully.  I\\'m not even a vanilla guy.  I\\'m more of a chocolate guy.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  I think I remember pink ones.  They must have had strawberry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Winter green I remember.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Licorice sounds good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Peppermints.  Keep these in the car.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Looks like cookies and cream.  Does it melt?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a lot of taffy.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This stuff isn\\'t bad for you.  Eat as much as you want.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  Is it gluten free?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s all natural.\\n\\nCHRIS BOURDAIN:  That\\'s what I thought.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Atlantic City will never die.  Good is, indeed, good forever.  And Atlantic City will be great again, Asbury Park, Camden, all of my home state.  I\\'m convinced when the tide has come and washed all the greed heads away, we\\'ll once again be magic. I hope I\\'m there to see it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[21:00:16]  PAUL THEROUX, NOVELIST, ESSAYIST, TRAVEL WRITER & HAWAII RESIDENT:  My great fear as a kid was the fear of failing.  And that\\'s Hawaiian because I was born that way because that\\'s expectation. You\\'re Hawaiian, you\\'re going to be less.  You\\'re Hawaiian, you\\'re going to feel more.  And so it\\'s old.  It\\'s in you.  It\\'s part of your identity.\\n\\nBut when I navigate a voyage, I know when the storm comes and it\\'s going to take you to the bone.  And if the storm keeps coming, you\\'ve got to stand up.  That\\'s just what you\\'ve got to do.  And it\\'s this zone where you learn to make fear your best friend.  You hold it really close to you and you open up the door to believing that you can make it.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  Hawaii is America, as American as anything could possibly be, yet it also never shed what was there before in the layers and layers that have come since.  It\\'s a wonderful, tricky, conflicted, mutant hell rod (ph), and what, for lack of a better word, you\\'d have to call paradise.\\n\\nTHEROUX:  No man\\'s paradise.  Paradises don\\'t exist.  Paradise is kind of in your head.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Wait a minute.  You look at your window here. You look at those hills, those mountains, all that green, that blue sky, the gen-clear sea, it sure looks like paradise to me.\\n\\n(voice-over):  This guy knows.  He\\'s been everywhere.  He\\'s Paul Theroux, novelist, essaying and legendary travel writer.  Of the all the places he\\'s been, all the places he\\'s seen, he chose Hawaii to live, and he\\'s lived here for 25 years.\\n\\n(on camera):  Does it matter that it\\'s America?\\n\\nTHEROUX:  It\\'s the big thing that it\\'s America.  It has elements of the third world.  The nicest elements of the third world, which is the self-respect, the pride.  There\\'s things that don\\'t work at all.  And then it\\'s mainstream USA.  Where we are now, I mean, there\\'s PTA meetings here.  They get together and watch the Super Bowl and it\\'s the most Main Street USA as much as you will find.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Town is a neighborhood spot in Honolulu\\'s Kamokada (ph) district and as Hawaii is the only state in the union that allows day boat fishermen to sell to restaurants, the pan-roasted mahi-mahi is pretty damn good.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s not a particularly welcoming or friendly part of the world.  Contrary to the sort of the aloha myth.\\n\\nTHEROUX:  No, that\\'s right.  That\\'s right.  But no island is. Nantucket isn\\'t.  The island of Hawaii isn\\'t.  The Isle of Wight. Name an island that wa, want foreigners there?  Sicily.  They want foreigners there?  No way.  Did anyone come to an island with a good intention?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, never in this new world.  Best case in the world, bring syphilis.\\n\\nTHEROUX:  Yeah.  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pretty much.  I mean, at the very least.\\n\\nTHEROUX:  Yes.  Captain Cook put his sailors ashore, just to look northwest of here.  He was the first hali (ph).  Like Magellan. Hawaii killed its first tourists.  The Philippines killed their first tourist.  But people on the islands born on the islands view anyone who comes ashore with suspicion.\\n\\nTo go back to what defines a Hawaiian, maybe we should go back in our imaginations, it could have been 2,000 years ago.  The Tahitians had this voyage way before any other culture was exploring the deep seas. Somehow, yet, someplace in the South Pacific, the single most isolated archipelago in the planet.  Fast forward to Captain Cook and his identification of a native Hawaiian, you get a glimpse that these are very productive people.  They\\'re industrious, healthy, strong.  They had time for the arts.  That was a large population, more than half of what we have in Hawaii today.  Fully sustainable, because there was no other choice.  So over time, the native Hawaiian population goes to 22,000.  It\\'s the same story.  Introduced disease, the inability to deal with it, people die.  1926, the public school system would outlaw language and the practice of culture in public schools.  So the road to extinction is being well paved.\\n\\n[21:05:44]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Between Captain Cook\\'s arrival in 1778 and today, disease wiped out most of the population. Missionaries came.  A booming sugar and pineapple plantation industry. An influx of immigrants from Japan, Okinawa, China and the Philippines.  There was the overthrow of Queen Liluokalani.  And the U.S. takeover of the Hawaiian government.  World War II.  And finally, statehood.\\n\\nThe geographical realities of being thousands of miles from, well, anywhere else, has given Hawaii, to some degree, protection from the forces that eradicated so many other South Pacific cultures entirely. In fact, they\\'ve arguably been holding back the inevitable creed better than just about anyone.\\n\\nWhat Hawaii looks like today depends on which island you\\'re standing on and, to some extent, the reputation of the locals.\\n\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are not a monolith.  Islands, that\\'s plural, and we\\'re talking eight very different islands with very different identities.\\n\\nIt\\'s been over a century since the waves of immigrants began and things got all mixed up in the best possible way.  There\\'s layers. And a simple question like, who is Hawaiian, gets you all kinds of answers.\\n\\nThe neighborhood of Kalihi is far cry from the Hawaii that most people know.  And Ethel\\'s have been a go-to of a very specific kind the last 40 years.\\n\\nANDREW LE, CHEF, THE PIG AND THE LADY:  It\\'s the blue collar town. They all come here.  Breakfast, lunch.  Every day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m joined by two local chefs, Mark Naguchi, of Mission, known by some as the Gooch.  His second generation Japanese.  And Andrew Le, of the Pig and the Lady.  He\\'s first generation Vietnamese American, or would that be Vietnamese-Hawaiian?  As you\\'ll see, it gets complicated.\\n\\nMARK NAGUCHI, CHEF, THE MISSION:  I actually cooked on the east coast for three years and people would always be like, are you from Hawaii? You\\'re Hawaiian?  I said, no, I\\'m second-generation Japanese.  They\\'re like, if you\\'re from Hawaii, that makes you Hawaiian.  I was like, no. What I realized like, here in Hawaii, we identify ourselves ethnically versus geographically.  There\\'s no way we would call ourselves Hawaiians.  We would get our asses kicked by a Hawaiian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many generations does it take:  I mean who qualifies as Hawaiian in your view?\\n\\nNAGUCHI:  To me, a Hawaiian is a native of the land.  It\\'s in your blood.  You come from a lineage of native Hawaiian people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s your feeling here?\\n\\nLE:  I do feel like I\\'m Hawaiian in a sense, you know.  It\\'s my place. But culturally, that\\'s a different story.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let me ask you this.  You say you\\'re not Hawaiian.\\n\\nNAGUCHI:  No.\\n\\nWhat\\'s your feeling about Spam?\\n\\nNAGUCHI:  I love Spam\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So you\\'re Hawaiian.\\n\\nNAGUCHI:  I\\'m from Hawaii.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI\\'m born and raised, going to die 808.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The owners of Ethel\\'s are sort of a typical Hawaiian mix, Okinawan, Yoko Shee (ph), aka mom; mainland Japanese husband, Yoichi (ph); and daughter, Anoka (ph), who I guess would be Japanese/Okinawan/American/Hawaiian; and son-in-law, Robert, who is, of course, Mexican.\\n\\n(on camera):  That\\'s pretty.  Ooh, wow, look at that.\\n\\nNAGUCHI:  That looks good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now we are talking.  That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nLE:  I just call it local food.  Local food covers like a wide spread. When I look at this table, it\\'s just Hawaii.  Got Portuguese, Japanese.  Okinawan, World War II.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Korea?\\n\\nLE:  Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian.  Awesomeness.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The food is bone-deep Hawaiian food, my friend, which is to say delicious mash-up, of -- well, look, take taco rice.  It\\'s a dish created in Okinawa to approximate Tex-Mex for homesick American G.I.\\'s that appropriated in a post-ironic way by younger generations of Okinawans and Japanese and it\\'s now found its way back to Hawaii.  Got that?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[21:10:10]  LE:  Identifying and seeing my best friends who were native Hawaiian, helped me to realize the pride of being from Hawaii, understanding the Hawaiian culture.  Living it.  Possibly being part of Japanese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s still a movement to a sovereign --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s strong movement.  So if fighting broke out, which side are you on?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You don\\'t have to think about that.\\n\\nNAGUCHI:  I would joke about it.  If like, me and Hawaii.  I am back and Uncle Sam and were like, no, no native Hawaiian only, I\\'m like, everybody needs to cook.  I\\'m a cook.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI have worth!\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is Ninoa Thompson.  In 1976, along with a number of similarly heroic Hawaiians, he did a very difficult, very important thing.  Before 1972, it was generally assumed, even insisted upon, that Hawaii had been settled originally by some random savages who maybe drifted over accidentally from South America.  It certainly couldn\\'t have been ancient Polynesians.  They couldn\\'t possible have been the kind of sophisticated navigators who could guide a sailboat willfully across the Pacific, across thousands of miles of open water.\\n\\nNINOA THOMPSON, HAWAII:  Nobody could see the canoe.  No dreams.  No hope.  Can\\'t see.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Polynesian Voyaging Society, with the help of crew members like Ninoa Thompson, set out to prove that\\'s what did happen.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  There were those in the community that loved this, prayed for the canoe.  Because they sensed the change.  You have this 62- foot, 12-ton voyaging canoe.  It was powerful.  It changed everything.\\n\\n[21:15:12]  BOURDAIN:  The hokulaia, a double-hulled sailing canoe, a replica of the kind of craft believed to have been used in those times, and only using primitive contemporaneous navigational tools, sailed to 5,500 miles to Tahiti and back.  The trip that helped spark a Hawaiian renaissance, a rebirth of pride and interest in traditional Hawaiian culture and identity.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  The success was monumental.  It changed the view of ancestors as extraordinarily skilled and so we come from them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thomas is a waterman who continues to sail on hokulaia\\'s missions.  Native Hawaiian, his roots go back in the valley 200 years.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  My grandfather was born here.  So I grew up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He spent many years learning traditional Polynesian navigation techniques from a master, now the small Micronesian island.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  This was a man who was chosen by his grandfather.  At one year old, he was put in to be trained and learning the wind and the water and the zone, he was sailing.  He would never say it was some sense of abuse, but, yeah, when the way make the canoe move, the canoe make me sick, my grandfather threw me into the ocean so I could inside the wave.  When I go inside the wave, I become the wave.  When I become the wave, now I navigate it.  So when I approached him.  Said to me, too old.  You want someone to know everything, send his son to my island.  But he said I\\'ll teach you enough to find the island you seek, but I can\\'t teach you the magic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Why do you think it was important to do such a difficult thing?\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  The same story you\\'ll see everywhere in terms of the indigenous people.  My father\\'s mother, nearly pure Hawaiian, chooses not to teach her children language or culture or genealogy.  Where do you come?  Who\\'s your family?  What\\'s your name?  And that could have been 100 generations.  What the voyage did was a reconnection back to feeling wholesome about who you are, because knowing where you come from and who are your ancestors.  So when I got to Tahiti, it was their commitment.  I wasn\\'t our commitment.  It was theirs.  It started to ignite this flame.  It was symbolic.  A bumper sticker, a T-shirt emerges, I\\'m proud to be Hawaiian.  1987, it becomes the first language.  It\\'s mandatory in schools.  Hawaiian culture has to be taught in private schools.  Private schools won\\'t have attendance if you don\\'t teach Hawaiian.  Now it\\'s Hawaiian identity is into everything.  It has to be recognized in everything.  That is powerful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When I mentioned to people, locals in Oahu, Maui, other Hawaiian residents that I was going to Molikai, the response was almost always surprise.  Molikai did not have a reputation for being welcome, that it was dangerous to go over there. That those Molikai dudes were mean, inward-looking, unfriendly, tough as iron and quick to get pissed off.  As it turned out, that was not my experience.\\n\\nWALTER NAKI, FISHERMAN:  So we like to brag that we don\\'t have.  We don\\'t have traffic lights.  We don\\'t have a building over three stories.  We don\\'t have traffic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Nice.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Walter Naki is a skilled fisherman and, today, we\\'re headed out for some octopus.\\n\\nNAKI:  Molikai, it\\'s the friendly island.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  But it\\'s famously not the friendly island. It\\'s supposed to be the most unfriendly island.  I mean, that\\'s what everybody says, right?\\n\\nNAKI:  It depends on how you look at it.  Traditionally, we\\'re here very friendly.  Now, unfriendly is where you go try to come and fix it.  That\\'s when it becomes unfriendly.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThe Molikai before have been -- so we had a lot still in tact.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still?\\n\\nNAKI:  Yes.  But there\\'s always other people that want to come.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Unsurprisingly, fishing rights is an issue around here.  Don\\'t come over here sport fishing the wrong place if you know what\\'s good for you.\\n\\n[21:20:00]  NAKI:  So this is the area.  Nice sandy spot.  OK, ready? Let\\'s go.\\n\\nOK, we are here, man.\\n\\n(INAUDIBLE).  We keep the feeling there, make them feel, not going to take no more.  When he comes right up, stick him.  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Final step, stun the struggling creature with\\n\\na sharp blow from a mallet or, if you want to go old school, bite them right in the brain.  In my case, it took repeated crunching to locate the apparently Chicklet-sized organ.\\n\\nNAKI:  It\\'s going to come to you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This one died eventually, likely by exhaustion, as anything else, I suspected.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:25:04]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  While the sailing canoe the hokulaia was a powerful spark for the Hawaiian renaissance, this is what really set things off.  Beginning in 1941, continuing into the \\'70s and beyond, the U.S. Navy had been using the beautiful neighborhood island of Kaloa as a bombing range.  You could feel the shockwaves as far away as Maui and Molikai.\\n\\nWALTER RITTE, ACTIVIST:  -- Hawaii and nobody\\'s going to tell me any different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  People had never been happy about it.  But emboldened by times and recent events, a group of young activists decided to take a stand.  In 1976, there were a number of attempted occupations of the island in protest of the bombing.  None more successful than Walter Ritte\\'s.  He and fellow activist, Richard Sawyer, sat on the island and refused to leave.\\n\\nRITTE:  One thing, back over there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Managing to evade pursuers for just over a month before finally being arrested in jail.\\n\\nRITTE:  The first to burn down this building and put up (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They emerged, of course, heroes.  And these protests went on to inspire many others to join the movement.\\n\\nRITTE:  I hope I\\'m still alive when that day happens.  Because I want to see our queen back in office.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And embodied the independent spirit, the desire for Hawaiian empowerment and sovereignty that today resonates across generations.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Welcome to what is supposedly the most unwelcoming place in Hawaii.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Come in.  come in.  My name is Hanuhanu.  BOURDAIN:  Thank you so much.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Nice to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Please come inside.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aloha.\\n\\nThis is Kahobnui (ph) fish pond, a shared community space with a sacred history.  Hanuhanu is the caretaker of the fish pond.  He\\'s a local community leader here on Molikai.  Also here is the famous Walter Ritte.\\n\\nRITTE:  Everyone knows how valuable this is because we can see what happened to the rest of the island.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Essentially an old school fish farm.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  800 years old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  800 years old.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Modernizing one old idea and an ancient idea simple as feeding your community.  This, the island you\\'re on, this place could feed over a million people back in the day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You hear the word again and again on Molikai. Ina, which means land and translates to that which feeds you. Springs, mountains, rivers.  These lands, these fish ponds were managed by their ancestors as a sacred trust.  Here where fresh water from the mountains and fast-moving oceans waters met, early, sustainable clean fish farms.  Something in modern times we\\'re still struggling to figure out.\\n\\nRITTE:  People think about us.  The true story is that we have a place of abundance and trying to protect it.  Trying to protect all of these things we\\'ve been trying to protect for the last 30 years and it\\'s getting harder and harder.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Every single one of these Hawaiians over here, get enough evidence that the state of Hawaii, the Department of Land and Natural Resources have done a terrible job.  We\\'re not even looking for blame. We\\'re looking for an agreement for today.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  We all are going to be pono.  We\\'re all going to be righteous and good.  Our planet is in such bad shape that being environmental, being green is trending.  That\\'s how Hawaiians have always been.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who gets to be Hawaiian?  Is it the question, who is Hawaiian?  HANUHANU:  Hawaiian is a nationality.  You can be Hawaiian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really, come on.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t shit me now.  I have to be born here.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come on.  This is a different story.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  I can give you the best explanation.  You cannot be our blood.  Our blood is kanapa.  You cannot be kanapa.  Hawaii is our nationality.  You can be that.\\n\\nYou see this what we\\'re standing on, our ina, it matters so much that if you love this place and you don\\'t want to develop it, destroy it, abuse it, we\\'re on the same team.  If you, eye this place as a money- making vehicle for yourself, we enemies.  Right?  And it doesn\\'t matter what race, religion, what sex.\\n\\n[21:30:00]  HANUHANU:  If you love this place and the way we love it and our ancestors loved it, oh, we can be more than friends but we can be family.  I\\'m going to aloha you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautifully put.  Wow.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right on, bro.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s a pretty impressive spread of food for such a supposedly surly group.  Slow roasted pig, grilled kala fish, mullet cooked lavala (ph) style.  And of course, octopus, known as squid luau.  Fresh poi.  You\\'ve got to have it fresh.  Believe me.  Makes all the\\n\\ndifference in the world.  Fresh water snails called, I believe, hivine (ph) harvested from streams way up in the mountains.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Up in the mountain.  Squid.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That\\'s octopus?  Oh.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I recognize you.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nHANUHANU:  When somebody steals this, it\\'s easy for us to say, you\\'re stealing our stuff.  Right?  But all of this stuff is dependent on what healthy environment and eco-system.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let me ask you just, because I\\'m a bit of a dick, I have to ask.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have to ask.  All right.  So we have like 12 more beers. And I pull out some nice masubi (ph).\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nHANUHANU:  I would eat them.  Look, I would eat them.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s what I feed my children.\\n\\n(LAUGHER)\\n\\nOur culture made everything we did the best of the best.  Hawaiians are the only ones that turned taro root into poi.  We\\'re doing everything.  The best of the best.  You introduce Span to us, we\\'re doing our best.  You introduced Christianity to us, we\\'re going to do the best.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our Christianity is better than yours.  I love it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So disappointed, no way lived up to your reputation, mean, inward-looking, hostile.  Admit it.  It\\'s a calculated strategy.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  It is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And leave the message, if you\\'re watching this show, I hope your heart is swelling with admiration.  The bottom line, don\\'t come here.\\n\\nHANUHANU:  Yeah!\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  The ocean is all around for thousands of miles.  A humbling feeling knowing, at all times, the ground upon which you live and breathe is but a tiny speck in the middle of all this.  So in Hawaii, the water man, is an important distinct.  It expresses\\n\\nthe shared consensus you\\'re able to handle yourself in the ocean no matter what it throws at you.  It implies you\\'re capable of almost mythical things.  The ability to live in the water, handle it\\'s many moods above or below the surface.\\n\\nMeet Uncle Ross, waterman, a canoe-surfing legend and generally accepted ambassador of the aloha spirit.  He\\'s offered to share with me the truly ancient Hawaiian space found only on the face of a crashing wave.\\n\\nSurfing, a life connected to the ocean, just spending time with family and friends on the beach, some of the cornerstones of Hawaiian life.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS, WATERMAN, CANOE SURFER:  This is our chef.  This is Jason\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Hi.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Tony, that\\'s Kiola.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How are you?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Loni.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you do.  How are you?\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Kiave.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hi.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Megan (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hello.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Those are my two daughters.  This is my wife, Felicia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hello, how are you?\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Brendan, come say hi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hey, Brendan, how are you.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Milton.  This is Milton.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Milton, good to meet you.\\n\\nHow does everybody know each other here?\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  We live on an island.  Everybody knows everybody.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  Why do I even ask?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think I met Uncle Ross through the water. Surfing, we became like family.  He\\'s like my dad.  My ohana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Each and every weekend, Ross can be found here, with his ohana, a Hawaiian word that describes an extended circle of family and close friends.\\n\\n(on camera):  Nice.  Got lucky today.  It\\'s a beautiful day.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  Beautiful day.\\n\\nEven when it\\'s storming, it\\'s nice on the beach.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNCLE ROSS:  And we\\'ll stay here until that thing goes down, hits the horizon.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWhen the sun hits the horizon, it\\'s time to go home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Maui is an island as beautiful as it gets and, sure, it\\'s got share of portion-controlled cruise line entertainments doled out and digestible bites and complementary Mai Tais, but you\\'ll also find a sort of beloved institution like Tasty Crust, as local a place as you\\'re likely to find.\\n\\nDaniel Akitahito will explain.\\n\\nDANIEL AKITAHITO, JOURNALIST & FOUNDER, CONTRAST MAGAZINE:  This is a situation I can order for you and you trust me.  I think we\\'ll hook you up with the local flavor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  OK, I trust.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Raised on the big island, he\\'s a journalist, the first Hawaiian editor of a major surf publication and founder of the local \"Contrast\" magazine.\\n\\n[21:40:00]  AKITAHITO:  Local culture is very much so trying to point a finger at anybody coming going, hey, you don\\'t belong.  Therein kind of lies a little conflict we have of being a modern-day Hawaiian.  And I still think that\\'s something that we forget about these days is how educated and how accepting our ancestors were.  It was always built on inclusivity, aloha.  Aloha is giving without expecting anything in return.  You\\'ve got this Hawaiian culture that was a product of the Polynesians that populated the islands and then you have this local that\\'s a product of the plantation lifestyle, so the Japanese, the Chinese, the Koreans, the Filipinos, the Portuguese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Indeed, all history can be explained what\\'s on your plate. This is a prime example.  Behold, bitches, the plate lunch.  The most identifiable and essential feature of the plate lunch is this, a big scoop or two of white rice and potato-mac salad.  There is nothing more Hawaiian.  Served along side a protein, like chicken catsi (ph), or this hamburger steak, burger-like patty drowned in dark sinister sticky, shiny gravy.  Or vodokakiari (ph), seared hahi (ph) with nori and sesame seeds.\\n\\nAKITAHITO:  Oh, my gosh, that looks beautiful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yeah, that\\'s going to work.  All right.  I sit this right on top of the rice.\\n\\nAKITAHITO:  Yep.  Get some of that salad on there too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Get that sinister gravy on.\\n\\nThey may not be Hawaiian, but they are now.  They\\'re fundamentally local.  I mean, this food, the most delicious, let\\'s be honest, delicious.  This is not healthy eating.\\n\\nAKITAHITO:  We\\'re kind of paying the price for it right now in the health of the state, which is terrible.  As I take a bite of a hamburger.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As I said, just so good.\\n\\nAKITAHITO:  If you really want to do Hawaii right, you\\'ve got to get that.  That\\'s a power that Hawaii and the ina has is that, if you show aloha and you give without asking, the ina is going to recognize it and shower its blessings upon you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you think traditional Hawaiian culture and lifestyle has a chance against the modern world?\\n\\nAKITAHITO:  I think so.  The beautiful part about my ancestors is they realized there was a limited number of resources where they lived, so they observed nature to the best possible they could to figure out what were the cycles and how do we preserve this resource?  Hawaiian culture can teach the whole world something that it needs to know, is that we all live on an island.  And we are all part of the same community.  Let\\'s all show aloha to the ina and show aloha to everybody else as well.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[21:46:49]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  An extraordinary man lives in this house, Shep Gordon, long time resident on Maui, legendary talent manager.  Maybe you know some of the people whose careers he\\'s looked after: Alice Cooper, Teddy Pendergrass, Luther Vandross, Blondie, Pink Floyd.  He was years ahead of the chef exPLOsion, shepherding Emeril through his career.  He\\'s produced films, worked alongside great French chefs like Roger Velshae (ph), became close to His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.  Basically, done everything with everybody in every place.\\n\\nSHEP GORDON, TALENT MANAGER & HAWAII RESIDENT:  I first got here 40 years ago.  I put one foot on the island and I knew I was living here the rest of my life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Do you ever look out there and it\\'s wallpaper?  GORDON:  Never.  Never. I say it out loud, first words in the morning,\\n\\nthank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, every day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Shep is famously one of the most generous and enthusiastic of hosts, a more stand-up loyal guy you could barely imagine, and no wonder they call the documentary based on his life \"Super Mitch.\"  That\\'s how he\\'s known around the world.\\n\\nHere, he\\'s known that guy who throws great parties.\\n\\nPrep starts early.  With chef\\'s friend, Julio, a Maui-born-and-bred rancher, with help from local chef, Sheldon Sini (ph).\\n\\nMiddle of the night, in a traditional emudone (ph) filled with lava rocks.  The fire allowed to burn down to coals before the pig, wrapped in combination of banana leaves and tea leaves, is dropped in.\\n\\nJULIO:  OK, you guys ready for the unveiling?  Hold on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  12 hours later, you dig it up and, well, it\\'s party time.\\n\\n(on camera):  What you\\'ve been saying is you\\'ve been drinking steadily since 5:00 this morning?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn\\'t say.  It didn\\'t come out of my mouth.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Behold.  The magnificence.\\n\\nIt\\'s a very important part of your childhood.  Dun, dun, dun, dun. Wow.  Look at that.\\n\\nYou just lift the bones out by hand?\\n\\nJULIO:  Yep.\\n\\nReady?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just dump them in into a bucket.  Awesome.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWow.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  That\\'s pretty much the way I want to end up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPour me into a pot.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER) BOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s lots to do and everyone pitches in to help.  It\\'s an extended, all-day affair of prepping, chopping, dicing, slicing, mixing.  Of course, there is some sampling along the way. Like this wild pig sausage that someone was nice enough to stop by with.\\n\\nSheldon works up a potato-mac salad.\\n\\nSINI (ph):  One more time.  Hit me one more time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Julio carves up unicorn fish, which he caught himself earlier in the day.  Chef Mark Tarbell (ph) stuffs a couple of fresh red snappers before throwing them in the oven.  This poi pounded fresh out back.  And somewhere pig\\'s foot soup is happily bubbling away.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[21:50:13]  BOURDAIN (on camera):  Why do I want to do this?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(voice-over):  There is chili pepper water used for dipping or taken as an auxiliary shot for regularity or for boner medicine or whatever.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yeah.  There is also Spam noodles.  There is no party without Spam.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBy dinner time, the beer, wine and festive beverages have been flowing for hours.  Also, moods have been adjusted, in a completely natural way indigenous to the islands, of course.\\n\\n(on camera):  How about Julio and the Pig?\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have cooked a lot of things.  I ain\\'t never seen one poured into a pot neatly.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nJULIO:  It\\'s what I love.  This is what we do on the island.  This is what it\\'s about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Always bring the ohana, bring the family, bring the kids. You rarely ever see a party where there aren\\'t kids.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ohana means the --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Family.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Extended family.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like you are now ohana to everybody here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we can borrow money from you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  As happens, I have come to find out things end up in the most natural just-kind-of-happens why, song and some dancing.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Willie K.  And that\\'s his daughter, Lisette.  And it\\'s pretty damn captivating.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s getting near the end for me.  And I look over at Shep and see a happy man surrounded by friends, by family really -- his ohana.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:56:12]  THEROUX:  To be Hawaiian to me, there needs to be a sense of connection to a place.  Some sense of responsibility for it.  It should be about being honest to a place, to be honest to what you love and to be honest to what you value is a road that\\'s constantly trying to be more and more informed.  I don\\'t know sometimes how to be fully honest.  I don\\'t know enough.  What I love about the oceans, that\\'s my path way, that I go on the oceans to seek that sense of truth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  They said I can see whales, like close up.  I had reasons for optimism.  All week I had been staring out to sea watching hump-back whales leaping out of the ocean, spouting and frolicking.\\n\\n(on camera):  Are things compared to other parts of the word, are conservation of efforts as far as marine mammal miss if general but whales in particular going well?\\n\\nDR. JOE MOBLEY, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII:  That\\'s the one thing on the planet that is.  They are talking about taking humpbacks off the endangered species list.  It\\'s good to hear they have recovered but then it may make it easy to add to the whaling list again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s mating season in Hawaii for the nearly 10,000 humpback whales that migrate down from southeast Alaska each year.  Dr. Joe Mobley, of the University of Hawaii, has dedicated his career to studying these whales.\\n\\nMOBLEY:  Yeah, I guess the song is supposed to be the most complex display in the animal kingdom.  When you are close, you can feel it through your whole body.  Like 180 D.B., really loud.  Wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  They don\\'t mind us at all, do they?\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh, we got it.\\n\\nMOBLEY:  That was amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That was incredible.\\n\\nMOBLEY:  Unbelievable.\\n\\n',\n",

But I felt that I had to photograph them.\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  You were alive and holding a camera, at a very important time in history.  You had to think, do something important.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s very easy to make beautiful, but pictures mean something, (inaudible).  But that\\'s totally different story\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know these images.  You grew up with them.  They\\'re burned into your brain.  Their iconic sequences, framed, and lift, and seen through the lens in ways that changed filmmaking forever.  All made by the same man.\\n\\nSo, who made these beautiful things?  Where did he come from?  It didn\\'t begin in Hollywood.  It began here, in the streets of Budapest.\\n\\nWhat about his life, his past, his upbringing, led him again and again to look through a piece of glass and make images like these.\\n\\nBut first, some context, and schnitzel -- did I mention schnitzel?\\n\\nIt\\'s beautiful here.  They say that, of course, that Budapest is beautiful.  But it is, in fact, almost ludicrously beautiful.\\n\\nA riot of gorgeous architectural styles, palaces, grand public spaces, former mansions of various princelings, the remains of a long-gone empire still here, still here.\\n\\nIf there was such a thing as building porn, it would be this.  Just looking out the window as you drive or trolley by, you think, I want that?  Who lives there?  Who lived there?  What it\\'s like inside?  And where did they go?\\n\\nFrom high up Gellerd Hill, you get a sense of the layout of the city. Divided, split by the Danube River, Buda on one side, Phest on the other.\\n\\nHungary\\'s capital literally divided in two, historically a crossroads of eastern and westerns worlds.\\n\\nWhich is which now?  Which is Buda and which is Pest?\\n\\nPETER SILAHE (PH), BUDAPEST RESIDENT:  We are in Buda.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  If you can look down, you\\'re always in Buda.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  If you look up to something, then you\\'re in Pest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Peter Silahe (ph) is a Budapest born poet and performance artist.\\n\\nAccording to the myth I was grows up in, if you are in Buda, you\\'re in Europe and the other side is Asia.  This is the border of the Roman Empire, originally, this big river.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right here?\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why they didn\\'t cross?\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  The other -- side is flat, it\\'s hard to defend and there were all these tribes that were vicious and not as civilized as the Romans believed they were.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'ve all been here, the Silts (ph), the Romans, the Mongols, the Ottoman Turks.  All had their way or tried.\\n\\n[21:05:00] All left their mark to one extent or another.\\n\\nThen, mid-19th century, the curious, seemingly improbable Austro- Hungarian Empire, this is when the city came into its own, fueled by untold wealth, accumulated power, and ambition.  Architecturally, intellectually, a great city, one of the world\\'s greatest.\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  And that was a time when Budapest was a really progressive metropolis.  You know, like the first subway in the continent of Europe was in Budapest.  Parliament had, like very sophisticated air-conditioning system.  So people wanted to come, they wanted to live here, wanted to start a career, wanted to build places like this, because it was a good investment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The New York Cafe is one of the last remnants of a society where artists and writers were valued citizens, regardless of financial means.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When this cafe was built, there were more than 500 cafes in this neighborhood.  And this was the biggest and nicest cafe in the world at that time.  Never to be closed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here, like in most cafes at that time, a few cents or a few bucks could buy you space all day long, sipping your coffee, thinking great thoughts.  Nobody would hassle you, it was a petri dish of creativity.  No hipster neck beard barista would make you feel bad about not speaking any dough.\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  Waiters were speaking several languages...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  ... and you read literature, and they invited the writer, occasionally, if he didn\\'t have money, because they appreciated their literature.  Where are we now compared today?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t try that now, of course.\\n\\nToday\\'s New-York Cafe patrons spend both their time and money on things like goose liver terrine, foie gras is all everywhere in Hungary, all over every menu.

It was not simply about the money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it was about?\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  Identity.  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We want to be the place that attracts the best and the brightest.\\n\\nSILAHE (PH):  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even if they don\\'t have money.

That\\'s on deliberate strategy on my part, actually.  It\\'s really a lot like writing porn, after you\\'ve used the same adjectives over and over (inaudible), penthouse letters.

And some, when 11, I saw that I going to look at all with this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So we have -- so butcher make a fan club.  And then I started to write them on Facebook a nearly 10,000 likes on Facebook and they (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s so unusual that there are so many, because in France, in Germany, in the states, the old school butchers who know how to do all of these things, they\\'re disappearing.

We grew up with their works, visual artists, photographers, filmmakers, where did they all go?\\n\\nWell, World War I happened and with it, the end of the Austro- Hungarian Empire.  Budapest and all Europe changed forever.\\n\\nA decades-long wave of emigration began.  A stunning number of the world\\'s great photographers fled their native Hungary and took up new lives.  Eventually, this man joined them.\\n\\nVILMOS ZSIGMOND, LEGENDARY CINEMATOGRAPHER:  I\\'ve been shooting these films since I remember I was living -- I was 5 or 6 years old when I was taking pictures with my father\\'s Kodak camera.  To that moment, you have to capture, and that\\'s the difficult part the exact moment of the story.\\n\\nNow Hungarians, there is this need to excel.  My father was not really an artist.  He was a soccer player, a very good one.  He said, \"Son, whatever you do, you have to be the best at it\".  First, not second, you have to be first, because otherwise it\\'s not worth it.\\n\\nVilmos Zsigmond, legendary cinematographer.  If for some reason you don\\'t know his name, you sure as hell know his work.\\n\\n[21:20:00] The Oscar-winning \"Close Encounters\", \"The Dear Hunter\", his absolutely revolutionary work on \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\", \"The Long Goodbye\", \"Deliverance\".  He created a whole new palette, took crazy risks, changed film language in ways people still try to imitate.  And he\\'s making our camera crew very nervous, I can tell you.\\n\\nYou taught yourself to shoot?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Basically, I always tried to use my father\\'s Kodak camera. (Inaudible) six, it\\'s a kidney disease.  I was in bed for a month and an uncle of mine gave me a book about Eugene Vilovich (ph) was great photographer.  I bought a camera for myself and I started to take just amateur pictures.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One thing that hasn\\'t changed through the years is the Hungarian affection for taking the waters, marinating in thermal baths, a tradition going back to the Romans, continued by the ottomans, and something that survived right through two wars and communism.  And they do it in style.\\n\\nWho came here back in those days?  Was this reserved for anyone who wanted to could come here?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Well, you know, funny when I did but nobody think (inaudible) so everybody could afford basically it was cheap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  In Hungary, we have so many spas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are many bathhouse spas.  Baroque, elaborately wedding cakes, built atop mineral rich hot springs gurgling from the earth.  None more storied than the Geller (ph).\\n\\nSo you arrived in Budapest around age 21.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Age 21.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was the city like then?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  It was always beautiful.  There were ruins after the war, 1945 I think, half of the city was still in ruins.\\n\\n(OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When you first moved here, you go to film school, what was your average day like other than your studies?  What did you do for fun back then?  What were your options?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Our options were zero.  Imagine that we are in the school from little help from the government, very little money, that\\'s good enough to have breakfast and lunch, or breakfast and dinner.  You had to skip many lunch to be able to but a pair of socks.\\n\\nSo we were very, very poor.  But I must say that under this whole thing, the happiest part of my life, under communist, was when I fell in love, immediately.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  fact, some of Vilmos\\' most powerful and world-changing footage occurred around this time, before leaving Hungary, as a film student during the outbreak of revolution, but we\\'ll get to that later.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:25:00]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In many ways, Vilmos Zsigmond\\'s career as one of the great cinematography in film history begins here in Zagat, about 200 kilometers south of Budapest.\\n\\nHere he was raised by his father, who worked many jobs to make ends meet.\\n\\nWeekends in warmer months all over Hungary, wherever there\\'s a river and fish, places like this are thronged with families, and here along the Tisza River is no exception.\\n\\nHere young Vilmos and his dad would come and eat halaszle, the local specialty of fish soup.\\n\\nHow old were you when you first came to this place?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  I must have been about 7 years old.\\n\\nYou know, my father was really great.  Those days, years, actually, he didn\\'t have much time, but occasionally, he wants to take me away (inaudible) away from work.  So he loved this place, actually.  He loved this (inaudible), this fish soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s murky good-looking and need some bread for this, for sure.\\n\\nPike from the river simmered low and slow in a rich fish stock with healthy amount of onions and the near ubiquitous but always good paprika.\\n\\nThat\\'s good, right?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  As I kid, I love that.  Fish taste so good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  During the summer, (inaudible) they open the opens and needed side...\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Then we go and swimming in the river.  It was a great place, used to be a great place for fun.\\n\\nAnd, you know, at night, we used to come here at night, when the gypsies were playing music, and I loved that, actually.  I always loved gypsy music.  Everything Hungarian from -- they had a very happy childhood.\\n\\nIt was good time until the war got in and then stopped all that happiness, you know.  There was just hard times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Were you fully aware of how bad, how grave things were?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Near the end of the war, the Germans came in and then started to bomb us.  And they started to soon take care of Jews, actually, I mean, to work in camps.  That started to be very, very ugly.\\n\\n[21:30:05] BOURDAIN:  For people of your generation, who grew up, these were incredibly insecure times.  Psychologically, what do you think that teaches you as far as a world view?  Do you become more adaptable  Do you become more suspicious?  Do you become more cynical? ZSIGMOND:  It\\'s about survival, actually.  We want to survive as Hungarians to preserve identity as Hungarians, so that\\'s what we did, we survived.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He saw a lot as a young boy, as he would later, as an adult.\\n\\nIn 1944, German tanks rolled into Hungary.  His country was now in the hands of a foreign power, enact for the last time.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  And, you know, it made me think back to my school years.  I almost say those were the happiest years of my life, being under a terrible regime, terrible things happened all along that.  I was (inaudible) studying cinematography.\\n\\nBeing in the film school was like an island of the craziness.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I grew up in New Jersey.  My family was sentimental about beautiful pictures, a beautiful script.  We saw every film you ever shot and talked about them at the dinner table.  These were important.\\n\\nThis is got to look pretty close to the way it is, in the old day, yeah?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Oh, yeah.  Doesn\\'t change much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Through it all for Vilmos, there was this place, however, a very special place for a boy growing up during wartime, the movie house where he saw his first films.\\n\\nSo what memorable films did you see in this theater?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  My probably best experience in my life, I was in Hungary, see \"Chaplin the Dictator\".\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Liberty stunk.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Liberty is odious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible) Stunk.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Freedom of speech is objection.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  (Inaudible) Chaplain did such a great job, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Some films, of course, resonated more than others, the power of the visual image intensified maybe by what was going on just outside that dark room.  Films could be inspiring, but they could be dangerous.\\n\\nIt was so magical to me.  I mean, they ought to go to a film, especially a dangerous one, one that was just the subject matter and the content was different and to see that just, oh, my god, what do I do with my life now after seeing it?\\n\\nThis theater, by the way, is now named in his honor.\\n\\n(Commercial Break)\\n\\n[21:35:00]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When you look at footage you took during the revolution, you\\'re not in those pictures, but do you see yourself?  I mean, do you remember what it felt like?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  I remember that I was actually scared to death.  Shooting actually those Russian tanks, you know, going through there, you know, they can shoot me.  But I felt that had to photograph it.\\n\\nThings were going from one side to the other side of the Danube.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There were tanks coming across this?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Well, yes, actually.  It was a pretty cool, cold day, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Not this cold but it was raining, it was bad weather.  It was pretty much, you know, you could see what was happening in Budapest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After the war, a Cold War.  Hungary now found itself firmly in the grip of the Soviet Union.  Germans had been replaced by Russian commissars and their obedient Hungarian functionaries.\\n\\nYoung Vilmos Zsigmond was now at film school in Budapest learning his craft, along with his best friend who\\'d also go on to become a legendary cinematographer, Laszlo Kovacs.\\n\\nThen in 1956, something amazing happened.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hated emblems of red tyranny went down as Hungarian patriots for ten glorious days sent Russians armored (inaudible) in the struggle which pitted 9in of courage and rifles against tanks.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  You know, lots of the -- that the Statue of Stalin used to be under the first night, actually, when the revolution started, the people wanted to take the statue down.  It took about a couple of hours, actually, to cut Mr. Stalin\\'s legs off.  And actually back in the city, you know, the next day, people took pieces home as a souvenir.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To date, this was something that had never been done.  The Hungarians took to the streets, a revolution.  That\\'s when Vilmos, and Laszlo, and some pals snuck 35 millimeter cameras and film out of their school\\'s equipment room, and at great risk to themselves, joined their countrymen in the streets, documenting the revolt and the aftermath.\\n\\nThese images are from some of that historic footage.  A scene for ten glorious days, that freedom had finally come.  Encouraged by the west and by CIA radio broadcasts in particular, the Hungarians believed that help was on its way, that this was it.  They dug in and fought, hoping to hold out until help arrived.\\n\\nOn November 4th, a desperate plea went out over the air waves.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Hungary calling.  This is Hungary calling. For the sake of God and freedom, help Hungary.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Russians had been beaten back for a time, but now they doubled down with a vengeance, pouring tanks, and troops, and heavy armor back into Budapest and brutally and all too effectively put down the resistance.\\n\\n[21:40:05] Help never came.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  I mean, this is a place where a lot of things happened.  It used to be the secret police headquarters, I never shot this before, so this is about the first time I\\'m going to get this building shot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this was the internal secret police, so if someone came at night with a van and he were taken away, you ended up being interrogated here?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Yes.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Secret police headquarters in 1956, the site of a fire fight between snipers on the roof, and their fellow citizens below.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Then the people got into the building, went up there, hunted them down and killed them, actually, basically, and hanged them on the streets.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hung them here.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Hung them all over the streets.  It\\'s hard to find a tree which they hung those people up there.  Had you see people killed before, before the revolution?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  No.  Very tragic moment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The building is abandoned.  The door, as it turns out, wide open. ZSIGMOND:  Oh, wow.  Oh, look at that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It still feels sad.  A little haunted, yeah?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Those were vicious times, you know, people\\'s life was not really important to these people, they were cruel.  Picking up people at midnight and taking them somewhere and some of them went to Siberia.  They killed so many people after that time, unfortunately (inaudible) they went through the film.  People were in trouble and many were killed.\\n\\n200,000 people left the country at that time, Hungarians.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long did you stick around?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  Almost three weeks, and that\\'s when we realized that nothing is going to be change.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You left Hungary with a lot of kinds of film?\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  As much as we could carry.  We have just enough money to get to America.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:45:00]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The sound track to old Budapest, the ubiquitous gypsy violin, found at one time in every cafe or restaurant.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  It\\'s a hard life that of a professional musician, as true a statement in Budapest as anywhere.  These guys are Budapest bar, an eclectic troupe of extraordinary musicians united by their dedication to that uniquely Hungarian crossroads of gypsy and classical music.\\n\\nSo, what does a band do when the hour\\'s late and some sustenance of perhaps some strong drink is required?  It\\'s back to the flat lead violinist Robbie (ph) and his manger wife, Andrea (ph).  And of course, playing bass, play more music.\\n\\nDo you have to be gypsy to play gypsy music?  No hesitation.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nANDREA (PH):  He says it\\'s very rare that anybody who\\'s not a gypsy can play gypsy music.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nANDREA (PH):  In gypsy music, the whole lifestyle, the whole experience is in and kids start learning it when they are 2 or 3.  By the time you are 8, you have all these ingredients in your blood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:   Margarite Bongo (ph), basically the Aretha Franklin of Hungarian gypsy music, a household name, also a fantastic cook. Extraordinary singing talent does not preclude her from overseeing a classic line up of dishes like chicken paprikash, whole perch roasted in bacon, stuffed cabbage filled with goose meat and slow cooked, and of course, the inevitable goulash.

It\\'s not a good time.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s very bad for the gypsy musicians generally speaking because it\\'s dead.  It\\'s completely -- apart from things like Budapest bar, gypsy music is extinct.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s heartbreaking.  Is sadness an important part of this music?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, Hungary is a country that has experimented a lot of heartbreak.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So it is a lot of heartbreaks.  It\\'s a lot of difficulties, and then...\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And there is another saying that the violin is crying, that the gypsy violin is crying or -- there is another one that even if we have joy we cry, the Hungarian.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight, Vilmos has invited me to the home of his longtime friend and college in the film business, Richie Ram Walter (ph).

That\\'s what we always thought about that certain photography.  Yeah, emphasizing basically the beauty of the things but also I make it more beautiful than it is.\\n\\nWhy is Hungary so strong on photography?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think they are very strong in mathematics, which was in the early days connected to photography.  Vilmos tells me about his education in math, it was totally different than what I thought.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Very good school.\\n\\nZSIGMOND:  That\\'s what I said, that schools in Hungary were very, very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is no kind of an answer to me.

You learn to be an artist.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So if I would ask you that how was dinner?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So deeply delicious.  Thank you.\\n\\nOh, really good, really good, wow.

       " '\\n[21:00:19]  ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  Miami sneaks up on you.  Or do we change and find ourselves sneaking up, washing up, ending up in Miami?\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Miami, it\\'s a big place.  Bigger and more multifaceted than it\\'s given credit for.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Miami, where you at?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We tend over the years to focus on Miami\\'s -- how shall I put this -- party zone.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s the kind of place we say, \"That could never be me,\" and then it is.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a temptation that\\'s almost irresistible, the seductions of flash, of palm trees, balmy nights, deco architecture, the manufactured dreams of many television shows made real.\\n\\nBut across the causeway a few miles down the way there are other worlds, older ones.  I think it\\'s safe to say better ones.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Way out west, 20 miles from the airport, tucked in yet another strip mall, is Islas Canarias.  And you go there because, well, you need coffee, and because Cuba, respect, and because Michelle Bernstein is there.\\n\\n(on camera):  It was a long time getting here.\\n\\nMICHELLE BERNSTEIN, CHEF:  You need a car in Miami.  And yes, this is like the heart of Miami.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Michelle is one of my Miami\\'s most iconic influential chefs, born and bred her.\\n\\n(on camera):  When people say where did you grow up, you say --\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Miami.  This is out west.  You can\\'t get much further west than this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s beyond here?\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Swampland.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, body disposal?\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Well, you can say that.  I can.  This restaurant, we would actually come here for the seafood and it would be elegant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, you have the waiters in the little bolero jacket-type things or a bow tie.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  You should get a bow tie.  Yeah, and there\\'s still some Cuban places in Miami that still have that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is how you drink coffee in Miami.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  In the real places give you the milk first and then the coffee.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What do they call this again, those tiny little --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Colada.  It\\'s a big cup with little cups.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is basically like the coffee version, the caffeine version of a one-hitter.  You\\'re basically, so I\\'d have one of those. At the next place, I\\'d have another.  And I increasingly get jangling as I head towards work or whatever my final destination.\\n\\n[21:05:11]  BERNSTEIN:  I grew up on the colada.  At 4, I had my first, I think, colada.  We all give our babies coffee.  They put their finger in it to taste it and they all grow up loving coffee.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s good.\\n\\nSo this is a nonjudgmental land, Miami?\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  It is.  You can pretty much get away with almost anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good coffee.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  I\\'m so glad you like it because a lot of people don\\'t like it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Well, because they think it is too sweet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And many of you watching who are generally aware of Miami and this sandwich thing they call a Cubano, that you may or may not have had before, you\\'re thinking, yes, a Cubano sandwich, but you\\'d be wrong.  This is not a Cubano sandwich, strictly speaking.  This, my friends, is a megalochick (ph).  Close, a cousin. Like a Cubano, it has roast port, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, a little mustard, and like a Cubano it is pressed until hot and runny inside.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  You see the bread.  It\\'s sweeter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  So you have a real contrast with the salty pickle and the port and the bread.  See how juicy that is?  That\\'s the telling of a sandwich.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It pisses me off.  You know people try to improve on this.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  A lot of people try to improve on it.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  How is it?  Is it yummy?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.\\n\\nA lot of thought is given to the structure of the sandwich.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  It is all about the layers.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nThis is the perfect breakfast, right?\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  It\\'s good, yeah.  I always go for the salty, never the sweet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t care about sweet things.  If I have to give up one course of the meal, it\\'s the dessert.  You know how it\\'s --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheese over dessert any day.\\n\\nBERNSTEIN:  Yes.  I\\'d rather have steak over dessert, but maybe that\\'s because my mother is from Argentina.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nMATT KLEIN, OWNER CLUB DEUCE:  This is my world away from the world. To me, it\\'s my little king\\'s domain.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s one place I keep coming back to.  It\\'s a place where, if you look deep enough, ask the right Questions, you can get a whole history of Miami from one man, this man, Matt Klein.\\n\\nKLEIN:  You\\'re going to have to remember you\\'re speaking to 100-year- old man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I know.  You look good.\\n\\nKLEIN:  Raise your voice a little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You look good.  If I look that good when I\\'m 60, I\\'ll be happy.\\n\\nKLEIN:  You know what the amazing thing about being 100 is?  Last year, I was 99.  Nobody paid attention to me.  Didn\\'t care.  I became 100, my God.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Matt Klein, the owner, proprietor and regular bartender at Matt\\'s Club Deuce, turned 100 years old this year.  Yes, 100.  He\\'s still here.  The cigarette smoke and dark, dank atmosphere, pretty good for a guy that\\'s seen it all.\\n\\nKLEIN:  That\\'s 73 years ago, Fort Benning, Georgia.  I was the 2nd Armored Division.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Matt Klein came to Miami in 1945 from New York\\'s lower east side by way of the battle of Normandy.\\n\\nKLEIN:  I came here because I was wounded and the warm weather was much better for me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  But there was a lot of G.I.s during the war here, right?\\n\\nKLEIN:  The Lord made Miami Beach for the simple reason that people were station here and, all of a sudden, they saw a world that they didn\\'t believe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  During World War II, Miami saw a massive influx of military personnel.  Hotels, which had seen a sharp drop in business, made a deal with the government to house troops at the empty resorts.\\n\\nKLEIN:  They told their parents about it, the parents came down, sons came down.  They opened businesses here, and they were basically Jewish at the time and that\\'s how it started.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By the fall of 1942, more than 78,000 troops were living in more than 300 hotels in Miami and Miami Beach.\\n\\n(on camera):  How long have you been running the Deuce?\\n\\nKLEIN:  I took over in 1964.  Half of my life I\\'ve spent here.  Miami Beach has turned over at least six times since I\\'ve been here.  All that neon is \"Miami Vice.\"  They put it in here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nKLEIN:  This was their favorite bar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It makes sense, too.\\n\\n[21:10:13]  KLEIN:  Still, it was very flattering.  The same as how flattering it is to have you here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I love this place.  I mean I love it.  It\\'s my favorite bar in Miami.\\n\\nTo many more.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The dreamers, the visionaries, crooks and con men who built Miami envisioned many different kinds of paradise, a New Jerusalem in the seemingly infinitely expanding real estate.  Just fill in where there\\'s water and you\\'ve got property, or as in Coral Gables, build a new Venice, complete with a tabloidish (ph) fantasy architecture and grand canals.  Gondolas to ferry the new seekers to their palazzos in the sun.  The dream was as expandable as the space. Where there was water, there was now magically terra-sort-of-firma.\\n\\nAnd in the \\'80s, where there was decline, a vacuum, suddenly, there was a new and vibrant economy, one that raised all boats, filled Miami with new buildings shiny cars, swanky nightclubs, floods of cash, and a new reputation for murder and criminality to go with it.  Cocaine. Say what you will, cocaine altered the skyline of Miami forever.  It made, for better or worse, Miami sexy again.\\n\\n[21:15:11]  (on camera):  Going back to the very beginning, was Miami always a criminal enterprise?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBut I mean that in a good way.  Outlaw culturalism, a very deep part of American culture.\\n\\nBILLY CORBEN, MOVIE PRODUCER:  Nicole Highason (ph) says, in Florida, we don\\'t produce or manufacture anything but oranges or handguns. There is no indigenous industry.  We sell sunshine.\\n\\nALFRED SPELLMAN, MOVIE PRODUCER:  We sell you a dream\\n\\nCORBEN:  The only jobs we have are in hospitality or in restaurants.\\n\\nSPELLMAN:  Real estate.\\n\\nCORBEN:  Real estate.  It is all to sell the dream to the next people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In 1981 the FBI called Miami the most violent city in America.  The drug industry brought in an estimated $7 to $12 billion a year and that was of 1981 money.  That is a lot of trickle down.  One of the most successful documentaries in the history of film is\\n\\n\"Cocaine Cowboys,\" which tells that story.  The film made by these guys, Alfred Spellman and Billy Corben.\\n\\n(on camera):  So things were in decline.  Cocaine sort of saved the city?\\n\\nSPELLMAN:  Well --\\n\\nCORBEN:  We\\'d say so.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAm I going to get in trouble?  Am I going to get in trouble for it? Yes.\\n\\nSPELLMAN:  But by 1981, you had a murder rate here 365 homicides here. 25 percent of those bodies had automatic weapons bullets.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(voice-over):  We talk about the uncomfortable reality of where a lot of the modern Miami came from over something you just have to hit hard when in Miami in season -- stone crabs.\\n\\nCORBEN:  The Federal Reserve branch in Miami had a $5 billion cash surplus, mostly $50s and $100 dollar bills, all of which had trace elements of cocaine on them.\\n\\nSPELLMAN:  And the guys in cocaine trafficking in the \\'70s and \\'80s who got busted and went to prison got out, and are now big Medicare fraudsters.\\n\\nCORBEN:  We\\'re whispering because they\\'re probably here.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So where\\'s the money now?  How\\'s business in general in Miami and where is that business coming from?\\n\\nSPELLMAN:  Remarkably the rebound from the great recession, the people thought it would take a decade for all the condo inventory to get absorbed, and it seemed to happen almost overnight.  By 2010, 2011, things were turned around here.  We\\'re in the middle of another huge boom.  Who is buying?  It\\'s wealthy foreigners, a lot of flight capital from overseas, from Latin, South American, Russians.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If it is money looted from another country, do we care? Trickle down.\\n\\nSPELLMAN:  It has propped up Miami once again with another inflated bubble and the Question is, how long will it last?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s history and there\\'s the more immediate needs of the present.  I need food presently and perhaps some fine bourbon.  And when I need good food in a city not my own, more and more these days, I call somebody who, if they weren\\'t good at enough things already, has become something of an expert on food around the world.\\n\\n(on camera):  Every time I check Instagram, you\\'re eating with one of my culinary heroes.  You\\'ve eaten had gyros --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He seems to like you much better than me.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(voice-over):  Ahmir Khalib Thompson, known to most as Questlove.\\n\\n(on camera):  You\\'ve been to this place before?\\n\\nAHMIR KHALIB THOMPSON, QUESTLOVE:  I live at this place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Yard Bird quickly became a Miami favorite, serving over-the-top Southern classics to well-heeled bonveva (ph) like, well, us.\\n\\n(on camera):  The old joke was that James Brown was the hardest working man in show business.  You make him look lazy.  Let\\'s review, band leader, producer, a teacher --\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  Yep.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- a deejay.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  Technically, I have 16 jobs right now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Devilled eggs with fresh dill and trout roll will be so over next year, but right now, I want 10 more.  Delicious. Fried green tomatoes with pork belly, this is the perfect thing for a guy looking to squeeze into a size 28 Speedo tomorrow and hit the beach.\\n\\n(on camera):  How often are you in Miami?\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  Three to five times a year.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What makes the Miami sound different from the Detroit sound, the Philadelphia sound, the New York sound, whatever?\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  You can\\'t say something specific like, well, Philadelphia has strings in their arrangement whereas Stacks Records had organ in theirs.  But I do consider the sound of Miami to be the beginning of really great dance music.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once called 77 Elvis pancakes?  Chocolate chip pancakes, bourbon maple syrup, banana compote and peanut butter.  Even if you\\'re not the king, you\\'ll want to die on the toilet like he did after this carbo load.\\n\\n(on camera):  If I really want to do the Elvis experience, I should be eating a fistful of Percodan with that.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[21:20:14]  (voice-over):  Yard Bird\\'s signature fried chicken comes with spiced watermelon and cheddar cheese waffles.  Here, they brine the chicken for a day, 27 hours to be exact, in a spicy bath that includes cayenne and black pepper, garlic and onion.  Tender inside and perfectly crispy on the outside.\\n\\n(on camera):  To me, I like waffles and I like chicken, but I don\\'t understand waffles and chicken together.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  You still don\\'t understand?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, look, I understand people deeply love them and I do like waffles and I do like fried chicken.  Put them on separate plates and I\\'m OK.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  You don\\'t want your food integrated?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Shrimp and grits, a southern classic made with Florida shrimp, Virginia ham, and South Carolina stone-ground grits.\\n\\n(on camera):  On the other subject, I was reading your book.  Is it Curtis Mayfield you have bad associations with?\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  Whenever I hear Curtis Mayfield\\'s \"Freddie\\'s Dead,\" just as a kid, that particular structure always frightened me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  \"Aqualung,\" Jethro Tull, I whipped into a murderous rage right away.\\n\\nTHOMPSON:  Even now?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even now.  I\\'m angry that that band ever existed.  I hate that whole Englishy, old, bar minstrelly, stand-on-one-leg mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  I hate that (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You never know when you play music, were they molested by a rodeo clown to that song.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And Jethro Tull is my version of that.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [21:25:33]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Who got here first?  Who, other than, say, some early Native American tribes and Spaniards?  Caribbean blacks, most of whom were Bahamian.  Bahamians figured heavily in the early development of south Florida, which began in earnest with the construction of railroads in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by this guy, Henry Morrison Flagler, the industrialist and tycoon largely credited with being the father of modern Florida.  Flagler\\'s dream was the Florida East Coast Railway, which would run from Jacksonville to Key West, connecting the ports of Miami to the rail system of the rest of the United States, creating along its route new towns, new cities, new places where America\\'s rising middle class could frolic and play. He also agreed to lay the foundation for a city on both sides of the Miami River.\\n\\nAs more and more whites moved in, segregation took hold and much of the Bahamian community was forced into black neighborhoods like Overtown and Liberty City.  So if you\\'re looking for old Miami, original Miami, you\\'re looking, to a great extent, for black Miami.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These days, Liberty City is mostly ignored by developers, but back in the day, it was the epicenter of the black community.  A lot has happened since then.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Pancakes, smoked sausage, boiled eggs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What do you usually get?\\n\\nLUTHER CAMPBELL, RAPPER & OWNER, MLK RESTAURANT:  Oh, man the fishy grits.  See, that\\'s what Bahamians eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Your parents were Jamaican and Bahamian?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Yes, my mother was Bahamian and my father was Jamaican.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Today, I\\'m having fish and grits at MLK Restaurant with this guy, Luther Campbell.\\n\\n(on camera):  A lot of good cooking tradition in the family.\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Oh, yeah.  One night, we\\'d have rice and peas and, the other night, we\\'d have peas and rice.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Otherwise known Uncle Luke or perhaps Luke Sky Walker at various times.  Luther is something of a musical, political and legal legend, credited with pioneering what would be called Miami base.  Maybe you know him from such hits as Two Live Crews\\' \"Me So Horny\" and \"Do Wa Ditty\" or the groundbreaking fair-use Supreme Court Case Campbell versus Acuff-Rose Music.\\n\\n(CHEERING) (on camera):  How do you end up different growing up in Miami than you would have grown up in L.A. and New York?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  A lot of people would have said southern people, whatever you want to call us, in actuality, we\\'re an island town.  I mean, Miami was made up of Bahamians who really filled the city of Miami, so now you have a different culture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  South American and --\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Very different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very, very different.\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How has that mix, how has that impacted the music?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  When people think about me, this guy makes bootie-shaking music.  Everybody is dancing.  Everybody is dancing in a sexual way. Jamaicans, they wind.  The girls are standing up on you.  The girls stand up on you and put your butt on you and start winding.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve seen this on television.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  It\\'s no different than a lap dance.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Among your other accomplishments, you ran for office?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  About 70 percent residents of Miami speak Spanish at home?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Uh-huh.\\n\\n[21:29:52]  BOURDAIN:  Enormous African-American and Afro-Caribbean community.  How come they keep electing conservative white guys?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Those conservative white guys, they\\'re (INAUDIBLE), don\\'t\\' say nothing.  Don\\'t energize your people.  So you have a whole quiet community, you didn\\'t get them excited about voting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s the opposite of get-out-the-vote program, which is don\\'t bother to vote.\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Don\\'t bother to vote.  You take the governor\\'s election. You know African-Americans voted at 20 percent.  If we would have voted at 50 percent, Charlie Crist would have won the governor\\'s race.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you were selling Miami to somebody, what\\'s the best thing about Miami?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  Best weather.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you handle the cold if you have to tour or something in Detroit or Chicago or something?\\n\\nCAMPBELL:  My mind-set is I don\\'t have to deal with this every day. I\\'m going back to sunshine.  I can go into a blizzard.  I know I\\'m going out.  You all stay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is really good.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  Since I was 14 years old, I always wore cowboy boots.  Maybe because my little boy role models were always the men in the black hats.  Richard Boone in \"Have Gun Will Travel,\" Robert Vaughn in \"The Magnificent Seven.\"  \"Silent Killers.\"  Men with pasts.  Men from somewhere else who found themselves in the great American West.  A place where reinvention, a new life was always possible.  As long as you were willing to kill for it.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nThe Western myth has pretty much captured the American imagination. None of us can escape it.  For ages, we identified ourselves with the image of the lone cowboy, the perception of frontier values, self- sufficiency, rugged individualism, the freedom of wide open spaces.\\n\\nFew places in America still manage to embody that mythic landscape of the imagination like the state of New Mexico.  What does freedom mean? It\\'s different things to everybody, it seems, but something about this place manages to catch the overlap between a whole hell of a lot of very different cultures.\\n\\nOld Route 66 runs through New Mexico like a collapsed vein, right through Santa Fe and Albuquerque.  It must have seemed like magic once.  Families loaded in a massive chrome and steel chariots with powerful V8 engines and took off down that black hop highway.  They swept in whimsical motor lodges and bungalows, swam in kidney-shaped pools.  Then it all went redundant.\\n\\nRoute 66 was decommissioned, chopped up, largely forgotten, except by desperate and lazy travel show hosts.\\n\\nDoes anyone else at CNN do this, like drive around at like 10:15 at night looking for tacos?  Yes.  Probably.\\n\\nI\\'ll say this.  The strip takes on a much more interesting look at night.  You can imagine Dennis Hopper huffing nitrous and dismembering somebody over an unrolled tarp in any one of those sinister-looking motel rooms.  Cool.\\n\\nHopefully the tacos first, because after you do the meth you really aren\\'t going to want to eat.  In ancient times, really drivers would hang the testicles of their enemies on their rear-view mirrors.\\n\\nBest-case scenario around here, in my humble opinion, taco truck, of which there are quite a few.  Parking lot, the smell of mystery parts on a griddle, yes.  Knowing my love of all things Mexican, you might expect me to be eating tacos for the next hour.\\n\\nIt\\'s good without the live stance.  Damn you, tacos village.  Come for the vistas, stay for the tacos.\\n\\nThirty rounds per magazine of steel jacketed destruction as fast as your finger can pull the trigger.  You might well ask yourself, why the hell would anybody need a weapon like this?  The AR-15 is one of the weapons most reviled by gun opponents.  It\\'s also America\\'s favorite rifle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I never thought I\\'d say that a guy from New York is a natural when it comes to shooting an AR-15 in New Mexico, but I\\'m impressed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As a nation, we love them.  There are about four million in circulation.  Those are the facts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Basically, AR-15 is a semiautomatic civilian version of an M-16.  And the funny thing is, is that in relation this gun is almost identical to this gun, but this is the one that\\'s evil. Shoots the same caliber, the same magazine capacity, just looks a little different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m an East Coast guy.  I\\'m a New Yorker.  But I come from a place where a glimpse of a weapon on somebody at a bar in the street is reason for panic.  Here, and in much of America in between New York and L.A., you walk into a bar, you see somebody with a weapon, it\\'s like, you know, that\\'s my neighbor, you know, maybe he\\'s going hunting.  Maybe he\\'s -- who knows?  Most of the people you know own guns?\\n\\nMost people you know own guns?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody I know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pretty much everybody.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I had a rifle before I had a baseball bat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Meet Jesse, Bill, Bo, and Daniel.  Pretty much who we are talking about when we see the latest stats on gun purchases in America and shake our heads uncomprehendingly.  That cultural divide, much more than policy, is what\\'s kept the issue of gun control so polarized and so, frankly, hopeless.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He had a gun before he had a baseball bat.  I\\'m in the same situation.  I was shooting a BB gun when I was 5 years old and I knew at that time it wasn\\'t a toy, it was a weapon, and I was very well-educated by my father on the responsible use of that piece of equipment.  And that\\'s what\\'s critical to me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I shoot all the time and I\\'m always trying to shoot better than I did last week.  It\\'s relaxing.  You\\'re out with friends.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s a dark little Genie in all of us, I think, that wants to pick up a gun, point it at something, and blast away.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a new Springfield Arm nine millimeter with 19 round clip.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nI like guns.  I don\\'t own a gun, but I like holding them.  I like shooting them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a Glock .22.  It\\'s cheaper than a 40 caliber.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is something compelling, an eerie rush, an unholy sense of empowerment feeling the warm glow of these heavy iconic shapes in your hands.\\n\\nGet off my lawn, you kids.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s a 357 Magnum.  It\\'s an eight-shot revolver.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bigger kick on this guy.  Yes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You just can\\'t help silently mouthing, \"Make my day\" or \"Feeling lucky, punk.\"\\n\\nYou could do this all day.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWhatever your opinion on the subject, fact is, gun culture runs deep in this country.\\n\\nThis is what I grew up with, yes.  This is -- I shot my very first turkey with this gun at 12 years old, actually.  That\\'s a 22 rim fire cartridge.  And that is probably the type of firearm that most kids start off with.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These guys, I\\'m guessing, are not people I should be worried about.  They are nice.  And exceedingly patient with a city boy who wants to play with their guns.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That there is a 338 Winchester magnum.  That\\'s a big cartridge, heavy bullet kind of for very large game like elk.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s a target up on that hillside.  Can you see it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now watch Mr. New York City liberal shoot that target out there from 244 wind-swept yards.\\n\\nOh, wow.  Now am I accounting for windage dropping, and wind distance -- what?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, you want to aim 13 millimeters to the left, four millimeters high and you\\'ll hit dead-center.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Left?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, hold it right on.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nI\\'m just making a joke.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Taking advantage of the city boy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That wind\\'s got to be 20 miles an hour.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Holding the rifle in this wind without a brace is tough.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All eyes are on you, no pressure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pretty close, huh?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  He may have been a hair left.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A little high that time, I think.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A little right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Shooting real good, though, tony.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I mean, you\\'re not missing it by much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re real close.  You\\'d be hitting them. Exhale.  Squeeze.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The biggest thing is just let it surprise you.  As you\\'re pulling the trigger, squeeze it slow.  And every time it goes off, it should surprise you, that way you don\\'t flinch.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That looked right on.  That looked right on to me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I got to tell you, I\\'m proud of myself.  I was like, somewhere in the neighborhood.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He\\'s a natural.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think that, like, people who just don\\'t like the idea of guns, if they had a day out here shooting targets --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- I suspect a fair number of them would at least temper their views somewhat.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A thousand percent.  Absolutely.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you definitely get a respect for the power of it, for sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Generally speaking, me and these guys I think should feel free to buy all the guns we want.  It\\'s the rest of you I\\'m not so sure about.\\n\\nI know how to shoot beer cans.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIf the zombie apocalypse comes, I\\'ll be ready.  As long as they\\'re holding beers.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, when I grew up, when I was a kid, I played cowboys and Indians.  The cowboy myth had such a grip on Americans\\' self-identity.\\n\\nDAVID MANZANARES:  I remember.  Playing cowboys and Indians, it was just part of the culture.  You looked up to John Wayne, you know, Steve McQueen.  My kid, 12 years old, wouldn\\'t even think about cowboys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is David Manzanares.  His family has lived here for generations, tracing their roots all the way back to the Spanish conquistador.\\n\\nMANZANARES:  You know, those cliff walls out there, Tony, are 160 million years old.  And  the ones at the bottom, about 220.  They\\'re all the way back to the Triassic era.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this is Ghost Ranch, next door to David\\'s spread.  This is the area where Georgia O\\'Keefe spent the last and most productive decades of her life.\\n\\nMANZANARES:  Now you\\'ve walked through her painting.  This is what she called my country.  You know, it wasn\\'t until I was in my early 20s that I even knew who Georgia O\\'Keefe was.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMANZANARES:  Grew up with her was being like a grandmother.  It took me going into a L.A. and going into a gallery out there, I saw all these paintings.  Like an idiot, I said, why did you have pictures of my house?  And she said please, take a step back.  That\\'s Georgia O\\'Keefe\\'s.\\n\\nIt\\'s just going to get prettier.  It\\'s just going to get prettier.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One of O\\'Keefe\\'s biographers infamously described this landscape, which had so captivated the artist, as garish, vulgar, and in poor taste, which if you look around is pretty hard to comprehend.\\n\\nThis is such the other side of the universe for somebody who lives like I do.  Who live in cities, for whom a backyard this big is inconceivable.  The idea that there\\'s a certain type of personality who\\'s drawn towards open spaces like this.\\n\\nMANZANARES:  You know, this country, it either embraces you or within a year it spits you out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We reached the end of our trail at a place called Valley of Thieves, once said to be a haven for infamous cattle wrestlers, of course.\\n\\nThey call it the rabbit.  Ladies, you know what I\\'m talking about. Jesus, I\\'m in my 50s.  Everything sits still with -- find a distinguished segue into adulthood one of these days.\\n\\nThree generations of Manzanares are here with me this evening. Herman, David, and Max.  We\\'ll do our best to put together a little meal.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anybody want some coffee?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll take some of that.  Who am I kidding?  I\\'m a city boy. Yes.  Trying to get all Jack Palance here.  Come on.  Who am I kidding?\\n\\nWe\\'re also joined by Dan Flores, respected authority, professor of history, author of the book \"Horizontal Yellow: Nature and History in the Near Southwest.\"\\n\\nHow Spanish is New Mexico still?  I mean, how powerful are the echoes from Spain?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Spain was in control of New Mexico for far longer than Mexico was.  I think a lot of these New Mexican families are 10 generation and 11 generation.  When they look back on themselves, they think of themselves as Spanish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Those traditions, they\\'ve continued to thrive in these little pockets.  We\\'re cut off from Spain.  So I once worked with people from Spain and they kept cutting up, snickering at me. What they told me was OK, you can knock it off with the Don Quixote phraseology.\\n\\nThe equivalent of me today talking -- top of the morning to you, sir.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And they\\'re like stop making fun of us.  And I said you know what?  I\\'m not making fun of you.  That\\'s the way we speak.  You know, we go see grandpa, that\\'s all he knows is 500-year- ago Spanish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe if we\\'re lucky enough, we\\'ll have grandpa play his harmonica the way he used to on the cattle drives.  BOURDAIN:  But I have a plan here on this meat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right, the meat is yours.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right, good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just call me cooky.  Some good local beef, glowing hot coals, cast iron pan.\\n\\nWant to puree the green chilies here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful.  Yes.  I\\'m going to throw those chilies in, a little -- stew it for a few minutes, and it\\'d be good.  I just need a few splashes of like an open beer.  Beautiful.\\n\\nCheck it off the chuck wagon greatest hits, we\\'ve got some beans, some potatoes, some corn bread.  We do our best.\\n\\nThis is just about ready.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let\\'s eat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dig in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We done good, gentlemen.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No kidding.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you, tony.  This is excellent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m wondering, you guys have been here for so long, your family, could you live anywhere else?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not me.  No, not me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is home.  I always get called back here.  You know, I visited Paris and lived in L.A. for a while.\\n\\nAnd, you know, Paris is pretty great.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s pretty great.  It\\'s pretty great.  But it\\'s not here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dan, I\\'m curious to know why you chose -- why you came here initially?\\n\\nDAN:  Open space.  Because I had grown up in a circumstance where you couldn\\'t see 50 feet.  I mean, the forest was so dense.  I used to climb up into the top of the tree on the highest hill just to be able to see over the forest.  So it was something about the idea of being able to see the landscape that really compelled me so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The big empty makes a real deep, deep sense to a certain type of person.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since before 1598, when Santa Fe was established as a province of New Spain, grizzled frontiersmen and hearty pioneers have come to this unforgiving landscape to eke out a difficult existence.\\n\\nWelcome to Santa Fe today.  Where we can all live the Western dream and even buy a little piece of it to take home.  You got to love it. We pretty much eradicate the Native American culture, and now in newer, more politically correct times, we decide we love Indians and all things Native American.  And we\\'re kind of, but not really sorry. But how much is that (INAUDIBLE).  That\\'s not all.  The new West is inclusive.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Welcome to Santa Fe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve got a whole spectrum of new age crystal types seeking spiritual purity and intensity in the harsh, yet beautiful landscape.  It\\'s the last place in the U.S. you can wear buckskin and fringe without irony.  While holding a Buddhist blanket.\\n\\nThere is, very deep inside this ordinary-looking five and dime, something truly authentic.\\n\\nHi.  Frito pie and a soda, please?  This is the Frito pie.  As American as apple pie or the Manhattan project, and nearly as deadly. Canned Hormel chili and day-glow orange cheese-like substance dropped like a deuce, another roller in the night, right into a bag of Fritos.\\n\\nIt feels like you\\'re holding warm crap in a bag.  Close your eyes and I put this in your hand, you would be very worried.  (INAUDIBLE). Imposed everything this dish (INAUDIBLE), and yet, it is also delicious.  Neither the Frito nor the Frito pie are indigenous to New Mexico.  They were actually Texan.\\n\\nNew Mexico, you have many wonderful things.  Let Texas have this one. I managed to reach a depth of self-loathing that usually takes a night of drinking to achieve.  You find the Frito pie experience like you finished Tequila drinking and a strip club.\\n\\nA warm, spreading glow fills my belly as I set out once more in my mighty Ford Galaxy.  Yet I am also depressed.\\n\\nFrito pie.  I smell metaphor.  Speaking of explosive diarrhea -- did you know that the first ever atomic bomb was exploded in 1945 in the desert of New Mexico?  Sushi bars, galleries, wrecking massage studios.  Crystals?  We got them.\\n\\nI think I need to adjust my vent or something because I just see dark portents in all of this.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDAN FLORES:  Well, there are a lot of dark portents.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That today is Frito pie.  FLORES:  This food will lighten you up, I guarantee you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Horseman\\'s Haven Cafe sits next to a gas station that is about as far away from the plaza as you can get without leaving the Santa Fe city limits.\\n\\nFLORES:  It has a special feel of chilies grown specifically for this restaurant and nowhere else.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I meet back up with Dan Flores for a little historical perspective over some of Santa Fe\\'s most beloved New Mexican fare.\\n\\nFLORES:  I\\'ve known people who have journeyed 300 or 400 miles to come and eat at Horseman\\'s Haven.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Enchilada with carne.  Cubed pork in red New Mexican chili sauce with beans and rice.  Got to have that.  Some pasole, a stew made from soaked hominy and pork.  And sopapilla.  A fried bread like a spoon bread or a Johnny cake.\\n\\nDid the early Spaniards, early cattle, railroad men, and -- you know, the people on their way to making this America, were they romantic about this part of the world?\\n\\nFLORES:  They thought of it as a hard place.  For one thing, it was exceedingly remote.  When you were here, this seemed like one of the farthest reaches of the globe.  I mean, initially, Americans began coming here because they perceived that Santa Fe was so remote from the rest of the Spanish empire that it was possible for the United States to pluck it.  I don\\'t think anybody becomes a romantic about it probably until the Taos painters arrive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Starting a long-running tradition of artistic pilgrimages to catch the spiritual groove, every kind of utopian dreamer, eccentric, new ager, they all came here in search of whatever.  Mmm, chilies.\\n\\nAll right.  Thank you very much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Level three.\\n\\nFLORES:  That\\'s level three?  All right.  We will be careful indeed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  New Mexican chilies come in two varieties, red or green.\\n\\nFLORES:  That\\'s the, by the way, the state question in New Mexico.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Red or green?\\n\\nFLORES:  Red or green.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ordinarily, I like green.  It\\'s like Yankees or Mets. You\\'ve got to pick one.  This green, however, is not ordinary green.\\n\\nMy face is burning off.\\n\\nThis ain\\'t normal.  Oh, god.  This hurts.\\n\\nFLORES:  I\\'m going to join you.  Faith lies right here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Def-con one, two, three.  It\\'s a slow roll.  First you think it\\'s going to be OK.  Then it\\'s not.  There\\'s nothing you can do but wait it out.  I believe they use the same peppers in pepper spray.\\n\\nFLORES:  Or repelling grizzly bears if that tells you anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  A shot glass of that will put you in the hospital.\\n\\nFLORES:  No kidding.  Everybody in the restaurant seems so calm. Maybe they\\'re not eating this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re all just trying to muffle their screams.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  History, they say, belongs to the victors.  And here, where the myth of the American West took root, where so much romantic lore began, history was being rewritten almost as soon as it happened. This was never the big empty.  As Dan Flores writes the idea of a wilderness is itself a cultural construct.\\n\\nAs early as 1539 when Marcos De Niza, a Franciscan friar, reported sighting from a distance what he called the seven cities of Cibola, these were interpreted as tantalizing outposts of wealth, possible cities of gold.  Coronado, the famous Spanish conquistador, quickly dispatched an expedition and there were indeed cities.\\n\\nThank you for having us.\\n\\nThe home of community leader Ivan Pino in Zia Pueblo.  I\\'m here to join him and his nephew Robert and family in a traditional hunt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we\\'ll be carrying our shotguns.  We\\'ll be carrying our rabbit stick.  Do this in a bar, you know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s harder.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s always good to get a prayer going so that the animals can be willing to take their life.  (Speaking in Foreign Language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Pueblo who lived here continuously since around 1250 A.D. had long before the Spanish or anyone else arrived a highly organized society.  They built multi-level adobe apartment blocks. They farmed the land.  Irrigated crops using intricate water diversion systems.  All this in what sure as hell looked like a harsh and unforgiving land.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is good weather, though, for hunting because it\\'s a nice breeze, overcast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  The breeze is beautiful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not too hot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pueblo long ago learned to adapt to hard times, dry seasons, war, incursion.  There were years where there was nothing. And they had to deal.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We found a pack rat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our first pack rat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In preparation for the summer solstice ceremony, game like rabbits and pack rats are collected for the medicine man as a payment for his services.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How you notice is there\\'s some droppings, fresh droppings.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see the droppings, you know there\\'s one around.  At this time of the day, they\\'re going to be inside their homes.  There\\'s too many predators around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s not easy.  Once you find a nest, you got to dig after the little burrowing bastards.  You hack, you dig.  You dig some more.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A lot of work for a small rodent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was just thinking that.  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what our ancestors had to do sometimes. You know, when times got hard.  Right now there\\'s this drought going on.  And if we didn\\'t have the grocery stores --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nThen hopefully you flush one cleanly --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Got it right here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And give him a good whack on the head.\\n\\nThe ratio of work to protein is not a hunter\\'s favor.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s whiskers.  A little bit of his tail.  And plant it back in here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To ensure regeneration of this once vital source of food, tradition and ritual requires returning a part of the animal back to the nest.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I will never go hungry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Going for pack rats is really an homage, an acknowledgement of an important earlier time when that was all there was.  The 25-year great drought.\\n\\nAs a city boy, I am greatly relieved these little critters are for the medicine man and that we won\\'t actually be eating any of them. Instead, Linda, Ivan\\'s wife, is preparing a pretty traditional menu.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nothing is wasted when our game is brought home. You know, we dry up and dehydrate the bone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Deer bone stew, red chili stew cooked with dried elk and potatoes, pinto beans with chicos, that\\'s roasted dried corn, and tortillas.  And of course, more chilies.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We call this, this dish, pusharound chili because you gather and push around.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Push around until you see the one you want.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The chilies in this state are magical.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE).  And the seeds have been passed on from generation to generation.  They stay within the families.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What percentage of young people leave and don\\'t come back?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not too many people will leave.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  There are people who leave, but eventually there\\'s this yearning inside you that you want to go home, you want to learn your culture, you want to be a part of everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It would be an understatement to say that the first Europeans who came into contact with Indians was destructive to the culture.  And given that history, how American do you feel?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This village is unique in that we can easily just, you know, ignore everything that happens out there and just keep to ourselves here, and we do that sometimes.  We close the road and we take care of our own business here.  But it really varies by individual.  And maybe even by generation.  We have a veteran, a veteran, a veteran that all served in our armed forces.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A big tradition of serving in the military.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We continue to be outdoorsmen.  And we are survivors.  I\\'ve dealt with the elements of the dust, the rain, the hail.  But it made a better person out of me.  We are who we are. We\\'re still going to be here.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN:  Look up in the dark.  The night sky.  Uncontaminated by the light of any nearby cities, you can see things.  And of course, you\\'ve got a rich tradition of actual, real-life spooky science fiction stuff.  The Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, nuclear missile silos hidden deep beneath the desert floor.  It\\'s out there.\\n\\nSo where are we?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ground zero of where everything seems to have started.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Submitted for your approval.  Norio and his friend James, two men associated with the New Mexico UFO and paranormal forum.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is where America\\'s rocketry actually started.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At the end of World War II, classified units of the CIA and army intelligence were busy sandbagging and sneaking away from probable prosecution, cadres of the world\\'s best rocket scientists. Did I mention they were Nazis?  Oh yes, many of them were sent around here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Other very mysterious things even took place, allegedly, in 1947.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  1947, Roswell incident.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s right.  That\\'s still a mystery.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Some say.  You notice how they always say that in those dubious cheaply reenacted doc shows.  Some say it was the remains of an alien space craft.  Any who, back then they were working on some pretty cool stuff.  For instance, a Mylar-like weather balloon designed to carry high-resolution cameras across the Soviet Union.\\n\\nWhen they got way up in the atmosphere they pancake out like a flying saucer.\\n\\nMight that explain the excessive zeal and mysterious behaviors?  I mean, if one of these things crashed in the desert, you can well understand that a whole bunch of sinister-looking bodies would show up and start telling people never speak of this incident and --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, it\\'s hard to say, but any military could create a cover story for anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any possibility of like, cyborgs or aliens?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, you know, I\\'ve heard that there is and then I\\'ve heard there isn\\'t.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re taking you to a place, an undisclosed location.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What\\'s known as Albuquerque\\'s own Area 51.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There will be no probing involved.  You know, because every time there\\'s, like, alien stuff, there\\'s always probing.  Always with the probing.  I don\\'t understand.  It\\'s like, if they\\'ve been coming here for years, haven\\'t they done enough probing?\\n\\nWell, if you were like on ghost adventures, you\\'d be really playing this up.\\n\\nSome say this area was used for sinister experiments, German-speaking cyborgs.  We need to find some crack pot science.  This is even better than Area 51.  This is like Area 61.\\n\\nArea 61 turns out to be a fenced off view of essentially Kirkland Air Force Base.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The leading edge of military research development and testing.  At night, there\\'s a lot of lights.  It\\'s a huge complex.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fact is, there was and still is some pretty cool stuff being tested out there in the desert.  Maybe for DARPA or NSA or the Air Force.  Who knows?\\n\\nDo you think there are -- do you think there are other life forms among us who visited this planet?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who do you think?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, personally, I have a different opinion. This whole alien concept is a cover story in order to conceal certain kinds of projects, but I could be wrong.  But I try to be a realist but I\\'m open to anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is for certain and has been authentically documented on film is that somewhere out there among the silos, underground cities, supposed nuclear waste dumps and alien burial grounds, there is a large animal and a hole in the ground.\\n\\nWhat strange beast even now is being loaded into a grave size pit in the desert for me?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, since the beginning of civilization, I think one of the first things we -- any society learned to do is dig a hole, throw an animal in it, you know, cook it.\\n\\nThey call it around here a matanza.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One, two, three, up, up, up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s pretty much an old-school version of a barbecue in the sense that it involves burying a giant pig and the imbibing of much alcohol.  About 20 minutes from the nearest paved road is a place called Dead Horse Ranch.  People who help us make the show, their families, friends and no shortage of local New Mexican characters have gathered to partake in the festivities.\\n\\nThere is beer here.  Plenty of it, local and delicious.  And abundant. Did I say that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tony, need a drink?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are very tasty and lethal as it turns out margaritas and I believe to the best of my recollection anyway that I soon made the classic error of moving from margaritas to actual shots of straight tequila.  It does make it easier to meet new people.\\n\\nLet me ask you.  Why is it that any time an alien visits like America, there\\'s always anal penetration involved?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I never heard it before.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ever.  No.  Am I into that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But the pig, the pig.  What about that body in the desert? Some say the tradition of the matanza dates back to Moorish times, when the eating of pig had to be clandestine.  But a bit of history you can verify this pig has been cooked slow over hot coals for the last 17 hours.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I kind of peak on its ass.  It looks delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Frank here, he knows.  He runs Poncho\\'s Barbecue in Albuquerque.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just start sticking to a part of this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Time to get slicing.  I step in to help Frank break my piggy friend down into his constituent parts.\\n\\nBeautiful.\\n\\nFirst off go the legs, what you call your fresh ham.  Then your four quarter, your shoulders and whatnot.  The loin and rib section, your pork belly.  Nothing goes to waste.  All those pig parts sent down the line to Harold who\\'s been using them for a veritable rainbow of New Mexico specialties.\\n\\nNone of our 300-pound friend will go to waste.  He\\'s gotten shredded for tacos, added to the beans, cooked up with pasole, going into chili.  Red or green.\\n\\nOh, yes, that\\'s going to be beautiful.\\n\\nThe tenderloin I set aside for a little time on the grill.  Everyone here has put in a lot of work.  And they\\'re hungry.  Time to eat.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know the show was about this but I\\'ve been thinking about it a lot.  This sort of cowboys, Mexicans, Indian, romantic idea.  A lot of easterners came out and fell in love with this romantic notion of the West and wanted to come out here and sort of kind of create their own version of the West.  Was that a good thing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what helps us as a people, as a native culture.  As a culture that\\'s been here for these years.  We invite you to come and enjoy what we partake in.  I mean the Indians have the beans and the chili and the corn.  The Spanish people brought the pork.  I mean, and we put that together and we have this meal here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People love the native culture, they love the Hispanic culture here.  It wasn\\'t always that way when I was younger.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You played cowboys and Indians as a kid.  If there is one American iconic hero it\\'s the lone cowboy.  Does that have any resonance at all out here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Every culture here, Mexican, Spanish, Pueblo, Reservation, white, we all are cowboys here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am a native New Mexican.  I have gone through strange phases of, like, my ownership of this place.  It\\'s this weird mixed bag of everything here, all the time.  And that\\'s -- that is the identity.  I don\\'t know.  It allows a certain freedom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My desire to wear cowboy boots and put a hat on right now, you\\'re sympathetic to that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, I\\'m from New Mexico, and yes, I would like also like to put my purse word kicking boots and a hat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Its very kind of you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tony, I got a question for you.  What do you think of New Mexico?  Kind of what are your thoughts?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I want try to boil it down to a simple statement.  If you\\'re an Easterner and you come out to New Mexico you start to see metaphors in everything but actually if you were to stretch a little bit you could say that New Mexico is a perfect metaphor for America.\\n\\nIt is a total mutation.  It\\'s got Spanish, Mexican, original American and add a tinge of radioactivity.  This is what America really is. We\\'re an immigrant culture, we are a gun culture.\\n\\nThe expression of American power and identity has always been the lone cowboy with a gun.  That goes deep.  This is the heart of the American dream, love it or hate it, this is it.\\n\\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Good evening, I\\'m Anderson Cooper.\\n\\nIt\\'s been more than four years since Michael Jackson\\'s death.  Four years since Katherine Jackson lost her son and his children lost their father.  And the question still remains, who\\'s responsible for the death of Michael Jackson?

       " \"\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST: In Bahia, you find yourself in the heart of the heart of Brazil, where the magic comes from. If you want to get there, just follow the sound of the drums. This is Salvador De Bahia, city of three million people. First capital of Brazil. The wellspring for everything African and spicy, where things seem to just sway and move constantly. It's a place where everybody is sexy, where even the ugly people are hot. Unsurprisingly, this is where artists come from. African spiritualism, cult magic, Candomble, Capoeira. And caipirinhas, did I mention caipirinhas? They do those here, too. I like them. I like them a lot.\\n\\nWhat's magical about this cocktail is the first taste, it's like I don't know, man, it's a little too something. Then like that second sip, it's like oh, that's kind of good. Then the third sip, it's where are my pants. Fortunately, food in these parts tends to be, shall we say, hearty. For instance, a delightful meal of fried meat with plenty of absorbent starch product like baropha(ph), the perfect accompaniment to many, many caipirinhas.\\n\\nOh, excellent. Now we're talking. It's a tough town for vegetarians. Oh, good. I'll have six more of these, please. People are staring at me, they looked at me. Even hump of American, how much he's eating. Line them up, my friend. Oh, yeah. So, nice walking around here. The party and the components are really amazing. There's always drums somewhere.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to Salvador my friend.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good to be here, again.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yeah?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Love it here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please. One cup for you, men. Welcome to Salvador.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What a good seat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This is Claudio and Maurelia. It's good to have friends in a place like Salvador. In fact, you're pretty much lost without them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE. BOURDAIN: Tuesday night in (inaudible).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, man. And then Tuesday nights are very impressive. Many people come to church first, next they go drinking around. Try something, listen to go amused(ph) and you call it here, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You have to work tomorrow, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I guess that's Brazil, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, Brazil, but you have this kind of behavior here, not in whole city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So, how different is Salvador from Rio and Sao Paulo?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Men, Salvador is a modern, you know, (inaudible). This is amazing area.\\n\\nBOIRDAIN: It is.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's amazing. Eat, drink, history, memory, anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Pelourinho, Pelo for short, was Salvador during the Portuguese colonial period. It's almost always a party, a series of parties, actually, but tonight is special.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at this, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Smells good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, that's good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn't that good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Where to next?\\n\\n(INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like to bring you here today because coming here, people everywhere, it's free party. You can dance, you can drink in here everywhere. It's amazing. Do you want to try that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What is it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's Caramio, mix of honey and lemon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Alcohol?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. BOURDAIN: Alcohol of unknown original in dispensed from atop the head\\n\\nof a stranger? It's good. Mama always said that was a good idea. I don't know if it's the booze or the music or the tropical heat, but after awhile bouncing from place to place, wandering down old cobblestone streets, different music issuing from everywhere, a different party, people flowing out of buildings, one gathering, commingling with another, the music mixing, it really does seem that everybody is moving to some mysterious unknowable pulse, some unheard throb that moves people to constantly touch each other, stroke hips, necks, limbs. It is useful to know that of over 12 million Africans dragged, ripped and kidnapped from their homelands, nearly five million ended up in Brazil. 1.5 million of them in Bahia alone.\\n\\nPelourinho became the locus of a vast infrastructure of plantations and the slave trade that powered them. Making this city in Northeastern Brazil the most opulent in the new world. Pelourinho, it's worth pointing out, gets its name from the whipping post. A hundred years after slavery was outlawed in Brazil, Pelourinho had been forgotten. But of course, the neighborhood had its charms. If you were an artist, a musician, a writer, you could afford to live here. Cheap rent for long-time locals or shiny new art galleries at hipster cafes, we know which way the current of history runs.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Here, though, one man stands alone. Jayme Figura a poet, sculptor, painter, musician, now perhaps his own greatest artistic creation. He's chosen to hide his face from view and to stand in opposition, an eyesore, a rebuke, a defiant war-like embarrassment to the occupiers. As he dresses now, this is for protection but as I understand, also protest.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nJAYME FIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a kind of protest but also protection. You know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Who's the enemy?\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everyone. You see face, you see heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How long have you been wearing the armor? How long?\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: 46 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: 46 years. That was a long time ago. You ever been on the beach?\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, sir. Only shadow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Are you Goth, dude.\\n\\nFIGURA: Whiskey.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whiskey and coco. It's about not sun. No sun.\\n\\nFIGURA:(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not water, not sun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Just down from where we're sitting, Gymez(ph) Pelourinho studio. His water and power have been shut off but he insists he's going nowhere. Brazil is supposed to be about what, music, dancing, sun, hot women. Does he reject those things? Does he think that's bull?\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am the wrong country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Where would the perfect place be?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Rock city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Rock city. That's Detroit.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Detroit.\\n\\nFIGURA: Detroit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Detroit, rock city. What music inspires him?\\n\\nFIGURA: Iron maiden.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Iron maiden. I think they're touring, actually.\\n\\nFIGURA: Nirvana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Metallica?\\n\\nFIGURA: Beethoven.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Beethoven.\\n\\nFIGURA: Metallica, Beethoven.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What do you think about all of this? Anybody who comes here recognizes immediately that this is a really uniquely extraordinary and despite many problems, a uniquely wonderful, magical place.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a magical place but also for us, for me and for him, here is a place where many people have, black has suffered. That is still one kind of karma of this old history here, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So, what is the real Pelourinho? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREING LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREING LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nFIGURA: (SPEAKING FOREING LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I don't like Pina Coladas but I like walking in the rain. I like wandering through markets as much as the next guy, but what I really like are neurotoxins. In Japan, they call it Fugu. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's eyes, ovaries and internal organs are just packed with varying amounts of toxins and some hysterical mini's(ph) will tell you the tetrodotoxin present in the blowfish is 1200 times more potent than cyanide and they'll tell you how if it's consumed, you remain conscious while your muscles gradually become paralyzed and death, like a slow-moving freight train, moves closer and closer. And whatever you do, just make sure you cut out that liver. I say bull. So, we're eating blowfish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. It's an adventure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Like the Japanese, they like the poisons?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know, I know, I know, yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: But they remove the liver and the skin?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's supposed to be removed properly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. Properly, right. I saw a Simpsons episode, I think.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This guy makes it great.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Poisonous blowfish will take a recipe. Add to said fish, lemon, coriander, onion, tomato, coconut milk, dende oil, cover and simmer. I am confident in this cook I don't know. And in this man, Bel Borba(ph) my host and an aficionado of this dish. Smelling good.\\n\\nBEL BORBA, ARTIST: Bon appetite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a lot of pepper, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah. Good pepper. Nice and spicy. I can't feel my legs. Is that a bad thing? Bel is an artist, after all. A very famous one. So, he knows about neurotoxins. He comes from a long tradition of artists who have found inspiration in Bahia. Is there something about Salvador you think that's conducive to an artistic sensibility? There is so much color here and music.\\n\\nBORBA: The light here is beautiful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The light is really special. I mean, just the colors of the city are amazing. The colors of the people are amazing, and the way they move.\\n\\nBORBA: They move.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I don't know, when I first came here, I thought everybody in this city looks like they just got or they're on their way to go.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So, this was the central market back before supermarkets, this is where everybody did their shopping, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes. You know what, this is the real Brazil here. The real Bahia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This place is fantastic of the city. They sell shrimps and stuff, oil and stuff, this kind of oil, they called dende, palm oil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: However you want to call it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And I love the dende oil. You know, it takes some getting used to. The first time I was here, you know, you eat it, you ship like a mink for hours afterwards. But now, no problems. I've been eating this all week. Love it. You spend time in Brazil...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You develop resistance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: There you go buddy. Hope you like spicy. He's a Brazilian cat. He's got to like spicy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A little cachuchas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Told you. That will set you right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that will protect you from the poison.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. We're coming up to the world cup and I know a lot of people will be reading about crime and all that. How do you think it's gonna go, the world cup? Disaster or it's going to somehow work out?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it will be a success.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You think it will be a success.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sure of it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Salvador is one of the host cities for the 2014 world cup. A huge stadium has recently been completed, but a lot of people are worried, concerned, if Brazil is ready. I've been told thousands of prostitutes are studying tourist-appropriate languages in preparation, so probably a lot of people are gonna get laid, a lot of people are gonna get robbed, a lot of people are gonna get laid and robbed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you ever been here in carnival?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The world cup is that carnival.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And that works out, right? That's not a slaughter fest.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Things happen but it works.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I think Salvador in particular is a place where...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: May I?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, buddy, thank you. No matter what, people should come. Even people who are afraid to travel, who say oh, well, but I hear. No, you know what, this is, live your life, man. You should not miss a place like this, because there aren't a lot of places in the world that even come close to this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at we're today, I invited you to have this dish. We are not going to die. Because...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because we're not going to die.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I'm pretty sure Mr. Muffin stuff over here is gonna suddenly going to jump on, he start clawing my face.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the poison was active, she's dead.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I didn't think of that. We call you canary.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are not born for dying.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BOURDAIN: The bay of all saints, a vast natural harbor allowed Salvador to prosper. Tucked along its shore, if you look hard enough, you'll find a small grouping of shacks roofed in corrugated tin. This is where a local fishermen's association brings their catch to sell to wholesalers, and then relax after a long day on the water. Catch of the day, the prized big red snapper. Rub with sea salt, lemon, olive oil, grill over charcoal. Enjoy view. So, everybody here is fishermen?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Meet, Maloca, a very special guy. He's been working as our head of security and as for reasons that are immediately obvious, he enjoys respect and reputation on the streets. But he also comes out of this neighborhood and these guys are his friends. How's business now? I mean, lot of fish out there? Fishing business good?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Lunch wouldn't be complete without a delicious spicy salsa of garlic, tomato, onions and peppers. On the side, some deep fried little smelts. Don't forget the beer and the Cachaca and enjoy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah. That will work. Looks like a big grouper.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a big redfish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have to advise you that it's spicy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It's spicy. What do they drink, beer or Cachaca?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Both.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Still working?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He work more than all of us.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They use a line or net?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A line.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My secret is just the hand around a piece of wood like that and take like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They don't cut the hands?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Always cut the hands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Fishing anywhere is hard and the way these guys do it, particularly hard. Mostly hand lines from small boats. Just look at these hands. OK.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You're a hard man. Literally.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, that's what I want, right here. Oh, yeah. Jackpot. That's -- you'll pardon the expression, some good head.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fisherman loves the head.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It's awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the best part for them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Looking good. Take him to slow him right on the (inaudible). Good piece of fish. Beautiful.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: In Rio, if you're anything less than perfectly cut, you feel terrible going to the beach. You never want to go to the beach. Here, you can frolic in a Speedo and feel pretty good about myself. Let it all hang out here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Caipirinha?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caipirinha.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah, the Caipirinha man. This indispensable icon of Brazilian beach culture is known to start with fresh lime, muddle and mash with more lime juice, sugar, ice, the magic ingredient, Cachaca. That's basically the distilled liquor of the sugar cane. Shaken, not stirred, and you've got yourself one of the world's truly great cocktails, the utility beverage good for any time of day or any social occasion. Very satisfying. (Inaudible) toasted cheese things here, awesome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: If there's anything better than cheese, it's semi-melted cheese. And what's the best part of French onion soup? It's the little burned bits of cheese around the edge. Oh, yeah. Just as good as it looks. Look at this line. These guys are famous. Acaraje, I've had it before. I have had it here, in fact. These ladies make it good. Really good. The clothes go back to the newly freed slaves who now were able to practice their religion and began selling the Acaraje to support the (inaudible) community. What is Acaraje? Behold. A paste, a batter, a falafel like wad or smooched up black-eyed peas, seasoned with brown brine (ph) shrimp and onions, deep fried to crispy and golden with some chili spike in dende oil. Already if you're a rookie, you're guaranteed some quality time on the porcelain bus real soon. On the top, you got you're (inaudible) which is sort of a shrimp curry paste. And your tomato salad, your fried shrimp, Camarao frito, a must. All right. Beautiful. Don't forget the hot chili oil and prepare for lift- off. Really good.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: When millions of Africans were taken by force to Brazil, the traditions, the musical roots they had, instruments they played, their gods and their food came with them. In the days of slavery, you would hide that stuff, whether it was your religion or your self-defense skills. So, tell me about capoeira.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was a kind of martial art but in the beginning of the 19th century, capoeira became more like a game and the music instruments were associated to the finest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No hats, right? Both feet and head (ph)? Why no hands?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We use the hands in just a few movements.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Where did that come from and why do you think that became...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some people say that this is inspired by the animal movements.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: In a recent study observing the comparative destructive power between kicks from various martial arts, of karate, muay thai and taekwondo, it was Capoeira that packed the most ferocious impact. The colonial masters knew this and made it illegal for much of Brazil's history. Today, maestros like Chanja (ph) and (inaudible) teach capoeira in classrooms and on stages. Originally it was a male- dominated activity. When did that change? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Since the '60s. Masters (inaudible) -- we start\\n\\nour process in the beginning of the '80s and nowadays, we have hundreds of women practice capoeira.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What was it like in the beginning, the very first women who did it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mothers or fathers or the family...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, sad that capoeira is not for women, why do you decide to do this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Afro Brazilian cuisine is the result of many, many years of cooks experimenting with African and Portuguese dishes combined with local ingredients like seafood, chillies, coconut milk. This is Angelica's house. Open one day a week as a restaurant serving her unique style of Bahian dishes. Beautiful. Wow. Look at that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Looks very good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How has being a master of capoeira, how has that changed the rest of your life?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think changed it a lot. Women in general, they don't learn to fight. Learning how to be involved in real fights, game and fight at the same time, we became more prepared to be involved in symbolic fight and in our society, the women -- they are not so well prepared like men.\\n\\nCROWD: (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It was purely African in the beginning, and now it's Afro- Brazilian form, is that correct?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All the instruments are African instruments.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. They're singing. A lot of singing, and it's important.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. Yeah. And in Portuguese -- that we in our group, and in a Capoeira, we start to include music from multi- cultural African cultural traditions including lyrics in African language.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All the things that we look at as Brazilian from outside looking in, the cuisine, samba, all of these things are very African in origin. This is kind of where that all started, yes? I mean, I don't want to say it's the real Brazil. Everyone looks at Rio as the postcard Brazil, but here it's really -- you feel it, those things. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It has to do with this big concentration of\\n\\nAfricans since the beginning. It's different.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: If you, say, found yourself in Brazil and had a chance to hire a boat, head for the beach with a bunch of new friends, bring along a skilled mixologist, expertly trained in the fine arts of caipirinha making, why wouldn't you? Charge across the water, headed for a nice, quiet island, order up some sun to come out from behind dark clouds right about now. Sometimes cliches are cliches for a reason. Because they're good ideas to start with, which is why people keep looking for them and doing them over and over. In a perfect world upon reaching said enchanted island, you jump into the warm Atlantic waters, and if you could, you would have a classic soundtrack to this adventure, like samba, for instance. Splash around for a while, maybe enjoy a nice cold beer or two. You truly have not taken a beach until a man has set up the caipirinha station. Then you know the LZ is secure.\\n\\nI love nature and caipirinha. Oh what's going on here? Caipirinha. Please. Sweet. This alone is an argument for the greatness of this country. And what goes great with caipirinha is on the beach? How about some barbecue? (Inaudible) would show here by the way. Someone take it. Please, (inaudible) don't eat me. Look in your heart. Don't eat me. Oh, no. Not my head. To complete the picture, make a large fish. Maybe some crab.\\n\\nYou know, anytime you get your Chinese, your Brazilians and your Italians all agreeing on something, it's pretty clear it's a really good idea. Everybody agrees that this complicated looking creature with all those troublesome shells is worth the work. So, you tear off the little limbs. We'll get to you a little later, my friends. Rip out the tail. These are the lungs you don't want them. Now, you've got all this nice fat in there. Oh, yeah. Now, we're getting to the claw. Look at that. Let's poke him out of there. Oh, yeah. This should do that that little melon of goodness. Like a celestial nibble.\\n\\nWhen people started demanding boneless stuff like chicken without a bone or crab meat without the actual crab, or lazy lobster, that was the beginning of the erosion of our society as we know it. If you're not willing to work for a payoff like this, how do you expect us to, like, fight al Qaeda if you can't suck the meat out of a crab? Character builder, and delicious. And if your perfect day really did happen, you would probably let yourself be swept away. By liquor and good food and gin clear water, all around you, horny Brazilians, casually fondle each other, get all dozy and fall asleep.\\n\\n\",\n",

One of the oldest, most complex, magically surreal places in Spain.  And one of the most beautiful.\\n\\nGranada is tucked against the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Andalucia in southern Spain.  It's not like Barcelona.  It's not like San Sebastian.  It ain't Madrid.  Any reasonable, sentient person who looks at Spain, comes to Spain, eats in Spain, drinks in Spain, they're going to fall in love.  Otherwise, there's something deeply wrong with you.\\n\\nSpain is the sort of place that never really made any sense anyway. But in the very best possible way.  This is the country that gave us the Spanish inquisition.  Also anarchy.  This is where devout Catholicism mixes with surrealism, modernist cuisine with traditional tapas.  Christianity and Islam traded places, shared space.  And the effects and influences of all those things are right here to see.\\n\\nYou can almost look back through time and through the mists of history see the Phoenicians marching up across the Vega, or are those feral hippies?\\n\\nAn influx of international hippies, many of whom appeared to have set up squats in the caves up the mountain and made things interesting.\\n\\nThey asked me if we're doing this they would stage in a moon landing.\\n\\nWherever you are on the ideological spectrum, however, some things are constant, it seems.  Some stereotypical expectations.  It's true, there are free tapas everywhere.  Yes, they do actually take siestas which is a civilized damn thing to do far as I can see.\\n\\nFlamenco, yes.  They do that also.  But in Granada, they do it old school.  And oh yes, bullfighting.  They do that here, too.\\n\\nBut I digress.  I'm here actually to answer a question.  What happens if you go over to the other side?  Say you grew up in the states and like a lot of us wondered, fantasized about what it would be like living abroad in old Europe, surrounded by crusader castles, delicious food, another language, another culture?  What would that alternate life, that road not taken be like?\\n\\nMy longtime friend and cameraman from Maine Zach Zamboni is finding out.\\n\\nSo where are we going?\\n\\nZACH ZAMBONI, FRIEND:  Right here, one of these tables, which maybe we want to do like this with.  See?  How often you get to out with somebody that can appropriately block the table?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Misery is what it is.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Boy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, of course.\\n\\nSnails in an almond sauce.  About as traditional and as  delicious as it gets.\\n\\nThat's a plate full of perfect (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Good tapa, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's right.  Tapas come from here.  And this is still one of the few places in Spain where they're free.  All you have to do is keep drinking.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  You can sit here all day.  Just order a couple of drinks and --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  No rush.  I'm glad I'm spending some time here.\\n\\nRed wine ordered.  Tripes to follow.  Tender, spicy, delicious tripe.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Sun.  Plaza.  Guts.  It's pretty good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hello.  Hello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not too long ago, before Zack basically defected to Spain, he met Fuen.  The next thing you know, he's living here.  Part of an extended Andalucian family.  Eat in the hand, drink in the wine, living the life of the Spanish dandy.  In freaking Granada, no less.\\n\\nClassically, culturally speaking, do you want a sensitive, nice, caring thoughtful guy?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, it depends on the woman, first.  But usually we look for this kind of person that we know he will protect us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  From what?  Feral hippies?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's very simple.  You know, or --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I would love to do the vows of your wedding.  Do you, Zach Zambodin.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Swear to protect Fuen Sanchez from any attacks by feral cave-dwelling hippies?  Who might attempt her to sell her jewelry or other things of little value.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Zach is a pretty cool (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I figure now that Zach is marrying into a Spanish family, I can piggyback along, for this.  Suck up the lure of the magic, live a little bit of what has often been my dream, too.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  But if we can get weird for a second here, man.  Some places, do they have an energy, man, about them?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are you saying now?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  You know, I don't want to get into metaphysics or, you know, some places we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You're going to be living up in a cave if you keep talking like this.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMore wine.\\n\\nTo see Spain, to see it straight, to understand it at all, you should probably peek, if only through spread fingers, at that most Spanish of traditions.  Bullfighting.\\n\\nMeet El Fandi, one of Spain's most dashing and respected bullfighters. He's invited me to La Marquesas Ranch, a private bull ring where he likes to practice.\\n\\nALEJANDRO, FRIEND:  So what you're going to do now is they're going to check brave --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And if the calf is not brave, stew.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Along with me for the day, Fuen's brother Alejandro, who, like many Spaniards, consider bullfighting an art.  Today a little practice first.  And don't worry, this guy is too young to fight.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  You see the red cape, you know this is the most thing. Where they make all the art, all the poetry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why the cape and not the man?  ALEJANDRO:  Because it's moving.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So that's important?\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  That's important.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You don't want to be moving --\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  You don't want to be moving at all.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIt seems the --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This guy clearly has spirit.  Right away he tries to take a poke at Zach's femoral artery.  Promising.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don't think so.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Sure.  You are him.  He's going to teach you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes?\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nNo one likes to look like a pussy on TV, so when El Fandi jokingly suggest I join him in the ring to wave a pink cape at an aggressive young bull, who just moments ago charged my cameraman, I said what any idiot would say -- si.\\n\\nIt all starts well enough.  Hey, this is fun.  This is easy.  Until I get a horn hooked right up next to my nutsack.  Then it's not so fun.\\n\\nThanks, guys.\\n\\nThis youngster shall live, perhaps to gore a future TV host with his mighty horns.\\n\\nNow this, this is what a real bull looks like.  This is a whole different thing.  Five hundred freaking kilos of aggressive charging four-legged killdozer aiming at your meat and two legs.\\n\\nIt's a lot of muscle.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Yes, it's a lot of muscle.  That's a big bull.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No matter how big, how strong, how scary, for this intrepid reporter who's seen many animals die for his dinner, this part is never easy.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  So as you see, he puts the cape lower.  So when the bull brings the face forward, showing the neck -- that's it.  That was very good.  And -- yes, that's it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hey, it's time for stew.  Bull stew.  Our friend went to a better place after all.  Like a big pot where he's simmers slowly for hours with local herbs, onions and potatoes.  Nothing like a roaring fire in a spread of Garico ham, homemade chorizo, Spanish cheeses, bread, and good olive oil to take the sting out of a near genital mutilation.\\n\\nNice.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Look good, huh?  It's not a bad place to come, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNow he started at age 19?\\n\\nEL FANDI, SPANISH BULLFIGHTER:  When I was a little kid, I always practiced with bulls.  But my first public fight, I was 14.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When you were a little boy growing up, you aspired to be a matador.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Yes.  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The matadors were the original rock stars, the very ideal of masculinity, male beauty, and grace.  That runs deep.  Like it or not, you should probably know this before dating a Spanish guy.\\n\\nMe, I'll happily see it into it tomorrow.  But there is no denying the terrible beauty of a very complex tradition.\\n\\nIt's not about winning.  It's not about killing the bull.  And nor is it about being just skillful.  You have to look good doing it, too.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there really like really ugly ass bullfighters?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBut a really out of shape -- I'm not (INAUDIBLE) with a muffin top. How do you call a muffin top?\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  I think there's a little -- yes, there's a little bit of everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Interesting.  Well, it was an education today, and a great meal.  Thank you.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN:  Holy Week or Semana Santa as it's called.  Observed all over southern Spain with a seriousness and a fervor you might not see elsewhere.  For seven days leading up to Easter, nearly every city in Andalucia gets taken over by ancient processions.  To an outsider, it's an impenetrable montage of confusing, yet deeply evocative images.\\n\\nFigures in dark hoods loom up from every direction.  Smoke pots of incense, candles, religious imagery, and the crowds.  Flashes of Goya (INAUDIBLE), dimly remembered impressions of the inquisition.\\n\\nOK, watch this.  These guys got to get their painstakingly crafted, massively sized and incredibly heavy and cumbersome float through the door, down the steps, and out into the street.\\n\\nPEDRO, FRIEND:  But the women who escort the Virgin, they wear candles to light the whole way to the cathedral.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pedro is another of Fuen's brothers, the youngest, and when not working for an I.T. company in Ireland, he does this.  He carries crushingly heavy religious floats.  They're calleed casteleros.  And they devout months of training to this.\\n\\nThat thing is huge.\\n\\nPEDRO:  Yes, they're moving.  It's huge.  And this is very, very heavy.  Very heavy throne.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Virgin float, about 3,500 pounds total, and precise dimensions that have to make it through the door just so.  The bearers have to kneel.  Crawl along with it on their backs to get it through the door.  And the main event.  Ready, set, up.\\n\\nLet's face it.  I like a procession and all, but who likes a bunch of guys in hoods coming in your general direction?  I don't.  Frankly, it freaks me out.  Time for a drink, perhaps.\\n\\nThis is Tabernacle.  As best I understand it an eastern Jesus and Mary-themed drinking establishment, where between drinks one can ponder the agony of Christ, but with sausages.\\n\\nIs it like this all year or just over Easter?\\n\\nPEDRO:  The whole year.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whole year.  It's always like this.\\n\\nPEDRO:  Whole year.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nPEDRO:  You have incense all year.  Eastern music all year.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now is this a week for quiet contemplation and worship or is this a party week or both?\\n\\nPEDRO:  Both of them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Throughout the course of the week, over 40-odd processions will creep slowly through these streets.  There are different brotherhoods, each with their own sacred colors, crests, insignia and so on.  It's their medallions of particular Christ images that adorn the bar.  And frankly, they're kind of bumming me out.\\n\\nMaybe it's just me, but when I'm getting a nice late morning buzz, I don't particularly want Jesus looking down at me from, like, everywhere.\\n\\nHow drunk can you get here?  Don't you feel a little guilty for getting really drunk here?\\n\\nPEDRO:  Yes, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is one of my favorite things.\\n\\nPEDRO:  This is your favorite thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nPEDRO:  Try it.  It's amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Gaze away disapprovingly all you like, Jesus.  I am happy now.\\n\\nOverlooking Granada, the hillside of Sacramonte is riddled with caves, many of them older than anyone even remembers.  Spanish gypsies or Gitanos have lived here in caves turned homes like this for hundreds of years.\\n\\nThey call this a juerga, an informal, intimate and spontaneous performance.  What jazz musicians might recognize as a jam session.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is it.  Granada.  The only place in the world where you get to see real flamenco in a cave.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Alissia (ph) like just about in Granada is an aficionado. Our host, Kuro (ph), is a poet, historian, and a patriarch of the Gitano community here.  An icon of the flamenco world.\\n\\nGitano.  You see travelers, Roma people are more embraced by the culture here than most other places in Europe.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have our own gypsies.  Those are ours.  Yes. We can tell you three things that we -- for sure we do here.  We do flamenco.  We do tapas.  And we do siestas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You do them well.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  We know how to live, don't we?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am going to have a drink.  Because we have 100 years to live.  To sleep, to dream, to do everything.  Pure emotions. The blood of gypsies boils.  You have seen how it is.  We make music that comes from our roots.  It was created for big spectacles.  It's music that comes from within.  When there is pain or joyful laughter, we sing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They dig deep for their material here.  It means something. They're telling you something about themselves.\\n\\nWhat's the word?  Duende.  What is Duende?  I've heard it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Duende is the artist reaching the sublime.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it an emotional state or a technical --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  No.  It doesn't have to do with passion. It's an ecstasy.  It happes a lot when one is in love.  Loved, but not loved back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is unhappiness necessary for great art?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's necessary, but magnifico.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very deep.  You'd have to think about that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have to be suffering at that moment.  It comes out good too when relaxed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And then you perform very well after a couple of these.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  I may not have Duende, but I have Valentine's.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And duende comes when horny.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I know that expression.  Wait a minute.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nighttime in Granada.  And it's time to pursue that greatest of Spanish traditions, tapas.  You may think you know what a tapa is.  Like you did have small bites at some fusion hipster bar where they did a whole lot of little plates.  Yes, that ain't a tapa.\\n\\nSo how often do you do this?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  I do it five days a week.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  It's rare not to do this.  But, you know, it's like on a weekend, you come out for a bunch.  Weekday, you come out for one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Latana, a little place run by (INAUDIBLE), Jesus and Louisa, brother and sister.  One bartender, one cook, taking care of everything.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tapa is for free.  That's the main issue of the tapa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you're just paying for the wine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if I were like a degenerate -- wino, I can still eat well?  As long as I can afford my wine, I eat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let us put this theory into practice.  With our first round of drinks comes this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tomato with bread, garlic, olive oil, and blended.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  I could pretty much eat that all day long.\\n\\nThat's right.  Tapas are free.  It shouldn't work, but somehow it does.  Another drink, another tapa.  Tomatoes, olive oil, bread.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Awesome.  It's amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So I just -- all I've got to do is keep drinking and I'd be eating like this?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Keep eating.  Yes.  Yes.  Although maybe you'd be interested in caviar here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But that's not included with my --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, that's another point of the tapas. Usually you have a few tapas.  And then, you know --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Use that to get hungry.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Exactly.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE) portion.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  They're just hooking you in with this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's all a scam.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  It is a scam.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Little couple of little nibbles, the next thing you know, you're ordering 200 grams of caviar.\\n\\nCaviar ain't free, my friend.  Delicious, entirely sustainable Spanish caviar from farm (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nZAMBONI:  It's funny, you can go into a place like this.  Get --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bread and tomato.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes.  Or --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Some high test caviar.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You guys are going to eat the whole thing in one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sorry, is there something wrong with that?  Not even married yet, it's nag, nag, nag.  Next wine.  Let's do it.\\n\\nAh, tapas.  What a novel concept.  There's even a verb for it. Tapayar.  Meaning to take tapas.  As in if we're going to tapayar some more, we're going to have to elbow past this crowd of Catholics here.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Is it extra insane because it's time of the Semana?  Yes, but it's always busy here, man.  The bar we were going is just on the other side.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Maybe we go around.\\n\\nWith parades crisscrossing the city in every direction, the steady drumbeat warns that your route is about to be cut off entirely for the next 40 minutes.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  We can across.  We can cross.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Zach, we have to go around.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Where?  Going around, going around, going around.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But we need to walk past.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Pardon.  Pardon.  Pardon.  Gracias.  Pardon, senora.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's impossible.  You cannot pass through here.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes, everybody has to -- it's the only way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  People take their processions very seriously here and aren't exactly accommodating to anyone who threatens to block the view.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  That was amazing, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  See?  Tell me (INAUDIBLE) in that music.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It isn't (INAUDIBLE) that music.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Finally, bar number two.  Oliver.  This place is always packed.  Beer, please.  And with it comes a delightful tapa of mussels steamed in butter and olive oil.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Look at that.  That's a great tapa.  Come on.  This is what's different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  People come in here and they will eat like this perfectly happy.  Perfectly content to forego the table, come on here and stand around and eat like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One's glass of wine comes with fried eggplant and honey, which sounds to me like it boorish (INAUDIBLE).  More wine accompanied by these delicious little clams.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the main event.\\n\\nNow we are talking.  Yes.\\n\\nThese langosteens, however, are not tapas and consequently not free. But worth it at any price.\\n\\nThat's so totally awesome.  We did good work here.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Anything else (INAUDIBLE) or should we go on?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, let's move on.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  All right.  Let's move on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As this death march of tapas continues, things start to get a little weird.\\n\\nThis is the story of my life.  He doesn't do this at home, does he?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNo, Zach.  Now I understand how you feel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Every day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.  Finally.  A little empathy.  I do like the increasingly meta-aspect of this show.  I should really be live streaming.  That would really be interesting.  Finally, Bar Gallardo. Just making it before closing.  Now let's be honest, we've had a lot to eat and drink at this point.  Some restraint needs to be shown.\\n\\nDude, if you want to eat -- OK.  Fried fish.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Little ones.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Little ones.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Then we're done.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And cheese.\\n\\nBut instead, three more beers, three more tapas.  Gees.  Little fried smelt and (INAUDIBLE), baby lamb chops.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  These are super good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These are super good.  I'm uncomfortable with the idea of something for nothing.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Right.  It's not something for nothing.  It's all --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's $3 for a glass of wine in some different (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes, but if somebody can get demand for it in the U.S., this will take off.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, never.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We will never have tapas culture in America.  Never.  Ever. So you're looking to change the entire day, from the minute you get up in the morning in America.  Not in the afternoon.  Are you out of your mind?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  I want to be in (INAUDIBLE), walk to my bar.  I want to have a little beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I want a golden unicorn that shits money.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBoth of those scenarios are equally likely.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every storybook kingdom needs a castle.  Granada, it's got a good one.  The Alhambra.  One of the most enchanted, inscrutable, maddeningly beautiful structures ever created by man.  Built on top of ninth century fortifications by the Nasrid Dynasty, then added to and added to as history unfolded through wars and tragedy and invasion and conquest.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  From the outside, it's very bare.  All you see are these tiny windows.  And it's projecting impenatrability.  But then you come in here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Zach has gone -- well, let's call it what it is.  A bit mad about the place.  The details, and there are a lot of them, can obsess a man.  Plus he's a cinematographer, so you can understand once he starts to really look around how that might get a grip on a guy whose profession is the intricate play between light and darkness.  ZAMBONI:  My theory is that they're trying to weave nature,\\n\\ncalligraphy, symbols.  These are all inscriptions within here. Inscriptions turned into graphics.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why because (INAUDIBLE) depict the words of God?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes, but what you can depict, and this is what this entire place is, is geometric systems.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nWhen the Nasrid Dynasty lived here, it was a harmonious space where light, shade, water, the transit of the moon and the stars were harnessed and glorified.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  I think the best assumption is nothing is random.  They came here and laid out everything according to --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A plan.  Yes.\\n\\nThis was a place for reflection.  Each element of design presumably intended to have effects both psychological and religious.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  It's really a cinematographer's paradise.  Everything is about light and man.  Obviously they weren't cinematographers but everything is framing for them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long did it take them to build this?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Hundreds of years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's why it takes so long for you to get the shot?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Oh, snap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In the builders' time, engineers, astronomies, mathematicians were like priests, magicians, possessors of divine knowledge of how the universe worked.\\n\\nDid they want to contemplate nature or did they want to conquer it, control it?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  I mean, they were certainly trying to emulate it.  You know, all their mathematics were really trying to figure out how nature worked, particularly the square roots and the repetition of pattern.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They saw mathematical patterns in the sky and on earth, the way water moved and rippled, the way things grew, the simple pine cone, a fern, a pomegranate, and they thought about the basic truths these things might represent.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  These symmetries can all be shuffled, spun on any point and they align again with themselves.  So if you stretched them out, for them they pointed to infinity.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We will understand all things.  ZAMBONI:  Through contemplating sacred geometry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did nature unfold, pattern itself?  Could the basic designs of nature, even if divine, be replicated in this magnificent structure?\\n\\nTrying to solve the root of God here.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Exactly.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An hour's drive from Granada, the Mediterranean.  Unlike much of Spain's coastline ruined by real estate, speculators and overdevelopment, the coast around here in (INAUDIBLE) is largely unspoiled.\\n\\nI'm on my way to a moraga, a tradition in these parts, best described as the local version of a beach barbecue.\\n\\nWorking the grill, Chef Juan Andres Morilla.  He heads the highly regarded El Claustro back in Granada.  We're joined by fellow chef, Rafael Luque, and some friends.\\n\\nYou were killing us with some good-looking food here.\\n\\nSome of that simple yet magical salmareho on toast.\\n\\nIt's one of my favorite things.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?  Amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fried tuna.  Flavor packed like tuna prosciutto.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some olive oil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hundred percent, extra virgin from Granada.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, it's spicy.  And bitter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Awesome.\\n\\nSpain is a beautiful country.  We're not even eating yet and it's good.  Oh, sweet.  Want mass.  That is like the best thing in the world.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want the whole thing?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This?  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chocolate.  This is the chocolate of the gods.\\n\\nSome grilled octopus and sea brim, and some nice pork tenderloin.  And my personal favorite, a particularly delicious morcia, flesh blood sausage.  Yes.  They put some (INAUDIBLE) coming on.  I got to squeeze.  I'm telling you.  The sexual metaphors are coming. Beautiful.  This feeling of -- yes.  Looking good.  Wow.  Look at that.  A lot of fat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Yes.  It's quite nice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Those were happy pigs.  Lazy pigs.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The ones we like.  The ones we breed here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, the pigs and the bulls are very happy here. Controlled, they're not.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  No (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  Enough with the work.  Let's eat.  Nice.  Awesome. Great meal.  Great, great, great.  Really.  This is the dream of all the world.  The dream is to live in Granada.  You know, work in the morning, have a one-hour in the afternoon, at night go out and have that life.  You know.  Go out and see your friends and eat tapa and drink red wine and be in a beautiful place.\\n\\nYou know, to have this kind of music and this food and this kind of culture and to look out the window and to see Spain.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Family.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Family is very, very, very important.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  See.  He did it right.  He's marrying into a Spanish family in Granada.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Great.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheating, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  He's very lucky.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very smart.  I know.  I know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And a smart guy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nLook, no one is going to dare dream of this because this is too much to dream for.  This is extraordinary.  But an ordinary life in Spain looks pretty good to me.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN:  The new swinging Zamboni lifestyle.  Rise early like 9:00 a.m. then it's down to the corner coffee shop for a cafe coleche con baso.  Maybe a small breakfast like toast with tomato.  No more than that.  Light.  Simple.  Because there will be a lot more eating and drinking today, and you want to be ready.\\n\\nBy 2:00 p.m., he's made his way back up hill to mom's place.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Every day I come here for lunch.  And I walk in and she says, get us two beers.  So I'll get two beers from the fridge and watch her cook.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody's home for Easter.  Maria Jose, Zach's soon to be mother-in-law, and Caloy, that's dad.  Plus Alejandro and Pedro, the soon-to-be brothers-in-law who you've already met.\\n\\nWhat this nice family doesn't realize is they aren't just gaining a son but also an annoying half drunk and extremely hungry Uncle Tony.\\n\\nAnd I know what happens here.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Yes.  So let's -- OK.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hamon.  Sitting there ready to be carved.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In Spain there is a saying, the best medicine is ham and chorizo.\\n\\nALEJANDRO:  But you know, got to prove us that he was able to cut the ham before he proposed to my sister.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think that's a completely reasonable policy.\\n\\nEventually the appropriate hour for lunch approaches.\\n\\nSo not to embarrass you publicly, but Maine is not exactly the Mediterranean of America.  Let's put it that way.  How is he adapting to the Spanish lifestyle?  I mean, let's face it, he's a mean --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's more Spanish than me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  In the first week he was like, I don't understand.  Week after, (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's interesting to see how you've made the transition. Cheers.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Remojon Granadino.  It's eaten during the Holy Week, especially in Granada.  BOURDAIN:  First off, this.  Bakalou salad.  Salt cod, egg, black\\n\\nolives, oranges, tomatoes dressed in olive oil.  Remember, this is Holy Week.  Maria Jose is preparing recipes that go back through the family so far that nobody knows exactly where they even came from.\\n\\nMigas, another iconic dish of Analucia.  Informally referred to as the shepherd's lunch as the story goes.  Born as a way to use old, hard bread and combine all the week's leftovers.  I'm told that every household in Spain has a variation.  What changes is what you put on it.  Today it's sardines, cod, chorizo, melon, and peppers.\\n\\nMan, that's a lot of good stuff in one bowl.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how often do you eat this well?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Every lunch is like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every lunch in your life.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Every day I'm here.  But lunch is --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Big.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Big.  Big lunch, siesta.  But you can't -- you know, I used to try to resist siesta.  And tou can't do it here.  Society will not accept you not taking a siesta here.  But that's the flaw of life here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That sort of begs the question now.  While I'm busy hating you for your life, how often do you getting a drunk a day?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Twice.  One and a half.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  No.  He doesn't get drunk.\\n\\nZAMBONI:  That is so Spanish, by the way.  Everybody has a very distinct opinion and it's completely different.  It's like this is a fact.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When my time comes, I pretty much want to die at a table like this.\\n\\nGood work, Zamboni.  Good work.\\n\\nSo, Zach, happy with the show?\\n\\nZAMBONI:  Hope we don't suck on television.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dude, I think I'm setting a pretty low bar.  I'm going to tell you this relaxed lifestyle, you know, lounging around eating and drinking.  And no nap is long enough for me.  Life is good.\\n\\nI envy you, Zach Zamboni.  And we're out.  Nice end.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n[20:00:47] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  Peru is a country that has historically driven men mad, mad for gold, for coca, for its magical ancient history.  But now there's something else drawing outsiders to its hidden mountain valleys.  We love the stuff.  We obsess about it, gorge on it and fetishize it.  I'm talking about chocolate.\\n\\nOnce a common treat, it's now becoming as nuanced as fine wine making the pursuit of the raw good stuff all the more difficult.\\n\\nI'm joining that hunt in remotist Peru, but not before I've re- immersed myself in the booming lima food scene.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I'm in Peru with this guy, Eric Ripert.\\n\\nERIC RIPERT, CHEF, LE BERNARDIN:  He was looking at this, he went into the tree.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's funny.\\n\\nChef of the world famous restaurant Le Bernardin in New York.  To look at where chocolate comes from, particularly our chocolate, the very expensive limited run designer chocolate bar business that Eric got me into last year.  So that's why we're in Peru.\\n\\nBut before we get all Indiana Jones, we're spending some time in Lima, as we like the capital city just fine.  And we have both of us, from previous trips, friends here.\\n\\nLima is the cultural hub and culinary capital of a country that has exploded in the last decade with scores of world class chefs, cooks, and restaurants.  It has long been considered to be one of the best food scenes in all of South America.\\n\\nThat was good.\\n\\nRIPERT:  How far away is the house?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's it.  Yes.  Five minutes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One of our friends here is chef restaurateur Coque Ossio. He's one of the best, most successful chefs in the country.  His family is something of a beloved culinary dynasty in Peru and a small fishing village about an hour south of Lima is where they spend their weekends.  Coque's mom, Marisa Guiulfo, is like Peru's Julia Childs and James\\n\\nBeard rolled into one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you for having us.\\n\\nA caterer, cookbook author, beloved icon of Peruvian gastronomy.\\n\\nYes, I'm going in.\\n\\nTo say one is fortunate to enjoy her hospitality would be an understatement.  Warm, generous, welcoming beyond belief.\\n\\nMARISA GUIULFO, COQUE OSSIO'S MOTHER:  Too bad you're going to have to leave so soon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nCOQUE OSSIO, CHEF RESTAURATEUR:  Normally, we have lunch late, like 5:00.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you nap before lunch or after?\\n\\nOSSIO:  Both.  No.  No.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sounds like paradise.  Wow.  Look at this.\\n\\nEvery weekend, Marisa opens the house to an ever changing mob of friends, visitors, drop-ins and family.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They do not skimp on the food.  Delicious, delicious things pour out of the kitchen, a torrent, a deluge of traditional Peruvian favorites.\\n\\nGUIULFO:  This is a (INAUDIBLE) salad with crab meat, yellow potato and avocado.  We love avocado.\\n\\n[20:05:00]  BOURDAIN:  House (INAUDIBLE) is like a tureen of crab meat, eggs, avocado and mashed yellow potatoes.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nGUIULFO:  This is delicious ceviche from the coast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful.\\n\\nBasically raw king fish fillets dressed with aji Amarillo and lime juice.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nGUIULFO:  That's scallops ceviche.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fresh scallops and lemon juice, garlic and aji (INAUDIBLE). Drum fish, braised in (INAUDIBLE), a corn based beer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They look fantastic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Spicy or not?\\n\\nGUIULFO:  This is very spicy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very spicy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And stuffed Riccotti peppers filled with ground beef and raisins, served with cheese.\\n\\nYes.  Wow.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Are we lucky or what?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We are lucky.\\n\\nAnd that's just the beginning.  There's so much more food there's no way we can show it all much less describe it.  It's incredible, overwhelming, invariably fresh and delicious and thrillingly different than what I'm used to.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  It's fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I could frankly get out of the chocolate business right now, put up a pup tent on Marisa's porch and pretty much dig in for the duration.  This is living.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Those fish are amazing.  It's so fresh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I want to be her next-door neighbor.\\n\\nRIPERT:  It's so good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So has Peruvian cuisine always been this diverse and this delicious and we're just discovering it or has it changed over the last 15 years?\\n\\nOSSIO:  It's changing any way.  You know, what you're eating now is the traditional food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There's so many products in Peru that are unfamiliar to people in the states.  When you eat this food it's not like well, this is something like -- no, it's not really -- it's not kind of like anything.  It's really awesome.\\n\\nGUIULFO:  All year-round.\\n\\nRIPERT:  The Ricotti is very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you do when you're homesick for Peruvian food and you're traveling?  There's really --\\n\\nOSSIO:  We take some chilies with us in the luggage.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWe're the perfect smugglers.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I believe you do it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate to say good-bye to this but it is what it is. Things to do and places to go.  Wild and apparently extremely rare cacao trees to visit.\\n\\nIncredible meal.  So happy.\\n\\nAll I can say if that people are anywhere near this nice on the rest of this trip, it's going to be OK.\\n\\nLima, city of kings, home to a third of Peru's people.  Locals escape by hanging out at the beach.  Why not?  When you can maybe get a tattoo while you're at it.  Is that sanitary?\\n\\nYou've been here before.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Oh, yes, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I take Eric's suggestion and we head over to see Chef Javier Wong, the uniquely nonconformist seafood specialist, famous for his incredible and uncompromising food and his flaming wok.  If Peru has a national dish, it's probably ceviche.  The freshest fish only needs the right cut, a little citrus and no heat.\\n\\nWhat's the most common thing that people do wrong?\\n\\nRIPERT:  The quality of the ingredients.  You don't do ceviche with something that is -- that is not fresh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRIPERT:  The cut is very important.  The thickness.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRIPERT:  And when you do the ceviche, you don't do it ahead of time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The whole place is served whatever menu he's doing that day, same for everybody.  And today, the flounder he got from the market is particularly nice, so that's what we're getting.  Generally thicker pieces to stand up to the spices acids.  First up an octopus and flounder ceviche.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I don't know what to tell you, man.  It's damn good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is good.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Is this spicy or not?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you ever been spanked in your life and enjoyed it? Yes, me neither.  I don't like pain.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Except if it's painful as the pepper.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Brutalized with a pepper.  I like.\\n\\nRIPERT:  That's really hot for you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (INAUDIBLE), a flounder dressed with pecans, lime, aji limo and sesame oil, which clearly Eric likes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  This is totally going to the Le Bernardin.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you're not like foraging in the cat skills for your inspiration?\\n\\n[20:10:03]  You basically just rip your ideas off from small businessmen?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nJAVIER WONG, CHEZ WONG:  It's OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Superb.\\n\\nRIPERT:  You want another little thing?\\n\\nWONG:  Sure.  Anthony has a good appetite.  It's incredible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chinese and Japanese immigrants came to Peru in great numbers in the 19th and 20th centuries as contract laborers and farmers, and their influence is felt here, particularly in the food, to a greater degree than anywhere else on the continent.  It's that influence and the ingredients of Amazonia and Andes that really distinguishes the food here as something special.\\n\\nWow.  What is this?  Tofu?\\n\\nWONG:  No.  Queso fresco, no?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a very (INAUDIBLE) combination, I mean, is that pineapple?  Where did that come from?  That's not traditional.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I mean, he looks Asian to me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRIPERT:  So I believe it's probably --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dude, his name is Wong.  I mean, unless he's a retired porn star -- this shouldn't be good but it is.  Working up a sweat on that one.  Might have a couple of more beers after this.  This goes sour and then have a nice nap, midday nap.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One more day in Lima, the chance to delve a bit further into the cuisine before things get a little more old school.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A special one we prefer here.  It has a kind of lime that we find in the jungle.  It has culantro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Culantro?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Culantro is like cilantro, with its long leaves.  Much more powerful in flavor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It would be wrong to not point out that Peru, along with Brazil, is at the forefront of a movement celebrating the incredible and unique larder of ingredients from the Andes and the Amazon. Flavors you find no place else on earth.\\n\\n[20:15:04]  There seems to be a lot of interest in the last decade into the Amazon because of its amazing spectrum of entirely new to most of us flavors of ingredients.\\n\\nPedro Schiaffino is at the cutting edge of exactly that territory. His restaurant Amaz explores the rivers, the ocean, the landscape of Peru, highlighting a range of products that are stunning in their diversity, and to us anyway, their newness.\\n\\nPEDRO SCHIAFFINO, AMAZ:  You've got bread fruit tuna, and the cashew sauce, with plantain vinegar.  And so the nut is a fruit in Brazil (INAUDIBLE).  We make these scallops with wild almond.\\n\\nRIPERT:  The almond is very, very soft, like the flavor of it.  It complements very well.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  And this one is fresh water shrimp dashi, made of maca roots and fresh water shrimps.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whole different flavor spectrum, right?  All new.  It's almost like you need a new section of your tongue.\\n\\nRIPERT:  It must be so exciting because they are basically an amazing garden with the Amazon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks good.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  This is a soup made of ham with peanuts and corn.  And it's called (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like the food.  I've enjoyed these cocktails, too. Cashew (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nRIPERT:  We're going to be wasted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We'll be fine.  Oh, whoa.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  So this is also tradition.  This is called Patarashca. They season the fish, they put it on a leaf and they cook it.  The fish is catfish.  In the Amazon we have like 200 types of catfish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And the flavor from the leaf, too.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  And here, we have (INAUDIBLE).  It's the second biggest fresh water fish in the world.  Underneath you have a puree called (INAUDIBLE), that is a palm fruit and a reduction of fermented wild (INAUDIBLE) called yuka.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Fermented.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  Yes, this is -- I would say toxic or --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or poisonous.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  Poisonous.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  So they let it ferment and it becomes -- you can eat it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These fish are unbelievable.  They get up to like 600 pounds and they're swimming in water no deeper than a rice paddy.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Giant.  They're like dinosaur fish.  Everyone has been saying for years that Peru is going to be the next big thing as far as restaurants and --\\n\\nRIPERT:  It is.  This really proves it.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  And we have chili pepper made with cashew nuts and these are ants.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Wow.  They're huge.\\n\\nSCHIAFFINO:  They're huge ants.\\n\\nRIPERT:  OK.  You want to try it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Totally.  You're not loving that, are you?\\n\\nRIPERT:  No.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Imagine, you took a lot of acid and then you ate that whole bowl of ants and then you go home and you experience violent diarrhea, and like you're tripping, it's like 4:00 in the morning and you turn around and you look at the toilet and like, all these ant heads floating around in there.  It would be cool.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  It would be cooler, Tony, I can't wait.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER) BOURDAIN:  So now that we've confirmed what we already knew, that Peru's food is unequivocally awesome, it seems proper that we take a trip back in time to meet the forebearers of this country's rich cultural legacy.\\n\\nThe Larco Herrera Museum in Lima has a massive collection of pre- Colombian artifacts.  And looking at them, you get an idea of what these ancient peoples were like, how they lived.\\n\\nWow.  I mean, this is like the real stuff.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I think so.  The real deal, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Gold necklaces.  You see where the Spanish just freaked out when they came here, turned into like maniacal greed heads.\\n\\nBut history does not have to be boring.  It can be sexy.\\n\\nI don't know whether you knew this, but I have an aficionado of early erotica of pre-Colombian and post-Colombian heiress, you know, like pottery of people doing it.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  I should have known that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Turns out things could get pretty interesting back in the day.  Oh, yes.  Those guys can get crazy, get wild and apparently very kinky.\\n\\nThe Erotic Gallery.  Wow.  There you go.  That's a conversation starter.\\n\\nI take Eric to the pre-Colombian boning section, actually the erotic pottery section.\\n\\nSlip of the tongue.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which sounds about as much fun as an all nude renaissance fair, but is actually pretty cool.  Nothing new under the sun that these pre-Colombian horn dogs didn't think of first.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  A chicken.  I'm not sure I understand this one, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think we frown on that these days.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[20:20:10]  BOURDAIN:  Wow, they're doing it under a blanket.  This must be after the Spanish arrived to teach them shame.  Skeletons with boners.\\n\\nRIPERT:  They are zombies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Getting zombie old-fashioned.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes, Tony.  I really appreciate your knowledge.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I wonder whether this was decorative or whether this was really porn.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I think they put ain't closet somewhere or something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I bet this was right on the table.  Come on in, have a cup of tea.  Sit down.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHere's some animal and animal action.  It's pretty awesome.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  I thought this is interesting.  Yes.  I'm happy we made it here, Tony.  That was an enlightened moment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Something about steamy, XXX, pre-Colombian erotica always makes me hungry.  Luckily at night, Lima comes alive with the smell and the familiar enticing sound of sizzling meat.  It's time for delicious, screamingly hot, garlicky spicy flavor jack street meats. And as anybody who knows me is well aware I love me some street meats.\\n\\nOSSIO:  The street food in Peru is starting to disappear.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  Why?\\n\\nOSSIO:  Because, you know, the neighbors --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, the neighbors complain?\\n\\nOSSIO:  Complain.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our friend Coque brought us to this place.  To Dona Pochita, a street stall named for the lady who runs the joint.  They specialize in one thing.\\n\\nAnticuchos is (INAUDIBLE) you want for skewered meat.  This stuff, they say, goes back all the way to the Incas and was as immediately popular with the Spanish conquistadors as it is today.\\n\\nThat looks good.\\n\\nWhich is to say, I must have some.  Traditionally a mix of beef hearts and other animal hearts.\\n\\nOSSIO:  Chicken hearts and gizzards.  And there's tripe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMarinated in garlic, cumin, and onion, maybe a little vinegar.\\n\\nOh, yes.\\n\\nGrill that up and pile it high.\\n\\nThese are not small portions.  These people are giving me mountains of food.\\n\\nOK.  Rolling up.\\n\\nIt does not get any better.\\n\\nVoila.  Let's do it.\\n\\nMan, that's awesome.\\n\\nOSSIO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beef heart.  Yes.  That is some magic right there.\\n\\nRIPERT:  It's very garlicky.  The marinade.  It's nice.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nOSSIO:  Chicken heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is seriously tasty.  The beef heart or the chicken heart, the texture is so nice.  All right.  I'm maxed out.  Really delicious.  Excellent.\\n\\n[20:23:35]\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:27:06]  BOURDAIN:  The city of Chiclayo lies about 400 miles northwest of Lima.  It's Peru's fourth largest city with over half a million people living there.  It's our next stop, the staging area for our trip to the mountains to find our cacao.\\n\\nChocolate.  I mean, we know we like the stuff.  But how is it made? Where does it come from?\\n\\nColumbus was the first European to encounter cacao beans on a Mayan trading canoe off the coast of Honduras.  He's said to have grabbed both crew and cargo and brought them back to Spain.  A few decades later a Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortez came across Aztecs using the sacred beans of a drink.  It was considered the drink of the gods.\\n\\nLike most expensive delicious things from abroad, the largely inbred and frequently syphilitic European royalty did their best to keep up what's was fast becoming a craze for hot chocolate to themselves.  But it soon found its way to America.  And in 1765, the first chocolate factory opened in New England.\\n\\nChiclayo's main market is a massive one-stop shop for all things chocolate as well as just about everything else under the sun.\\n\\nOh, you have your animal skulls.  That's tempting.  Haircut?\\n\\nRIPERT:  I'm good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Cacao.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Those are the raw beans?\\n\\nRIPERT:  That one is toasted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Toasted?\\n\\nRIPERT:  And then she --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Grinds it?\\n\\nRIPERT:  And then she puts it in a mold.  Gracias.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bitter.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Not sweet at all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Actually, here we are in the area of the market, and I believe, where they are, what they call santarias.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ripert is -- how shall I put it?  Well, let's just say he's got more of a spiritual side than me.\\n\\nRIPERT:  This is all the ingredients that you need for the shaman (ph) to bless the rest of the cacao.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nSo he's got us shopping for what I guess you'd call shamanic supplies.\\n\\nWhich place do we go into?  I like the lady with the sunglasses.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes, I like it, too.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMedical medicinal herbs with supposed magical properties.  And stuff for this shaman dude to bless us and our cacao crop.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And red and white carnations.\\n\\nRIPERT:  This one is amazing.  Smells really good and supposedly purified the house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Smells like hippie.\\n\\nRIPERT:  But it's interesting, the shamans are very, very well respected in the Inca and the region.  They cure everything, they do ceremonies.\\n\\n[20:30:02]  BOURDAIN:  Good?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  I say we're good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our journey continues by road as we leave Chiclayo and head east towards the Andes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Originally two hours north from here.  You have the Indians welcome you with a little --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With blow darts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nBut before we get too deep into the mountains, we're stopping off to meet our shaman.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Anthony, he's going to teach us how to do the bath for the plants and for us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nRIPERT:  He's cleaning.  All the negative vibrations.  Close your eyes.  He cleaned you and he wished you a lot of success.  Especially in the back, in the neck and the back.  That's here, and the chest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We wanted a blessing for our cacao harvest.  We got this. My aura is now cleaner than Gwyneth Paltrow's colon after a three- month's juice cleanse.\\n\\nTo a successful harvest.\\n\\nBut we're not done.  We have to transport this stuff to our trees and finish the job ourselves.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I know you don't believe it but the energy has changed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I'm serious.  I'm not -- I'm not joking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Listen, I'm not disbelieve you.  I have an open mind.\\n\\nEric and I are heading to the Maranon Canyon, eight hours by car from Chiclayo, well into the Andean Highlands.  On the way, we stop for lunch and meet up with this guy.\\n\\nChris Curtin, master chocolatier and our business partner in this knuckle-headed adventure.\\n\\nOne of life's great joys is eating in a Peruvian market.\\n\\nCHRIS CURTIN, CHOCOLATIER:  I love markets.  It's nice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Basically a hen soup.\\n\\nThat's good.  Where in the world does chocolate come from?\\n\\nCURTIN:  Well, 45 percent of course come from Ivory Coast in Africa. But we don't deal in those beans just because of political situations. BOURDAIN:  There was this stuff, the special chocolate.\\n\\nCURTIN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which pretty much what we're here to look at.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where it comes from, what's involved.\\n\\nEric ate some of Chris's chocolate, heard about these wild cacao trees he was sourcing from and in Peru and promptly got me involved in this designer chocolate bar business.\\n\\nI'm a rather famous guy that really -- I never really cared about desserts.  You on the other hand, you are -- you eat chocolate every day?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  Every day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And so here we are, three men and a chocolate bar.  Good thing for the world or exploitive opportunism, yet to be determined. What do I, after all, know about chocolate?\\n\\nNext, the freaking nut.\\n\\nRIPERT:  It's good like that, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like Oliver Twist.  Yes.  We used to eat like in the orphanage.\\n\\n[20:34:20]\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:37:56]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Maranon Canyon.  We're headed to meet some of the farmers that supply the beans that make our chocolate and get me an education in all things cacao.  The roads up into these mountains can be tricky, so we've got to take care of the local vigilante dudes who run a roadblock here outside of town.\\n\\nIt looks like a shakedown but they're a welcome sight.  This hill, where cars have to slow down, was where all sorts of highway men and miscreants used to waylay travelers like us.  So these guys stepped in to take care of business.\\n\\nWow, that was a big shotgun.  That will -- that will shoot through an engine block.  Actually, I don't really know but I'm assuming.\\n\\nAt this time of year, there's also the rain and mud, which can mean flooded streets and streams that cut right across the roads.  And there's this, the river.  In the best of circumstances, a fairly adventurous way to get your vehicles across, a long line across a fast moving current, ferry propelled only by the flow of water.  But today, the river is too high and the current too fast.\\n\\nRiver running a little high.\\n\\nIt's these smaller boats or nothing.\\n\\nWhen dealing with complex transportation issues, the best thing to do is pull up with a cold beer and let somebody else figure it out.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.  Let's go in the boat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To my crew, I say good luck.  We're headed for what looks like a bar on the other side.\\n\\nPunta Cervesa, por favor.\\n\\nAnd let me tell you, it's quite a ride.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I'll go the last.  Hey, water inside the boat.\\n\\n[20:40:08]  The boat is sinking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You got to go down and then up, just right.  We make it to the other side reasonably dry.\\n\\nBeer?\\n\\nThe Maranon Canyon is home to a wide range of species including and most interesting to us a strain of cacao previously thought to be almost extinct.  A few years ago the valley's cacao trees were genetically tested at a USDA lab and proven to have identical DNA to one of the rarest forms of cacao in the world, this stuff.  The real deal.  Pure national.\\n\\nDon Fortunato is our cacao connection, a farmer whose family has been working these mountains for over 40 years.\\n\\nCURTIN:  They're absolutely beautiful when they start out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really cookie looking pods come right off the trunk of the tree.  This sort of look like somebody, you know, glued them to the side of a tree.  This is a once a year crop?\\n\\nCURTIN:  It grows continuously but this is a peak seasons.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Try that.  Then put one in your mouth.  Bite it and you see those -- the nibs inside?  Those are the cocoa leaves.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So where does chocolate come from?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThe bean.  OK.  Here's where chocolate comes from.  The trees produce pods.  You split open the pods and take out the beans.  The buyer sundries the beans, then roasts them.  After roasting, the beans are extracted from their shells and ground up, producing chocolate liqueur.  Mix this concentrate with milk, sugar, cocoa butter and you get what we call commercial chocolate.\\n\\nNow our chocolate bar sells for a nosebleed price that's high by even premium chocolate standards.  So where does the money go?  And most importantly to me and Eric, are we doing a good thing?\\n\\nHere's how it breaks down.  The raw cacao costs one chunk.  Labor, the inner sleeve, this much.  Design, box, packaging, this much.  Various sundry equipment and miscellaneous, another small chunk.  Chris, me and Eric each get a slice out of every bar.  That leaves this much, which the retailer takes.  Chef bleeding heart hippie here has already convinced me to give whatever meager profits we make off our first bar to a local charity.\\n\\nSo what's unusual about these pods?  These beans?\\n\\nCURTIN:  Extremely high quality flavor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thought not around for a while?\\n\\nCURTIN:  This was, what, almost all chocolate made over 120 years ago and now making a giant comeback.  I mean, the chocolate here, this is a once-in-a-life find.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now about 40 percent of the beans from these trees have got white cacao beans mixed in.  The rest are purplish in color.  But we've heard of an ultra rare group of trees elsewhere further up the mountains that produce pods with 100 percent all white pure beans and that's something me and Eric are very interested in down the road. But for now, Don Fortunato's daughter has prepared us a traditional Peruvian mountain meal.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Kuinas.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Kuinas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kuinas are rice dumplings with boiled egg, chicken and achuete inside.\\n\\nRIPERT:  This is amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And not surprisingly some cuy or guinea pig of which there seems to be many around for the taking.  This preparation served with a cacao sauce.\\n\\nThat's good.\\n\\nAll of this food is delicious.\\n\\nSo chocolate, (INAUDIBLE) chunk and you say a luxury food item.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right?  This is an area that's abundant with coffee, chocolate, fruit.  How's life for the locals?  RIPERT:  He says about 20 years ago, 25 years ago, it was easier for\\n\\nhim.  He was planting soybeans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRIPERT:  And coffee.  And he was making much more money.  And then he didn't plant soybeans any longer and then the coffee production went down so therefore he had a financial struggle for a while and now with the cacao trees that they are planting, he has no more stress and is fairly upbeat himself.\\n\\n[20:45:00]\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:48:46]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I'm in the Maranon Canyon in Peru with my partner in chocolate bars, Chef Eric Ripert.  Eric and I are intrigued by these ultra rare, all white beans we heard from Don Fortunato.  So we set up a meeting with another farmer, Don Edilberto elsewhere in the valley.\\n\\nNow we thought it would be a nice gesture given all high test culinary talent between us to make him and his family dinner in return for his hospitality.\\n\\nWhat are you thinking?\\n\\nRIPERT:  Look there.  Squabs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Squabs.  Butterfly marinade, grill?\\n\\nRIPERT:  We could do that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With a nice sausages.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Nice sausage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which would be nice to throw in with stew.  Chicken, onion, maybe some peppers, a little bit of spice.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Chicken chorizo and potatoes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So we're kind of moving into these Spanish or what's it called?  Sarsuela.  But --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nRIPERT:  Sarsuela.  And we can even use shrimp from the guy.  Shrimp and chicken works.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That sounds like a plan.\\n\\nRIPERT:  You have 24?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Successful.  RIPERT:  Yes.  So far.  But wait until we arrive there.  It's going to\\n\\nbe interesting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don't be a downer, man.  I'm optimistic.\\n\\n[20:50:06]  We arrive at the village with the fabled white cacao beans who said to be growing and meet with the village's unofficial mayor and our cacao farmer, Don Edilberto, who will lead us to the trees.\\n\\nRIPERT:  OK.  We're going to follow him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was depicted as a short walk up a slight incline turns out to be an epic hump up one hill after another.\\n\\nRIPERT:  When you tire up, you tell us.  We stop, OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When you slump to the ground and urinate all over myself, that will probably be a tip that I probably want to stop.  Another reason I hate the Swiss mountains.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I love mountains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Eric, who grew up in the Pyrenees, is up the slopes like a gazelle.  Me, I feel every year of my misspent life with every step.\\n\\nOh, geez.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is cacao.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are we there?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  No, no, no, we're not there.  He's a baby.  He's rafting because he has only 22 trees.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I wish I could hear you over the sound of my exploding capillaries.\\n\\nRIPERT:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By the time we get near the fabled trees, I'm toast. Gasping for air, waiting to puke from the altitude and the exertion.\\n\\nSo, tell us again, what's unique about these trees?\\n\\nCURTIN:  Just because they are all white beans, all white.  Which is a rarity.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So these are the only known all-white 100 pure.\\n\\nCURTIN:  That's right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  And why is that good?\\n\\nCURTIN:  It's a new variety and gives new flavor profiles to it.  BOURDAIN:  A good flavor profile?\\n\\nCURTIN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I assume because I've humped up a here -- excuse me.  Oh, nice catch.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Watch your fingers, man.  Yes.  That's it.\\n\\nCURTIN:  There we go.  And I'm going to repeat myself.\\n\\nRIPERT:  All white.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Remember the shaman?  Well, we still have stuff to do with that package you gave us.  We do, presumably, want a good cop.  Better get right with the spirit world.\\n\\nOh, geez.\\n\\nShaman juice thrown around, the purified soil and there you go, chocolate magnates.\\n\\nWell, good luck, dude, to a good harvest.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Done deal.\\n\\n[20:52:50]\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[20:56:40]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The trip downhill unsurprisingly is a lot easier on me. Time for me and Chef Ripert to get cooking.  Back to basics, wood fire, ingredients from the morning market.  In this old school recycling system.  Here, little fella.\\n\\nRIPERT:  I'm ready for the chicken.\\n\\nRIPERT:  And red wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Notice how I neatly maneuvered you into the chef job?\\n\\nRIPERT:  So now we have to make the mashed potato and we're good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Eric's mashed potato secret, around 50 percent butter.  The glory that is France.  I think they call it gout.\\n\\nOK.  Let's do it.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Gracias.\\n\\nCURTIN:  You guys can cook.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Some say.\\n\\nRIPERT:  He's the only guy who has the white cacao.  He asked all the farmers of the village.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nRIPERT:  To do exactly what he has done, so the farmers are starting to copy him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRIPERT:  And he's happy because it's going to bring wealth, in the village, in the valley and the community.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Afterwards Don Edilberto makes a traditional unsweetened hot chocolate preparation, ground cacao anybodies, no sweetener, no milk, no sweeteners, no nothing, just like the ancient kings liked it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Gracias.  The real deal.\\n\\nRIPERT:  It's only water, and this is what they -- they will use it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Before chocolate hit Europe.  This is what the Aztec kings would drink.\\n\\nRIPERT:  They would be jealous right now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You'll get yours eventually.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gracias.  Mucho gracias.  Salud.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's good salud.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Salud.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Gentlemen, to education.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So did we do the right thing?  Is it all right for two New Yorkers to make money, however much, or however little, off the work of struggling farmers in a faraway lane?  Fortunato, Edilberto, Chris, everybody down the line, all the way to the families who pick the pods off the trees, seem pretty happy to be doing what they are doing, but do I want to be in the chocolate business?\\n\\nThat's something I'm going to have to figure out.  But for now one last thing needs to be done to fulfill our shamanic obligations.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Guys, you have to get out.  The guy is coming with his bike, and he doesn't care.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A bridge, a bundle of eucalyptus leaves.  A badly working lighter got to get right.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Smells like (INAUDIBLE).  Got a lighter?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We need to burn this stuff and pass it around our bodies three time.\\n\\nRIPERT:  Got something or ont?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, too moist.  Oh, you got it, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Smoking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's smoking.  I'm going to get it.  Hold on.  Now I've got it.\\n\\nLet's do it.\\n\\nRIPERT:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's coming.  I got it.  We did it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Over.\\n\\nRIPERT:  OK.  Done.  Hey.

We see things differently, don\\'t we?\\n\\nMadagascar, exotic unspoiled paradise or microcosm for the end of times.\\n\\nAntananarivo, Tana for short, Madagascar\\'s crowded chaotic capital city.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  How are you doing, man?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Base camp.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wow.  That\\'s quite a rain.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  I don\\'t know.  I\\'m not sure if I can be in front of the camera.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just ignore them.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  I\\'m so used to controlling everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Darren Aronofsky, director of the film\\'s \"Pi,\" \"Requiem for a Dream,\" \"The Wrestler,\" \"Black Swan,\" and as it would turn out, sort of appropriate to our location, \"Noah.\" He asked me if he could go along on a trip with us.  I said, where do you want to go.\\n\\nSo, Madagascar.  I knew almost nothing about it.  I knew it was an animated film that I\\'ve seen a lot of times in my car.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  I guess it\\'s one of the more extreme distant places that you hear about but you know you\\'ll never go to unless something really weird summons you.  And you\\'re sort of that weird force. [21:05:06] BOURDAIN:  We\\'re on an island in the Indian Ocean.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Right\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With this amazing ethnic mix, incredible landscape. Something like 80 percent of the animals here don\\'t exist anywhere else.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  What does it mean when an ecosystem goes out of balance? What is the blowback?  Here, you can see the blowback, you know, people have been cutting down the forest now suddenly you don\\'t have soil anymore and you can\\'t grow anything anymore.  It\\'s a real situation.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There we go.\\n\\nAn important question.  You are a vegetarian.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Yes.  And it just sort of happened with the release of \"Noah.\"  In scripture, he is a vegetarian as was Adam and Eve.  Humans weren\\'t given permission to eat the animals until after the flood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ll see who is doing better after the end of days.\\n\\nA little social experiment here.\\n\\nMadagascar was settled, best we can tell, around 700 A.D. by people from what is know Indonesia, later by Africans.  In 1895, the French took it, killed off a substantial number of people in the process, and as they do, left behind beautiful buildings and the French language. When independence came in 1960, it was sudden and ill prepared for. Continuing political incompetence has left most of Madagascar\\'s 22 million people living on less than $2 a day.\\n\\nDo you know this place?  Do eat here?\\n\\nROSSI:  Yes.  Wednesday, Saturday, before going out, before going tonight club.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First meal in country and I suggested this place.

We have oil -- but our political leaders most of the time are crook.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  How much does the environmental issues matter to the people or is it just about survival?\\n\\nROSSI:  They don\\'t care.  The international community, they paid a lot of money to protect the forest.  You protect the monkey.  You don\\'t protect the people.  I eat the monkey.  If I\\'m hungry, I eat them.

Exactly.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:10:00]\\n\\nMARIETTE ANDRIANJAKA, MALAGASY CHEF:  Tell me what you think of this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m looking forward to this.  It\\'s a very famous dish, goose.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Goose and the language is the shredded meat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very cool.\\n\\nThere\\'s always someplace where the flame is kept burning, history kept alive, however faintly.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  This is the stuffing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These days in Madagascar\\'s capital city, it\\'s left to Mariette.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  The epitome of the cooking is the way Mariette cooks it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  During the colonial period, Mariette was a frequent culinary ambassador.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Harry Bellefonte.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The go-to chef for visiting presidents and royalty.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The success story, her mansion high atop Oatville, the former neighborhood of choice for aristocrats and colonizers alike.\\n\\nThough semi-retired, Mariette continues to entertain guests from time to time.\\n\\n[21:15:03] ANDRIANJAKA:  So this is broth with chicken and ginger.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These dishes marry mostly disappeared Malagasy royal cuisine with the techniques and training of the classical French.\\n\\nSo moisten the rice with a broth?\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Exactly, with the broth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, look at this.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  This is the vegetable lasa (ph), lasa (ph) is one the side dishes.  It\\'s like a salad.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Cauliflower and carrots:\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  String beans. Most Malagasy don\\'t eat meat at every meal because it\\'s expensive. Most would eat rice, broth with vegetables and that\\'s it.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  I can do fine here.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Yes, you would do fine here.  Yeah, absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a country that is very rich in natural resources.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Madagascar, we have a lot of things that a lot of people want.  For example, the trafficking of rosewood, prospecting for oil, for gas, and then don\\'t leave anything for the rest of the country. But this is an island paradise.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  And it is disappearing very, very quickly.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  A lot of our forests are being burned down because people don\\'t have land for which to grow their crops.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The best case scenario that everybody seems to raise is ecotourism will save the day.  The local people will be what?\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Working for wages, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cleaning rooms, cooking, and performing traditional ethnic dances.\\n\\nANDRIANJAKA:  Yeah, absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To me, this is not an ideal option.  And we see it...\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  What\\'s an ideal option, though?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Heading south from Tana, it\\'s a very different country out there, where rice is the difference between life and death.\\n\\nBetween the traditional slash-and-burn agriculture that\\'s existed here since this island was first settled and the imperative of charcoal as heat source, 90 percent of the forests and jungles that covered Madagascar are gone.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anything?\\n\\nDR. PATRICIA WRIGHT, PRIMATOLOGIST:  Not yet.  They\\'re very elusive. They\\'re very difficult to see.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thanks largely to the work of Dr. Patricia Wright, over 4,000 hectors of forest have been set aside and protected with the creation of Ranomafana National Park.\\n\\nHer recently completed research station is a state-of-the-art complex that reminds one of that cynical Spielberg franchise -- what was it -- Jurassic Merch (ph)?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Here he is.  He\\'s right next to me.  Can you see him?\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, wow.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Really right next to me.\\n\\nHello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The area provides essential habitat for the golden bamboo lemur, a species Dr.  Wright discovered here in 1986, and the greater bamboo lemur, previously thought extinct.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  There\\'s only 500 of these in the world in the whole wild.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Really?  What\\'s the biggest pressure on the population?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Slash-and-burn agriculture.  No question.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWRIGHT:  There he is.  Look at it.  Beautiful.  It\\'s so nice.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Whoa.\\n\\nHe\\'s pissing.\\n\\nHe\\'s taking a leak right now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hopefully, that\\'s not an editorial statement.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Yeah.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Yeah.\\n\\nLook.  This is the kind of bamboo shoots that the lemurs love.  It\\'s full of protein and it\\'s full of cyanide.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The cyanide not a problem for them?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  They can tolerate all kinds of cyanide.  The cyanide comes straight through when they poop.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Do they know how they get it through their system?\\n\\n[21:20:00] WRIGHT:  We\\'re working on that.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  OK.\\n\\nWhat is the dew on the outside of it?  Just dew?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Careful.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Oh, don\\'t touch.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  How is your finger feeling?\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  It felt a little sharp, but like a fuzzy sharp.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Yeah, fuzzy surface, you just wait a bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, like fiberglass.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Are you serious?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Yes, it\\'s just like fiberglass actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'ll leave tiny, tiny little sharp...\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  If I lick my finger, am I going to die?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  Probably.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Are you serious?  Can it go through the skin now that I\\'ve touched it?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  No.  You have to eat it.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hopes for \"Black Swan 2, The Revenge\" were dashed today when...\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Wow.  One right above you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Has the film \"Madagascar\" been good for the lemur business?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  I think the cartoon really woke up the world to the fact hat there was a place called Madagascar, although many of people don\\'t think it really exists.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  So what do you think happens?  How hard is it to maintain the forests?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  It\\'s incredibly hard.  You know, we\\'ve been working with the villagers around the park and I think they really do understand the value of these extraordinary lemurs and the value of the forests.  And the economic value of tourism is tremendous for this country.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:25:00]\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The boundaries of Ranomafana Park protect what they can of Madagascar\\'s rapidly diminishing rain forest, but it\\'s not all about lemurs and rare species of unspoiled beautiful places.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  These are the Tenalla people.  These are the people of the forest.  This is the fifth time they\\'ve had to change their location of the village because they just slash-and-burn agriculture.\\n\\nWRIGHT:  This ceremony today is a ceremony to celebrate the fact that 17 people from the village (inaudible) are going to donate their land to conservation.  It won\\'t be cut down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Before the Tenalla land can officially become a part of the park, the gods, the ancestors, somebody must be appeased.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And that, as it often does, means that something must die.\\n\\nDo you see this a lot?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  I usually don\\'t when this is happening.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For someone with as dark a world view, judging from his films anyway, as the newly vegetarian, Mr.  Aronofsky, he seems unusually uncomfortable with the bleeding realities of local custom.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Do you see them?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Preferring instead to \"trip the light fantastic\" in the rain forest idle.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you make this argument, when you\\'re in duress, to protect an area, a forest, when the forest means fuel, food?\\n\\nWRIGHT:  What we\\'ve had to do, of course, is make their lives better in exchange.  Health projects, education projects, tourism.  Many of the people work as tour guides.  They work in the hotels.  They have work.  They didn\\'t have any work when I got here.  But also the benefits of researchers.  We hire 85 people full-time.  I asked the director of the Ranomafana National Park, where\\'s your village that you lived in when you were a little girl?  That\\'s on one side of the park.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The ancestors presumably OK with the land transfer, it\\'s time to party.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dr. Wright worked hard to establish Ranomafana Park with the stated aim of protecting the absolutely unique flora and fauna here and reducing human pressures on the area.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This, however, is the face of human pressure, just so we\\'re clear.\\n\\n[21:30:05] ARONOFSKY:  Hey, take care, guys.\\n\\n(OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  We\\'re right on the edge of the park.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  And right on the edge, literally, is where they built the power lines and where they\\'re slashing and burning.  We were trying for landscapes like this in \"Noah.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sort of a post-apocalyptic wasteland thing going on, right?\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  The road.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look, all the original fauna and flora in New York City and Chicago and Detroit and Los Angeles are gone.  We don\\'t feel too guilty about that.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  That\\'s the argument of all these developing countries is you did it.

People hop off and on, load and unload fruit, lychees, bananas.  While a few foreigners on board watch.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Can we get some peanuts?  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And there are vendors selling food and drink, which is increasingly a necessity since as the supposed eight-hour trip is said to sometimes approach 18.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  All right.  So we got a shaker.  We got an umbrella, champagne.\\n\\nYou let the train pour for you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  This is the lychee.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That smells good.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Darren woke early and hit the hotel kitchen to make the necessary fresh lychee puree for festive cocktails.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Wait, wait, wait.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.  It\\'s not bad.  It\\'s not bad at all.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  OK.  It\\'s a nice summery drink.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The lychee makes it.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  The lychee makes it, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do we call this?  The golden lemur would be good.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  The golden lemur.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Flashes of everyday life, the struggle to live, to eat, viewed from a moving train, then gone.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  (Inaudible) different areas of Madagascar burning everywhere you can see.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After seven hours or so...\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  We\\'re coming into a town.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... the imperatives of food, any food, become ever more urgent.\\n\\nThis is it.

I would be unhappy if I saw that coming across my pillow.\\n\\nAh.\\n\\nDude, it\\'s a chicken.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  I know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A rooster.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  You\\'re talking about spiders and chickens.\\n\\nThat lobster is smelling good.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  No, they\\'re disgusting.  They\\'re like giant insects walking.  And what do they eat?  What do they eat?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Corpses.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Corpses.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dead things.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You are such a Debbie Downer.\\n\\nYou\\'re such a downer.\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  You were born here.

Oh, thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s one of those days where the artifice of making television threatens to move dangerously into cruelty.\\n\\nWhat are you guys eating over here?\\n\\nWho gets to eat and when becomes a pressing concern to the two of us?\\n\\nARONOFSKY:  Can we get the kids eating?  Can we hand out the food?\\n\\n[21:50:00] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In a local culture like this, first ladies serve the men.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And then we eat, then the kids eat later.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  I got you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s like a caste system.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s not like our system but it\\'s a system.\\n\\nThe kids are getting ready for theirs over there.\\n\\nAnd it becomes clear that, yes, everybody will eat.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nCome to daddy.\\n\\nThat\\'s good, dude.  You picked a bad time to become a vegetarian.  You really did.  Not bad.\\n\\nThe food is amazing.  There\\'s some really good cooks at work here today.  And really amazing.\\n\\nAnd then the music starts and the dancing.\\n\\nAnd as so often happens, the not so spontaneous made-for-TV party becomes a real party.\\n\\nAnd we all, for a little while anyway, forget about where we came from and where we might be tomorrow.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:55:00]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hallelujah.

       " '\\n[21:00:00]  ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  And I guess that\\'s what it comes down here.  All of it.  Led here.  I write a book, I get a TV show, I live my dreams, I meet my hero.  Two old men on a beach.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Everything changes.  Nothing changes at all.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Drinking at 4:30 in the afternoon, it\\'s the perfect time, when the light is just right.  It\\'s important.  Also it\\'s not too crowded.  It\\'s quiet.  A man can have a drink, a pint, in a dignified fashion, free of care.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ice, son?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Here you go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you so much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So you\\'re on holiday?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sort of.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s your first time in Glasgow?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, I\\'ve been in a number of times before.  I haven\\'t been in the oldest pub before.  Oldest in --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  1510.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  1510.  Amazing.\\n\\n(voice-over):  From my very first time, it was Glasgow, my favorite city in Scotland, one of my favorite cities on earth.  I was going to say one of my favorite cities in Europe, but is Glasgow Europe?  I don\\'t think so.  It feels somehow older than that.\\n\\nTo many outsiders, Glasgow is seen as a hard-scrabble, even fearsome place, a place that history has moved on from, but there is definitely a sense here that something different is around the corner.  UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR:  It\\'ll be one of the most important events\\n\\nin Scottish and British history.  More than four million people will decide whether Scotland should stay in the U.K. or become an independent country.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR:  Will Scotland stay or will it leave the union?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR:  Scottish independence could mark the beginning of the end of the U.K. as we know it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But in the end, 55 percent of Scotts voted to stay in the union.  That left almost half the population still hungry for independence.  And with 17.5 percent of teenagers voting yes, England had its undies in very much in a bunch over the possibility of an unraveling of the union with Scotland.  It\\'s an idea that is overwhelmingly popular in this city above all others.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Glasgow is a gutsy city.  A different outlook.  A new generation.  But I still here the cries of yesterday.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why does the possibility of independence have such a powerful hold on Glasgow?  The past.  Glasgow has along endured, among other things, a reputation for being the most violent area in the U.K. It\\'s a familiar cycle, analogous in  many ways to what we see elsewhere: hard times, a disappearing manufacturing base, unemployment, a general sense of apathy that the government can\\'t or won\\'t fix what\\'s broken, that in the corridors of power of London and Edinburgh, they just don\\'t give a shit about Glasgow, especially Glasgow\\'s east side.\\n\\nLike most cities, like most cities, in fact, Glasgow is divided.  The river divides the north and south sides.  But the bigger, more tangible divide is between east and west.  The west, things are expected to be, well, nice.  Nice cars, nice families, all the nice stuff that affluence supposedly brings.  East side, that\\'s where you grow up hard, where things are rougher, where you\\'ve got, according to popular legend, to fight to live every day.\\n\\n[21:05:59]  JOHN CARNOCHAN, FORMER DETECTIVE, STRATHCLYDE POLICE:  In Scotland, if you\\'re a young boy in Scotland and you\\'re 9 or 10 and you\\'re coming home from school, a big guy beats you up and you run home to your mum crying, you know what she\\'ll do?  She\\'ll give you a cuddle and then she\\'ll tell you get back there and get him.  Don\\'t let anybody ever do that to you.  That\\'s what we do.  And it makes us dangerous enemies, resourceful enemies, but it also makes us very loyal allies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Detective John Carnochan, 38 years on the job, much of it is murder police on the east side.  He\\'s seen it all.  Confronted with violent hooliganism, the traditional approach has been to get out there, bust some heads, lock up some perpetrators.  But after decades of dealing with generation after generation of violence, much of it gang related, he took a controversial new tactic.  Along with a colleague, he established a new unit within the Strathclyde police called the Violence Reduction Effort and focused their efforts on the social problems that he felt led directly to violent crime.  His peers, unsurprisingly, we dubious.  But as of 2014, Scotland is at a 40 year low of violent crime.  Retired from the force, Carnochan now advices law enforcement around the world.  When in town, though, he likes to come here, typical Scottish fare, mother India, for a lamb curry served in spicy gravy served with traditional non-Scottish bread.\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  I know Glasgow is a traditionally tough town.  I\\'ve always seen it as a warm and welcoming place.  It\\'s always been one of my favorite places in this part of the world to visit.  Do you think the town\\'s reputation is deserved or is this a --\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  Nope.  I mean in terms of labeling the violence, the fights are the fights.  That\\'s there.  But statistically, if you don\\'t live or come from Glasgow, your chances of being a victim of a violent attack in Glasgow is something like .000.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve never, ever, ever felt -- and I\\'ve done a fair amount of stupid behavior here, a fair amount of drinking, a fair amount of putting myself in the sort of situations they advise visitors to a new town not to take.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI\\'ve never felt uncomfortable here.  I could be wrong in that, after a few drinks, I notice that I don\\'t understand anyone.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThey could be making various threats of violence to me at the bar, and I could just be smiling and nodding.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(voice-over):  Indian food is, of course, huge here as it is everywhere in the U.K.  You could venture to guess that the cold, damp weather causes the heart to yearn for food from spicy climates.  But it\\'s more likely it began with the trade routes established by the East India Company in the 17th century, the returning sailors.  And that whole takeover India thing, all I can say is pass the roginhash (ph).\\n\\n(on camera):  So how do you reduce violence?  I mean, traditionally, we would just get more police.  Get out there, crack some skulls, throw some people in jail, and problem solved.\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A good number of Americans probably still believe that very much.  We\\'re very fond of throwing people in prison.  To suggest otherwise would be seen as coddling criminals.  CARNOCHAN:  Absolutely, and it was the same here.  We started to think\\n\\nabout it in an entirely different ways.  Violence is a public health issue.  We all have the capacity for violence.  People at home learn not to be violent.  That\\'s why (INAUDIBLE).  Because things that happen then will affect their whole life course about how they make decisions about themselves and how they judge risk.  No matter how good the police service is, it will just contain and manage the problem.  It won\\'t make it better.\\n\\n[21:10:09]  BOURDAIN:  First of all, it\\'s not what I expect to hear from somebody who spent 30 years with murder police, presumably busting heads and arresting people, that we should hug these bastards more?\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  Yes, absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That we should make them feel like they\\'re worth something. I mean, I get it.  I believe it, absolutely.  But everything you\\'ve been saying is no way to run for office in my country.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  This is going to take a generation.  They go, oh, politicians don\\'t have a generation.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re worried about the newscasts on Monday at 6:00.\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  The headlines, yeah, absolutely.  The truth is we don\\'t have it sorted here, but we\\'re on a journey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what\\'s going right here?  Let\\'s face it, this is one of the most awesome cities anywhere.\\n\\nCARNOCHAN:  People.  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Look, I don\\'t want to give you the impression that Glasgow is an impoverished wasteland filled with violent hooligans and gang members, an impression shared by many candy ass Europeans, for sure, and a reputation that many Glaswegians are only too happy to perpetuate.  Let\\'s face it, Detroit or New Orleans, most American cities make this town look like Club Med by comparison.\\n\\nGlasgow remains the region\\'s noble shit zone.  What I find most endearing in this town is that if you\\'re a native, you\\'re probably an expert at taking the piss, a high-level style of ball-busting that approaches an art form around here.\\n\\n[21:15:30]  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, it\\'s good to be back at work again.  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No one excels more at deflating the pompous, making fun of self-importance, turning even the darkest tragedy into comedy than Glaswegians.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a ballet, fellows.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is, if you can understand the bastards.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This can be a challenge, particularly after a few pints of Heavy or a couple of bottles of Buckfast.\\n\\n(CHEERING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Glasgow has a reputation of being a hard drinking, two-fisted town.\\n\\nJAMIE GODLEY, GLASGOW RESIDENT & COMEDIAN:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve always found it to be this funny --\\n\\nGODLEY:  Very funny.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- very funny town.  I mean --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nGODLEY:  Very dark humor.  If you say in America, my father died, people are immediately sympathetic.  In Glasgow, if you say it here, Glaswegians say, what size was his shoes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWe have that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Jamie Godley grew up on the east end, married into an organized crime dynasty, worked as a bartender, became a very famous playwright, author, and stand-up comedian.  I thought I\\'d meet her here, at Rogano\\'s, a very old-school institution.\\n\\nJamie\\'s working some goat cheese thing with figs.  For me, Scottish oysters are an irresistible impulse.  They are magnificent, by the way.\\n\\nGODLEY:  What a lot of people abroad don\\'t understand is wine is the backbone of the industry.  That still exists, tony.  The age expectancy is still 55.  In Iraq, it is still 65.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Wow, that\\'s still an extraordinary thing.\\n\\nGODLEY:  Yeah, I know.  There\\'s still a lot of crime.  There\\'s still drugs.  There\\'s still a lot of alcohol problems.  I think the fact that we are a bit shit helps us because we have the commonwealth games here and I loved that everybody tried not to shout in the street and swear and sell stolen goods in public.  I loved that they all had this covert operation of let\\'s be nice for a week.  I loved that.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Main course, Jamie goes for the pan-fried grill.\\n\\nMe?  I can\\'t pass up an ocean-line, continental class from days gone by, like the fabulously unfashionable Tyrannosaurus Rex, the seafood dish, lobster thermidor.  Without irony, the lobster is Scottish, as is the cheese, the eggs, everything really.\\n\\n(on camera):  Do you have anything to say on the Glaswegian diet?\\n\\nGODLEY:  The diet, it\\'s really interesting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, the story is that the health-wise, as far as heart problems, right behind Tonga.\\n\\nGODLEY:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The all-time worse, least healthy --\\n\\nGODLEY:  Yeah.  It\\'s really weird because when I was a kid and we were poorer, we ate fish, butter beans, potatoes.  Then we would have liver and onions and potatoes and cabbage and peas.  Then somewhere from the mid \\'70s onward onwards, it just became crap.  Now you have a generation of women who don\\'t know how to make a pot of soup.  To be a real Glaswegian housewife, you have to be able to make a pot of soup. I can\\'t make soup.  The joke is I\\'m apparently good at sex.  Sex takes five minutes.  Soup can takes days.  And my husband has never asked for soup.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s a terrific music scene in Glasgow. The pubs are among the finest anywhere.  They say Glaswegians have more fun at a funeral than people in Edinburgh have at a wedding. That does invite, from time to time, a fair amount of knuckle-headed behaviors.  If you\\'re looking for a beer and a beating, Glasgow will happily provide it.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\n[21:20:11]  BOURDAIN:  The toughness thing is no joke.  If you ever tried to choke a small Glaswegian into unconsciousness, as I have -- long story -- let me tell you, it is like wrestling with an angry fire plug.  It\\'s nearly impossible.  Also it hurts.\\n\\nAccess to guns is extremely difficult here.  So Scottish hoodlums, unable to dispatch their victims with the kind of speed and efficiently as we enjoy in the good old USA, this led traditionally to resort to the knife to do its maiming and killing.  The old-country way, one person at a time.\\n\\nMARK DAVIES, OWNER, TACTICAL EDGE:  A stabbing might not get more than a few lines down in a column in the Glasgow papers, because in this city, ordinary stabbing is hardly news anymore.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where knife violence is an affliction, there must be a cure.  Meet Mark Davis.  He began his career working as a bouncer in some of the east side\\'s toughest drinking establishments where he had plenty of opportunities to hone his skill.  Now he runs Tactical Edge, teaching close combat and knife defense to U.K. special operators and security companies.  Come at him with a knife, the overwhelming likelihood is that it will soon be hanging out of your ass.\\n\\n(on camera):  Generally, these courses start, come at me with a knife and a guy comes at you like it is \"Friday 13th.\"\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDAVIES:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And pretty much nobody outside of \"Friday 13th,\" in my experience, has ever come at anybody like this.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIf somebody does come, they\\'re rushing at you with multiple --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- in a manic frenzy of multiple jabbing or slashing movements.\\n\\nDAVIES:  Yes.  Your attacker has been affected by adrenaline.  In such a state, the fore brain shuts down.  So you\\'re no longer capable of cognitive thought.  You tend to get these repeated lines of attack. If they\\'re going for the stomach, it is a sewing machine kind of action.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is your first order of business deflecting or getting the knife away from them?\\n\\nDAVIES:  I\\'m going to either gain control of the weapon or go to a returning blade technique where I can control the weapon and return it to sender.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Show me.\\n\\nDAVIES:  OK.  The thing about knife defense is there\\'s no magic bullet.  Any technique can fail.  Any technique can go wrong.  If there\\'s multiple opponents, that can get difficult as well.  Here, this sort of thing, yeah?  If we\\'ve got the knife held up close, OK, yeah, pull hit.  Now I\\'m going to force this thing back into your sternum repeatedly like I\\'m a woodpecker.  Put your hands up, brute force, forth, charge.  That\\'s it.  Charge.\\n\\nSo if you\\'re mugging, I\\'m going to pin your hand to me so I own the weapon and I\\'m going to slap backwards into the groin.  I\\'m going to hit, come up, grab.  Now I\\'m going to introduce point \"A\" with point \"B.\"  When I do that a few times, it\\'s like taking (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nYou\\'re going to want to let go, so bang, bang, bang, bang.\\n\\nThis is a little bit more closer and sort of vicious.  Everybody doesn\\'t see it.  I\\'ve cleared the weapon.  Shift yourself, knee him in the balls, straight under.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That was an education.\\n\\nDAVIES:  No problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I enjoyed that.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[21:23:27]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Last night, in Glasgow, I had enough with the deeper issues.  Now I want to go no deeper than the bottom of a bubbling cauldron of hot grease.  It\\'s out there.  It\\'s calling to me.  I want it now.  A happy place from my past where once I frolicked young and carefree in the field of frialated arts.  The University Cafe where I learned at the foot of the masters the Tao of hot fat and crispy batter.  Yes, they do a deep-fried Mars bar here and deep-fried pizza.  Been there, done that.  But Carlo here and his twin brother have been keeping the Verragio family tradition alive since 1918, and it ain\\'t about no Mars bar.\\n\\n(on camera):  I\\'m tempted to go completely nuts for all the things I like, like pies, beans, and chips.  I don\\'t even know what kind of pie, but I want it.  The macaroni and cheese is tempting.  Haggis I\\'m doing.  I couldn\\'t resist that.  Cheese Beano, I don\\'t know what that is, but I kind of want it.\\n\\nOoh, sausage roll.  I do like a good sausage.\\n\\n[21:30:00]  (voice-over):  I order the fish and chips and some haggis. Haddock battered and floating, a drift in a sea of mysterious life- giving oil.  The accumulated flavors of many magical things as it bobs like Noah\\'s Ark bringing life in all its infinite variety.  Deep-fired Haggis, my personal favorite.  Sinister sheep parts in tube form, in this case.  And if you don\\'t like chopped-up liver and lungs and all that good stuff, believe me, the curry sauce sets you right.  The combination of French fries, or chips in the local dialect, with curry sauce and with cheese is perhaps a bro too far, Guy Fieri (ph) in a kilt, but, what the hey.\\n\\n(on camera):  I\\'m pretty sure God is against this.  Oh, yeah, definitely.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.  Doesn\\'t eat well with a fork.  You really have to pick this up.  I\\'m so ashamed.\\n\\nOh, yeah.  Clean living.\\n\\nThat\\'s really one of life\\'s great pleasures.  Don\\'t let them tell you otherwise.\\n\\nThey\\'re lying about you, Mr. Haggis.\\n\\nThere is no more reviled food on earth than haggis.  Its ingredients are, in fact, no more unusual or bizarre or unappetizing than any hot dog you ever ate.  How many anal glands are in a chicken nugget?  I don\\'t know, and I\\'m not suggesting there are anal glands in a chicken nugget, but would you be surprised if there were?  We\\'ll get to the bottom of this.  Back to you, Wolf.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:45]  BOURDAIN:  Heading north out of Glasgow, Scotland quickly becomes something else.  A savagely beautiful, harsh, but absolutely mesmerizing landscape that seems to have changed not at all for thousands, even millions of years.  And across Loch Mare, and only accessible by boat, one of the great isolated estates: Letterewe. It\\'s the favorite retreat of my friend, Adrian Gill, more widely known as A.A. Gill.  He\\'s the much feared and widely followed restaurant critic for the \"London Sunday Times,\" a regular columnist for a spectrum of magazines, author, traveler, and one of the finest essayists of our time.\\n\\nLetterewe, as it stands today, was built as a shooting lodge.  Deer stalking, like they do here, is something from another era, but it persists in places like this, which both protect and cull deer populations.\\n\\nIf you are, like us, of course, two murderous aristocrats looking to put some venison on the table, you need help, professional help.  And estates like Letterewe come with a stalker.\\n\\nStephen Miller has been working here for eight seasons now, both protecting the animals who live on it and helping people like us in the arduous and delicate task of sneaking up on them.\\n\\nWe would, as gentlemen of leisure, require a cook.  And Adrian has recommended the supremely well-suited Fiona Cullina (ph), who excels at this kind of Scottish traditional game cookery.\\n\\nFor dinner, it\\'s grouse.  Shot, then hung until the already funky game bird gets pleasingly ripe.  The birds are rubbed inside and out with salt and pepper, some fresh thyme jammed in the cavity.  Browned in the pan, plenty of butter to baste with.  In traditional game bird cookery of the British Isles, bread sauce is a must.  We don\\'t do this in America, but here, it\\'s essential.  Basically, it\\'s milk simmered with flavoring agent, like an onion, nutmeg and bay leaf, and then thickened with raspings of bread.  Grouse larded with bacon, then roasted in the oven.  Nicely rare or medium rare, they are moved to rest and the pan deglazed with red wine.  Game stock is added and the sauce reduced.  Topped with watercress along side some parsnips and beet root.\\n\\n(on camera):  So explain what we\\'re eating, because this is as classic as it gets?\\n\\nA.A. GILL, AUTHOR:  This is specifically Scottish.  This is a grouse, which is the only truly wild game bird in Britain.  They\\'re the most highly prized as a sporting bird.  They\\'re the most difficult to shoot, but more importantly, they\\'re the most prized to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This bread sauce thing, what is that?\\n\\nGILL:  Bread sauce, you have to grow up here to love this.  It is like pottage.  It\\'s soft.  It\\'s a very old dish, but it goes very well with -- grouse, they\\'re a very gamey meat.  It\\'s a very grown-up taste that is slightly repellant, but within that, it is particularly alluring.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGILL:  There is something also sexual about it that people don\\'t often talk about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, right.\\n\\nSo good.\\n\\nGILL:  I\\'m going to a vegetarian school.  My parents sent me to a vegetarian boarding school, and for nine years, the year after I left, I was a vegetarian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nine years as a vegetarian, that\\'s unthinkable to me.\\n\\nGILL:  Then I decided not to be.  I made the decision if I was going to eat meat again, then I had to be prepared to do the whole business.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  You\\'ve got to be accountable.\\n\\n[21:40:08]  GILL:  For all of it.  For all of it.  So I started getting fish with the guts in and then gutting them and then, in the end, someone says, well, come and -- if you\\'re going to eat it, come and kill it.  You go, well, then, I have to do that as well.  And when I started doing it, it was like coming home.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the thing with being on the hill.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (voice-over):  Until the 19th century, the Scottish Highlands were seen by many as a mysterious, hostile and dangerous land, populated, when populated at all, by scary ass barbarians, descendents of the terrifying Picts, tribes so ferocious, so extravagant in their violence and toughness, that even the Roman legions decided not to mess with them, and instead, built a wall, hoping to keep them out and away from civilized society.  Later, hunting estates like this were home to tenant farmers who scratched out a living by growing oats and potatoes.  Owned by landed gentry, by various royals, the Highland clans, McKenzie, McDonald, McLeod, to name a few, later, by newer money, fabulously wealthy foreigners. Today, around half the land in Scotland is owned by fewer than 500 people.\\n\\nIt\\'s an anachronism, dismaying to some, I grant you, but seductive as well.  Because who wouldn\\'t do this, if they could?  Enjoy this kind of rugged solitude from the comfort of a warm, inviting 17th century lodge.  Warm one\\'s legs by the fire, play a little Snooker, enjoy a fine, single malt or two, a substantial game meal, maybe another whiskey perhaps, contemplate the mysteries of the universe under a starry sky, and then to sleep into the arms of  Morpheus, to rise in the morning as bringer of death.\\n\\nStephen and Adrian keep calling it \"the hill,\" but that ain\\'t no hill I\\'ve ever seen.  It\\'s a behemoth, an endless range of behemoths, one mountain giving way to a moor, giving away to another mountain, then more, then more.  There might be a hill somewhere in there but it\\'s probably between mountains after a five-mile up-hill walk.  And though I am, to be modest, in the best shape of my life of late, it\\'s a daunting hike.  The climb gradual, then steep.  The footing ranging from rocky to spongy and wet mile after mile.  Me, trying to look cool, make it seem like this is nothing unusual, but really I\\'m dying.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[21:47:10]  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  We walked the Highlands for hours. Our stalker, Stephen, finally identifies a red stag of suitable age and size, one ready, in the parlance, to be taken off the hill.\\n\\nGetting in a range without scaring him off, however, is another challenge.  We need to circle around the mountain to close the distance.\\n\\nSTEPHEN MILLER, LETTEREWE ESTATE DEER STALKER:  There\\'s not a lot I can do.  Fast and light.  So we go slowly.  Just pretend we\\'re hikers at the moment.  He hasn\\'t got a bobble hat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (on camera):  What?\\n\\nMILLER:  If you put a bobble hat on, the deer think you\\'re a hiker.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCan you see the antlers?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nMILLER:  Get down.  Stay down, stay down.  Dig in nice and steady. Just take your time.\\n\\n(GUNSHOT)\\n\\nMILLER:  That\\'s a nice stag.\\n\\n10 points.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that good?\\n\\nMILLER:  He was never going to get any better.\\n\\nDo you want to use your knife?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\n[21:50:26]  MILLER:  For shooting your first red stag in Scotland, you\\'ll get blooded.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMILLER:  Best if you close your eyes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nOh, OK.\\n\\nMILLER:  And the rule is you have to leave it on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nMILLER:  All day.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You going, chaps?\\n\\n(voice-over):  As getting vehicles up here would be both physical and destructive, they have retained the tradition of using Highland ponies to retrieve the stalked deer.  They are bred to be strong and trained to do this work.  They will likely make it back sooner than we will.\\n\\nMILLER:  Thanks, chaps.  We\\'ll catch you around at some point.\\n\\nSee you.\\n\\nGood boys through.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I thought coming up my legs burning, I can\\'t wait until that nice easy downhill walk back, but as I soon find out, the walk down is even harder.  Knees screaming, face crusted with dry blood, I\\'m looking forward to a warm fire, a strong whiskey and some good country ass cooking.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n[21:56:26]  GILL:  So what do you fancy with the venison?  Stew with wine?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They always marinate juniper and all of that.  Super simple.\\n\\nGILL:  OK.  We\\'ll do that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (voice-over):  The venison is seasoned with salt and pepper and rosemary, seared in duck fat and then into the oven.  A pan sauce made from the fawn, red wine and deep game stock, sweetened with currant jelly and finished with a mellowing nod of whole butter and served with clap shot, basically, mashed turnips and potatoes.\\n\\nMILLER:  That\\'s it.  That\\'s the end of the season.  Usually, the girls will be killing it, and you start killing the girls.  You have to traditionally where the mask, the leather mask --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMILLER:  -- to the stag and you -- and you send them notes beforehand saying I\\'m watching you, I know where you live.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (on camera):  We deserve this.\\n\\nMILLER:  We\\'ve worked for it, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nLiterally, the greatest feat of strength of my entire life.  Never at any time in my entire life have I done anything so remotely physical over a sustained period of time.\\n\\nMILLER:  Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Never.\\n\\nMILLER:  Look how well you\\'ve done.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At no point previously in my life would I have been able to do it.\\n\\nThank you, guys.\\n\\nMILLER:  Here\\'s to the best of health, folks.\\n\\nGILL:  All the best.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nGILL:  Good shot.\\n\\nMILLER:  I say to a place --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMILLER:  -- a safer place for ramblers.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMILLER:  It\\'s a lot safer now that we\\'re not on our land.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[21:59:00]  BOURDAIN:  I came to Scotland this time to shoot an animal in the heart, to take part, to be fully culpable in a practice nearly as old as these hills.  You walk this country stalking an animal across the rocks and wet heather, you feel little has changed from how your distant ancestors must have searched for their food, with a rifle, with a spear, with a club.  I drag my knuckles up a hill and like my ape-like predecessors, return tired, happy and covered in blood.\\n\\nEverything changes.  Nothing changes at all.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN ANCHOR:  (INAUDIBLE) the salary man.  Tokyo\\'s willing cog in an enormous machine requiring long hours, low pay, total dedication.  And sometimes, what\\'s called koroshi, death by overwork.\\n\\nHere in a society of tight spaces and many expectations, the pressure is on to keep up appearances, to do what\\'s expected, to not let the interior life become exterior.\\n\\nBut at night, things are different.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nWhat do you need to know about Tokyo?  Deep, deep waters.\\n\\nThe first time I came here, it was like -- it was a transformative experience.  It was powerful and violent experience.  It was as if -- it was just like taking acid for the first time.  Meaning what do I do now?  I see the whole world in a different way.\\n\\nI often compare the experience of going to Japan for the first time, going to Tokyo for the first time, to what Eric Clapton and Pete Townsend must have gone through, the reigning guitar gods of England, what they must have gone through the week that Jimi Hendrix came to town.\\n\\nYou hear about it, you go see it.  A whole window opens up into a whole new thing.  And you think what does this mean?  What do I have left to say?  What do I do now?\\n\\nWelcome to Tokyo.  You are not invited.  This is the other Tokyo. Twelve-hour flight and I\\'m baked.  No sleep.  Might as well -- must go out.\\n\\nThe Kabukicho District near my hotel has the advantage of being where the subterranean life, the repressed (INAUDIBLE) of the Japanese male and some females, too, comes out to play.\\n\\nJoining me is Japanese film producer and production manager, Maso Sokubel.  Always a good sign when protective chains protect entertainers from the soon to be entertained.  Right?  Prepare yourself for the greatest show in the history of entertainment.\\n\\nI\\'m confused.  What does it all mean?\\n\\nNo.  No, it can\\'t be over.  Not yet.  No.  But yes, yet it is.  With a series of chaste high fives with the hard-working performers.\\n\\nOK, I\\'ve got to tell you.  I\\'ve seen Jimi Hendrix.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve seen Janis Joplin.  I\\'ve seen David Bowie.  Diamond Dogs.  I\\'ve seen Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards in the \"Moon for the Misbegotten,\" directed by Jose Quintero on Broadway.  Considered one of the greatest productions ever in -- this was the greatest show I\\'ve ever seen in my life.\\n\\nIt had it all.  It was the greatest show in the history of entertainment.  I don\\'t understand it.  I\\'m completely confused. There\\'s like 100 people working on that show.  Millions of dollars worth of, like, robots and technology.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do they make money?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, one thing for sure about this area is like part of our business is unspoken, but governed by the Yakuza?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Yakuza.  The fraternal organization prominent in the entertainment and financial services sector, as they say, who is said to supervise things here in Shinjuku.  Principally your arcades, your gambling, Pachinko, adult entertainment, your porn shops and sex clubs, along with other ancillary services.\\n\\nBut how much actual boning is going on in the sex district?  Generally speaking, it\\'s more a field of dreams than the actual act of sex. Hostess cafes, for instance, where a lonely overworked salary man can find the attention of cute seemingly adoring girls who find their every uttering fascinating.\\n\\nSo now hostess bar is -- I just want somebody to tell me I\\'m fantastic.  Oh, you\\'re so interesting.  Your job is interesting.  You are a very sexy man.  I don\\'t care what your wife says.  I think you\\'re really interesting?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Penetration, maybe by a Q-tip in the ear, followed by a personal love spell in this case to make your tea taste better.\\n\\nWhat is this place?  What\\'s happening here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are these boys?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Young boyhood club.  Not for man, but for middle- aged ladies who are bored with the regular housewife\\'s life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wait a minute.  You\\'ve got, like, a million guys wandering around here, looking to get -- and they\\'ve got a whole bunch of bored middle-aged housewives coming in here since --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Spending, spending quite a lot of money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why don\\'t they go to the same club and somebody will actually have sex?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People don\\'t like getting rejected, so they sort of like pay for their pleasure.  And they make you feel welcome. Maybe you can feel like hmm, I\\'m not that bad, after talking to those girls or boys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s the saddest thing I\\'ve ever heard.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, that\\'s heartbreaking, dude.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIs the business essentially good dreams?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is more for the dream of dream so, which is never going to happen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  All of this -- I mean, it is a very enticing -- I mean, look at this.  Wait a minute.  She looks like she really likes me.  Look, she\\'s got her tongue tucked up the corner of her mouth.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Who?  Which one?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s a boy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whatever.\\n\\nGolden god.  One of my favorite place to drink in Tokyo.  Hundreds of microsized bars, each different from the other with their own micro crowd.  I love it here.\\n\\nI\\'ve never been here.  Maybe I have.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\nThis place is one of Maso\\'s favorites, Bar Albatross.  He sips strong drinks, the definition of a hole in the wall.\\n\\nNow, do people come from -- come here right from work, drink all night and then go back to work?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Salary man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Salary man?  Would a salary man bring his wife here?  So look, in America, the bartender is like a priest.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So you come and talk to them?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I can tell them all of my problems.  And I could behave very badly and he will never talk, ever.  This is the contract.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Absolute confidentiality.  Do I have that kind of arrangement here now?  So I have this implied guarantee of total security.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if I came here with some dinosaur-riding ho in a bikini --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It would be -- no, no, you don\\'t have to ask.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nOh, man.  This is a great country.  Every chef I know wants to die here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is that about the food?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Because the food is awesome.  And because we -- I think all of us understand that we don\\'t understand anything about Japan.  And I totally don\\'t understand the porn here.  Why is it OK -- you can\\'t -- somebody with a penis but you can with an octopus tentacle?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In Japan, there\\'s a very old, very deep, and very rich tradition of martial arts.  Many styles, many schools.  The Yonekura Gym and toshima war focuses on boxing.  And this man, Kenji Yonekura, is a legend, having trained generations of fighters using a simple and effective philosophy that has some real application to our story. There it is pasted on the wall behind the ring.  One, speed.  Two, timing.  Three, distance.\\n\\nThe same idea applies to the convention-shunning sushi techniques of New York City legend Naomichi Yasuda.  Until recently, the chef partner of one of the very best, if not the best sushi restaurant in New York.  The Apotomese Sushi Yasuda.  A short while ago, under very mysterious and completely misreported circumstances, he left the Manhattan restaurant which still bears his name.  And at age 52 moved to Tokyo to start all over again.\\n\\nI was determined to track him down and see what the hell he was doing. These days, this great man is running a 14-seat sushi bar in the Minatu district of Tokyo.  His wife Naomi is his only helper.\\n\\nNAOMICHI YASUDA, CHEF:  Welcome to the place.  Thank you for coming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why did you do such a hard thing?\\n\\nYASUDA:  This city, Tokyo, this is kind of the maker of the sushi.  So I just want to be the sushi chef in Tokyo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yasuda is a friend, and my master in the sense that he\\'s taught me pretty much everything I know about sushi over the years. He\\'s a very, very interesting and complex man who constantly surprises.\\n\\nYASUDA:  This is the most expensive wasabi.  So I wait, wait, wait. Finally, then this one goes to discount box.  Then I bought this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s very French of you.\\n\\nSo many things separate Yasuda-san from other Japanese sushi masters. The most noticeable is his hands.  They\\'re huge.  Look at the knuckles.  Enormous from years of pounding cement walls during repeated daily practice in Kyokushin karate.  He first trained and competed in Tokyo.  When he came to New York, he continued to practice.  Often in underground, bare-knuckle matches, you fight until someone gets beaten to the ground.\\n\\nThis style Yasuda practiced was about beating your opponent as quickly and as aggressively as possible.  Speed.  Every second is important. The rice is getting cold, the seaweed is getting soggy, fish, less than perfect temperature.\\n\\nLook at his posture.  A fighter\\'s stance.  Distance, knowing the perfect spot to be.  Moving in and out as needed.  Never out of position.  Timing.  Reacting to his customer\\'s pace of eating, their ever-changing desires, always ready for the next move.\\n\\nMost people who don\\'t understand sushi will go to a sushi bar and say oh, I had the best sushi last night.  The fish was so fresh.  It was right out of the ocean.\\n\\nYASUDA:  The freshest fish, there is no taste.  Just chewing, just hard.  And people think freshest should be good.  But it wasn\\'t.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yasuda\\'s menu changes constantly with what he finds in the market.  And like thousands of other sushi chefs, he heads every day to Tsukiji, Tokyo\\'s central fish market, where nearly 3,000 tons of the world\\'s best seafood arrives every day.  But unlike most others at his level who arrive at 4:00 a.m. to cream off what they perceive as the best and freshest, Yasuda-san arrives later.  He does not buy the ridiculously expensive otoro, the fatty belly meat of the blue fin tuna that people have been known to pay hundreds of dollars a pound for.\\n\\nInstead, he buys tuna from the heads, using his knife skills to go for qualities that most others miss, removing every bit of sinew from what would otherwise be a difficult piece of meat.  In total, it\\'s, well, perfect.  And he cures the results.  Actually cures it.  Breaking down its molecular structure in a desirable way by freezing it quickly in a medical grade blast freezer where it will stay for a week or longer in minus 82 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nHe pioneered this technique years ago in New York where if you bothered to ask, he would have proudly told you that the absolutely unbelievably sublime piece of perfect sushi you were eating was frozen.\\n\\nDelicious.\\n\\nYASUDA:  Thank you very much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is more important, the rice or the fish?  Or what percentage?  Rice.  More important?\\n\\nYASUDA:  About 90 percent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nYASUDA:  Fish is the second ingredient.  The main ingredient is rice. So my sushi is rice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yasuda, he still trains, though his fighting days are over. He says he was tired of hurting people.  He brings me to (INAUDIBLE) in (INAUDIBLE), to try and show me how his sushi technique and Kyokushin karate are one in the same.\\n\\nYuki Kamio, the master.  Nice.\\n\\nYASUDA:  People ask me, what\\'s the point between the karate and the sushi?  But this moment is so much good for when I make my sushi. Because of the stance.  The stance is more upper.  So this karate stance is more deep.  So stand in front of the cutting board, a little bit of a deep stance and movement.\\n\\nDeep stance and body, move this, and the watch, through the (INAUDIBLE) from left to the right.  Right (INAUDIBLE).  Move this, move this.  Watch this and watch this.  This is the key.  So this karate is my sushi stance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now in an official tournament, two-minute rounds.\\n\\nYASUDA:  Two-minute round.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And the result you are looking for is points?\\n\\nYASUDA:  Points or knockdown.  But two minutes fight.  One minutes fight.  That\\'s most hardest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s underground.  You can just work on their legs for five, seven minutes to slow them down.  Then you go in.\\n\\nYASUDA:  Yes.  And not compromise.  Just do it.  Whatever happen, no excuse.  See the result good or not.  If it\\'s bad, try again.  Don\\'t give up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYASUDA:  This is my sushi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Perfect.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN:  Those who buy into the notion of Japanese women as shy, giggling, subservient victims of convention would be confused by Tamika.  People, as everywhere, if you look deeper, can surprise you.\\n\\nHer day job is doing this.  And I gather from what she tells me that she gets plenty of work.\\n\\nThe Taito ward of Tokyo, another complicated warren of businesses layer upon later where excellent Ezekias were well represented. Places where a hardworking salary man could have a beer and some sake, or many beers and many sakes.  And salty, savory, pick-me delicious snacks that go brilliantly with alcohol.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nTamika brings me to one of them, Daitoro, to meet some friends. Kusaia, followed by secures of beef intestine and chicken.  This place is known for its motsunabe, intestine stew with mizo.  So we ordered some of that as well.\\n\\nThis is Naga, invited along to translate.  Naga runs a customs service company but he also teaches pole dancing for men.  Then there\\'s this man, Kinoko Hajime, one of the best known and most respected practitioners, a master of shibari, the art of ropes of beautiful knots, of what, for lack of a better word, we call bondage.\\n\\nSo how big is the sadomasochistic community?  How many people are active participants?\\n\\nNAGA, TRANSLATOR:  Hundred thousand people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot?\\n\\nNAGA:  A lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is shibari.  Translation, to buy.  It makes things more confusing for those looking for a concise takeaway of comfortable reaction to what sure as hell looks pretty disturbing.  Tomika, who spends most of her time ripping, burning, and generally abusing men, enthusiastically reverses roles in her longtime relationship with Hajime.\\n\\nIt looks like a very delicate procedure.  Does it hurt?  Or does it feel good?\\n\\nNAGA:  This pain change to the excesses.  She said when she was tied up, no need to think.  Just leave it.  She loved it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Performance art, craft, fetish, or compulsion.  It\\'s an old and shockingly omnipresent feature of Japanese popular fantasy culture.  Magazines, movies, even comic books.  The intricate restraint of a willing victim is -- well, it\\'s there.  Not far from the surface.\\n\\nWhat percentage of Japanese men are interested in either tying up women or subjugating?  NAGA:  All of them?  All of them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, then the question is how many Japanese men like to be tied up?\\n\\nNAGA:  All of them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So in your experience, all Japanese men like to tie women up, but in your experience, all Japanese men like to be tied up. Who\\'s more -- sexually, Americans or Japanese?\\n\\nNAGA:  Same.\\n\\nMaybe she says you need to be tied up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A little late for me.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In America, where I come from, we are told at a certain age to put aside childish things.  The action figures, dolls, features of our imaginations, to arm ourselves with the brutal realities of the real world, real combat, real sex.\\n\\nIn Japan, increasing numbers of people don\\'t.  They continue to live a life inside four walls, inside their mind, the life we call the computer geek, the nerd, as avatars.\\n\\nThere\\'s a name for it, a whole subculture of what\\'s called otaku. Once a derisive term, now a proud identifier of the geek, one who has turned his back on the real world and finds satisfaction elsewhere.\\n\\nManga, or comic books, hold a different place in the cultural landscape here and address different needs.  There\\'s Yaoi, for example, otherwise known as boys love manga, extremely popular with teenage girls.\\n\\nStories change, but the core themes are sexually ambiguous boys getting very friendly with each other.  What legions of young girls and soccer moms find compelling in the thousands of these titles, something of a mystery to outsiders looking in, but there they are. Whole sections of manga book shops dedicated to basically one direction type boy band figures having sex with each other.\\n\\nYaoi isn\\'t generally explicit, though it can be.  Some of the most popular manga are, however, lurid, over-the-top illustrated stories of incredible violence, rape, murder, and sexual fetishes.\\n\\nToshio Maeda is a manga creator like few others, the father of what could only be described as tentacle porn.  His 1986 manga \"Urotsukidoji,\" was about half-human, half-bestial space invaders in search of an evil supreme being.  It contained unbelievably graphic, lurid, violent, and one would argue offensive images of sex acts involving not sexual organs, but other protuberances.\\n\\nIt became a huge hit and has been imitated wildly both in other manga and other live action films.  A whole genre of lurid, but extraordinarily well-drawn madness.  At Meino Uli (ph) restaurant Toshio tries to explain.\\n\\nTOSHIO MAEDA, MANGA CREATOR:  This girl seems like a high school girl. So basically, it\\'s forbidden.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Notice, by the way, the distinguished owner and her complete lack of shock or offense at the graphic, frankly horrifying images of rape, violation, and murder spread casually across the table for all to see.\\n\\nJapanese manga, ones that everyone reads on the subway home even, well, they\\'re different.\\n\\nThe big breakthrough was you couldn\\'t draw penises, you couldn\\'t draw specifically orifices.  You couldn\\'t actually show humans penetrating each other.\\n\\nMAEDA:  In Japan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMAEDA:  It was a big no-no at that time.  So I invented tentacles.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMAEDA:  To be evasive about the law.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Also demons.\\n\\nMAEDA:  Demons.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Demons.  That\\'s fantastic.  Whether you meant to at the time, you absolutely changed the world of manga.  You created an entire spectrum of pornography that didn\\'t exist before.  I mean, if you go -- if you go to YouTube now, there is tentacle manga.  There -- tentacle and demon manga.  There is tentacle and demon anime.  A lot.\\n\\nThat looks good.\\n\\nFor dinner, there\\'s katsuono tataki (ph), fresh bonito seared quickly over flame, arranged in bite-sized pieces, garnished with daikon (ph), fresh greens, sprouts and ponzu.\\n\\nToshio comes here often to the Tomato Nabe, commonly a favorite of sumo wrestlers as part of a weight gain diet.  Basically it\\'s a hot pot of meat and vegetables.  Chicken, pork, beef, fish bowls keep getting fed into the pot.  Usually alongside much beer and rice. Adding that much needed (INAUDIBLE) factor so important to sumo wrestlers and cable TV hosts.\\n\\nSo appealing to the human desires of a manga-buying audience, men want filthier, dirtier, more violent?\\n\\nMAEDA:  In Japan, you can\\'t be rude in public.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMAEDA:  But you need to just, you know, I can say that letting off steam.  So for me, the manga is one way to do that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do women want?  Generally speaking, what do women want in manga?\\n\\nMAEDA:  Yaoi.  Boys.  You know.  Because they don\\'t have enough experience to do that with real men.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But nobody\\'s going to the fish market and asking for live octopus.  Probably not.\\n\\nMAEDA:  Probably not.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The pop music scene in Tokyo is not that different than ours.  With an accent, though, on pretty boy bands, pop idols, tween stars.  Generic, industry-created crap, for the most part.  Like I said, not so different than us.\\n\\nPicture an army of Miley Cyruses, or would that be Miley Cy-rai (ph)? Going against the grain are a few lone heroes like (INAUDIBLE).  Two self-released albums and no hint of a record deal.  Damn suits.  What do they know?\\n\\nLead singer Yu.  Sweet, shy, pop friendly, (INAUDIBLE) fair?  No.\\n\\nSo yes, so how big an audience in Japan for thrash metal, death metal, hardcore?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We had Ozzy Osbourne contest this year.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For the first time in Japan.  And I feel like people are seeing the heavy metal scene as a new movement.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And the audiences?  Good audiences here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They are kind of polite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Polite.  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Really quiet and just watching us.  And when we finish playing, they suddenly clap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  You know, when I look at popular music, the stuff that\\'s selling millions of records in America, it makes me angry, actually.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You mean, that you sometimes you\\'re angry (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, if I see Nickelback, I want to kill myself.  OK.  I want to kill them, and then I want to kill myself.  And then I want to kill everybody who listens to them.  OK?  What\\'s so funny?  It\\'s true. I mean, who do you hate?  What band do you hate?  What -- a band that I would know.  Who\\'s the worst band in the world?  The worst popular band in the world?  Who?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, My Chemical Romance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My Chemical Romans, yes.  Hate them.  That\\'s a good one. Can you make a living?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not at all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not at all?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We all have part-time jobs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You all have jobs.  What do your families think when they see that you\\'re doing this kind of music?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are 22 to 25 years old.  It\\'s the hunting job season.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So there\\'s pressure on you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  I mean, we all went to university.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And we have enough money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The expectation, the pressure is OK, get a real job.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Put aside this record well shit and get a real job.  In a perfect world would you like to play rock and roll every night?  Would you like to play metal every night?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  I can be a (INAUDIBLE), if I could keep doing this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Can you?  Yes, these guys look like lifers.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tokyo may well be the most amazing food city in the world. With a nearly unimaginable variety of places stacked one on top of the other, tucked away on every level of densely packed city streets.\\n\\nAt Lawson\\'s, you can dig into their unnaturally fluffy, insanely delicious, incongruously addictive egg salad sandwiches.  I love them. Layer after layer after layer of awesome.  Proud eateries serving who knows what.  But it all smells delicious and looks enticing.\\n\\nIn the tiny almost micro-neighborhood of Nakamaguro, Tokyo, all is quiet.  And amazingly from right here in the middle of this pinball machine of a city, green.  Yasuda lives near here.  And he loves this place.  A low-key joint to enjoy family meals and meet friends.\\n\\nYASUDA:  I so much appreciate I see you and all of the people from the U.S.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, we miss you.  You know?\\n\\nYASUDA:  I miss New York City.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll tell you something really terrible.  Every relationship I\\'ve ever had with a woman, at some point very early on I bring them to Yasuda in New York.  And I would watch how they eat.  If they talk too much, if they didn\\'t understand how to eat sushi, if they did not eat the huni, we will never have a relationship.  That\\'s it.  That\\'s the end.\\n\\nThey don\\'t serve high end sushi here or elaborate (INAUDIBLE) inspired fare.  It\\'s almost like hipster tempura.  This style of food is known as kushiagei.  Skewers of delicious things dipped in batter and fried. Perfect.  Yasuda-san orders up shrimp and basil, (INAUDIBLE) fruit, octopus, and pickled quail eggs.\\n\\nWe also have to have their take on okonomiyaki, a type of egg batter pancake that can filled with many things.  For us it\\'s squid and brushed with Worcestershire sauce.\\n\\nWow.  That\\'s awesome.  I\\'ve been coming here for many times, but this is the first time to eat this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okonomiyaki.  Yes.  Love this dish.  You lived in New York, what, 14 years?  Eighteen years?\\n\\nYASUDA:  Twenty-seven years.  So since 1984.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Twenty-seven years in New York.  That changes a person.\\n\\nYASUDA:  Very much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re a New Yorker now.\\n\\nYASUDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was the hardest thing to get used to when you first came here?\\n\\nYASUDA:  Culture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The culture.\\n\\nYASUDA:  The culture is so much different in the U.S. and here.  And so interesting always.  I never, ever get bored in that city.  BOURDAIN:  I never get bored and I always learn new things in\\n\\nManhattan.  But there\\'s 15, 20 different Manhattans in Tokyo to me.  I mean, if you -- from my perspective these are completely different cities.  Even building to building.  Nightclub for men, nightclub for girls, nightclub for rock and rollers, hair salon.  All up.  Fifteen different businesses in one building.  One building.\\n\\nI could spend the next five years just doing shows on this one building.\\n\\nWhat is weird?  What is strange?  What do those things even mean, anyway?  Sure a lot of what you\\'ve seen looks different from maybe the mainstream.  It\\'s certainly different from the way we like to portray ourselves, see ourselves, at least our daytime selves.  But roughly 50 percent of all movies rented in American hotel rooms are adult films.\\n\\nThe American porn industry catering to exactly the kind of dark urges we\\'ve been talking about but even nastier is a $12 billion a year industry that dwarves the Hollywood product.  Our own obsessions arguably are at least as crazy, violent, and lurid as Japan\\'s.  And we tend to actually carry out our violent fantasies more frequently.\\n\\nMaybe with that fetishism, that attention to detail comes some kind of excellence in other fields.  Maybe there\\'s a line from there to here. So who\\'s crazy now?\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):Welcome to my place of dreams.  My spirit house.  The city of ghosts.\\n\\n(MUSIC: THEME SONG)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Way in central Vietnam is someplace I\\'ve never been before.  But it\\'s still Vietnam, where all the things, the smells, the sounds, the details, I love so much.  First night in country, it\\'s like sliding into a warm, deeply comforting familiar bath.\\n\\nI\\'ve been all over Vietnam, a place I feel a special connection to. My first love, a place I remain besotted with, fascinated by.\\n\\n(on camera):  So back in Vietnam, one of my favorite places on earth. And all of the things I need for happiness.  Little plastic stool, check.  Tiny little plastic table, check.  Ooh.  Something delicious in a bowl.  Check.\\n\\n(voice-over):  In this case a local specialty, tom hen (ph), clam rice, sweet, meaty little local clams out of their shells, tossed with a wild swirl of mung beans, white rice, spicy green chilis, crunchy roasted peanuts, fried pork rind, and cilantro.  And a similar variation with rice noodles.\\n\\n(on camera):  That fish sauce with chilies in it, and oh, that\\'ll just singe your eyebrows off.  Some chilies in.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Hit with some hot clam broth, and you\\'re on your way. I\\'m back.  Back in Vietnam.  Shit-eating grin for the duration.  A giddy, silly, foolish man beyond caring.\\n\\n(on camera):  And a cold local beer.  My preferred brand, in every way.  Ah.  Clams with pork cracklings.  How could that not be good?\\n\\nThis is the way so many of the great meals of my life have been enjoyed.  Sitting in the street, eating something out of a bowl that I\\'m not exactly sure what it is.  Scooters going by.  So delicious.  I feel like an animal.  Where have you been all my life?\\n\\nFellow travelers, this is what you want.  This is what you need.  This is the path to true happiness and wisdom.\\n\\n(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Located on the north and south banks of the Perfume River in central Vietnam, mountains behind, sea ahead, an arrangement determined by criteria both military and spiritual.  For 143 years, Hue was the seat of power for the Nguyen dynasty, which ruled the entire country until the late 1800s, when the French started taking power and land under their control.\\n\\nThe French allowed the imperial throne to rule nominally the center of the country, until the end of World War II in 1945.  Hue has been celebrated for its dynastic architecture since the early 1800s, vast palaces, pagodas, and tombs.  The center, as well, for the intellectual, artistic, culinary and religious life of the country.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh yes, that\\'s tempting.  It\\'s around here somewhere.\\n\\n(voice-over):  This is Dong Ba market, and deep inside, somewhere in there, is what I want.\\n\\n(on camera):  My way of thinking, in the hierarchy of delicious, slurpy stuff in a bowl, Bun Bo Hue is at the very top.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Nguyen Qui Duc is an author and journalist who spent much of his childhood in Hue.\\n\\nNGUYEN QUI DUC, AUTHOR/JOURNALIST:  If I\\'m going to die, I\\'m going to go to prison, they give me a last meal, this will be it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This will be it.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  This will be it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s do it, man.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Here Kim Shao (ph) creates an elaborate broth of mixed bones scented with lemongrass, spice, and fermented shrimp paste.  At the bottom, rice noodles garnished -- nay, heaped -- with tender slow- cooked beef shank, crab meat dumplings, pig\\'s foot, and huyet, blood cake.  Garnished with lime wedge, cilantro, green onions, chili sauce, shredded banana blossoms and mung bean sprouts, it\\'s a wonder of flavor and texture.  The greatest soup in the world.\\n\\n(on camera):  Look at that, man, that is just unbelievable.  Blood cake.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  Blood cake.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The sauce.  I want to see how much he put in there.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  You\\'ve got to make it look really red in there.  It has to be blood red.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And the broth is wonderful.  People are put on earth for various purposes, I was put on earth to do this.  Eat noodles right here.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  When I was a kid, we used to tell each other, do not take a date to go out to eat this stuff, because if you start sweating, your hair will stick up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  I would definitely bring a date to this, because if she doesn\\'t like this, there\\'s no hope of a relationship.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If she said, \"Oh, I don\\'t know, there\\'s, like, blood. There\\'s icky stuff in there,\" that would be a relationship ender to me.  I mean, I\\'m not kidding.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  I mean, here you are having it in a market like this.  She makes this in a place like New York or Paris, it would be real cuisine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s just -- I mean, this is as sophisticated and complex a bowl of food as any French restaurant.  It really is the -- just the top of the mountain.\\n\\nHow long has she been here?\\n\\nNGUYEN:  She started out when she was 12.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You live in a great country, man.  Any country that could produce this is a superpower, as far I\\'m concerned.\\n\\nI\\'m getting down to, like, the pepper residue at the bottom.  How long does that broth have to simmer to get good?\\n\\nNGUYEN:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nNGUYEN:  An hour.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, really?  I would have guessed, like, 14 hours.\\n\\nYum.  Happy.  Nice burny feeling on my lips, flop sweat, check. Happy.  So, we can pretty much cancel the rest of the show.  I\\'ve achieved the -- my happy zone.  It\\'s really all downhill from here.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  My oldest friend in Vietnam, Lin (ph). Originally assigned to translate, to guide, to escort, and to report on me back in 2000 when I first came to this country.\\n\\n(on camera):  How are you, brother?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My brother.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good to see you.\\n\\n(voice-over):  His responsibilities to his employers have never been an impediment to our friendship.  We meet in Zui Yan (ph), where you pick your own seafood out of the tank and you cook it yourself.\\n\\n(on camera):  You really do look exactly the same.  You look good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You also look the same.  No trace of time on your face.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My hair is white.  I have the pictures.  I looked completely different in 2000.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People told me that all the seafood is from the lagoon over here.  Tam Giang (ph).  Tam Giang (ph) lagoon is one of the biggest ones in southeast Asia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I\\'m going for some eel.  Season with lemon grass, green chili and pepper, drizzle with house special sauce, grill over charcoal and dig in.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have the picture with you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You have some old photos?  Oh, look at me, come on.  I look like my Aunt Sonia.  Look at this.  I look like I\\'m 30 years younger.  And that\\'s...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My son, Ming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ming?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He\\'s now 17.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh my God, he\\'s going to college soon.  Wow.  This is the island of Mr. Sang.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  From Cho Island.  In Halong Bay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hanoi.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hanoi, by the West Lake (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh my God, look at that.  We look cool.  We totally look cool here.\\n\\nBut does everybody fall in love with the country like I did?  I came here, and it stole my heart.  You know?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s a very good meeting point between Vietnam (ph) and America.  But in the past, it was over, and now is a new time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm.  Wow, that\\'s great.  Dude, that\\'s pretty spicy. Perfect with beer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We need more drinks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Lobster from the South China Sea.  Give it a nice haircut tableside, and it\\'s perfect.\\n\\n(on camera):  Mm, sweet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sweet?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sweet, just like I remember.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  A sentimental guy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sometimes at work I try to be serious, and I just think about work, but I don\\'t know why.  When I meet you, I just think about drinking and getting something good to eat.\\n\\nOne more cheer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good to see you again, my friend.\\n\\n(voice-over) It\\'s been a long time since my old friend and I met.  A hell of a lot of road with this guy.\\n\\nOne of the great joys of life is riding a scooter through Vietnam.\\n\\nTo be part of this mysterious, thrilling, beautiful choreography. Thousands upon thousands of people -- families, friends, lovers -- each an individual story glimpsed for a second or two in passing, sliding alongside, pouring like a torrent through the city.  A flowing, gorgeous thing.\\n\\nAs you ride, you not only see but overhear a hundred intimate moments in miniature.  You smell wonderful, unnamed things cooking, issuing from store fronts and food stalls.  The sounds of beeping, laughing. Announcements from speakers, the putt-putt and roar of a million tiny engines.\\n\\nHue\\'s place in history, long regarded as the heart of the Imperial Dynasty, changed forever during the Vietnam War.  In 1968, Hue became the site of some of the most bitter fighting in the war.\\n\\nDuring the lunar new year, the Tet holidays, when usually there was a cessation of hostilities, more than 100 cities all over South Vietnam were attacked by the North Vietnamese and V.C.  Hue quickly fell.\\n\\nYou have seen these images.  It was footage like this that turned, finally, a great part of the American public against the war.  The U.S. Marines fought house to house to retake the city.  A vicious three-and-a-half-week-long battle.  Eventually, artillery and air support were called in.  The city was saved.  And of course, largely destroyed in the saving.\\n\\nThe civilian population caught in the crossfire were equally devastated.  The North Vietnamese, to their enduring shame, had while controlling the city, rounded up anyone seen as a potential enemy and either disappeared them away to unknown prisons or killed them outright.  Most notoriously when they massacred almost 3,000 people, rolling them, many of them still alive into mass graves in and around Hue.\\n\\nDuc knows full well the horrors and heartbreak of that time.  In his memoir, \"Where the Ashes Are: The Odyssey of an American Family,\" he captures the terror of a nine-year-old boy, the son of a high-ranking South Vietnamese civil servant, caught up in the nightmare of war.\\n\\n(on camera):  Where were you in 1968?\\n\\nNGUYEN:  I was at the place where it\\'s now a hotel.  My parents were staying there, we were staying there.  We were surrounded during the night.  We didn\\'t even know.  My father looked out the window and just thought it was South Vietnamese soldiers.  Everybody was surprised. In those days, we thought that the war was something happening out in the battlefields and the mountains, out in the countryside, and all of a sudden, we come here, and there\\'s the flag of the National Liberation Front, and to see that was just a complete shock.\\n\\nSo we stayed for a week in the basement, and the American soldiers came.  By that time they had marched my father away, the North Vietnamese soldiers.  We didn\\'t know where he was taken to, and we had no idea whether he was alive or not.  My mother went out to the mass graves, when they were discovered, and she saw the bodies in there. And she said, \"I can\\'t go there and look for him.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of people died here.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  You cannot help thinking about these people who died when they\\'re young, who died for no reason, who just got caught in the fire fights.  We have the day of the dead here, the day of the wandering souls, and we honor those who are not buried within their home village, are not taken care of, their spirits are not taken care of. There are families here who don\\'t have a death date, which is huge.  A death anniversary in the Vietnamese is when you do the ceremonies, you pay attention to the dead.  You can\\'t do that if you don\\'t know when they really died.  You just assume those people are just never liberated, spiritually, that they are stuck in that space.\\n\\nAnd it was like that for my father, because he was in prison; we had no news from him.  You couldn\\'t set up an altar.  You just hoped that he was alive.  Ten, 12, 15 of your friends are going out and doing things.  You would just have this weight on you that your father is somewhere imprisoned or in the jungles.  And that stuff stayed with me for 40 years in my mind.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how many Vietnamese have that kind of experience.  At the same time, I come back to Hue, my hometown, my family\\'s hometown.  I\\'m glad people are alive, people are living, things are happening, things are changing.  We need to let the country open up and let the people have a moment of enjoyment, have a better life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, obviously I\\'m an outsider, but it just seems to me as a casual observer, you can pretty much survive anything.\\n\\nNGUYEN:  oThat\\'s what my brother reminds me, when I used to get all upset about things happening in Vietnam.  He said, \"Look, it survived 4,000 years.  It will do OK.\"  When you ask me to be hopeful, I\\'m hopeful, because it\\'s a young\\n\\ncountry.  It\\'s a young population.  It\\'s energetic and that drives me, that gives me hope that makes me young, that makes me to want believe in this country.  And this town.  Such a wonderful place to be.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Voy Tran (ph) is a painter, and something of a throwback, an anomaly, a creature from another, earlier time in the life of the one-time imperial city.\\n\\nShe lives in an area called Pienan (ph) Hill, in a magnificently restored compound.  These traditional wooden houses were once part of the regal style, with sloped roofs to handle the rainy Hue weather. But most importantly, they feature a garden at the center, which follows the eastern philosophy that all things originate from a single source, and expand in all directions.\\n\\nSince the loss of her beloved son, she\\'s lived here, surrounded by her garden and her art.  Occasionally, she invites guests and friends. There\\'s Duc, writer and food blogger Lan (ph), art collector Jean- Francois Hubert (Ph), and Philippe Damat (ph).\\n\\n(voice-over):  So this is your home; also a gallery?\\n\\nVOY TRAN (PH), PAINTER:  Yes, I design and my people work.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  She also cooks, magnificently from a repertoire of imperial Hue-era dishes numbering over 100.  Back in dynastic times, the emperors demanded variety: in wives, of whom they would sometimes have over 100, and in food.  The menus of the 19th Century imperial palaces boasted new dishes every night.  Small, flavorful, and beautifully presented.  And that culinary tradition, which gave Hue its reputation as a food capital, continues today.\\n\\n(on camera):  How much of that persists?  Those imperial roots, that need for variety?\\n\\nTRAN (ph):  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nNGUYEN:  Yes, the tradition has stayed, and it will stay forever here, to cook all these different things all the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  We start with bird\\'s nest soup, a delicacy to which I am usually immune.  This one is unusually flavorful.  These are swallow\\'s nests from high up on cliffs near Nyet Trang (ph). They\\'re soaked in water, cooked in chicken stock, and served with crab meat.  Lotus seeds, a symbol of purity, nobility and patience, from a nearby lake.  Steamed.  Crab roe is mixed with red onion, pepper, and seasoning and added to the soup.  And simmered.\\n\\nTRAN (voice-over):  The special thing about Hue cuisine is that we use very few spices.  The ingredients are so fresh and good they require very little seasoning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The symbolic and health aspects of many of these dishes not to be overlooked.\\n\\n(on camera):  This is fantastic.  Lovely.\\n\\nHow does Hue differ from the rest of Vietnam?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A wonderful architecture, and very quiet people. If you stay some time in Hue, after some days you feel quiet, you take your time.\\n\\nTRAN:  In Hue, our rivers are in close proximity to the ocean.  And the types of fish living where fresh and salty waters meet.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Goi wei (ph) is a traditional dish that\\'s seldom made these days because of the complexity and the time needed to do it right.  A fish stock is made from kaban (ph), a fish from the Perfume River. Pineapples, onions, chilies, shallots, and coriander.  A salad of quickly cooked prongs, rice noodles, ginger, red chili, garlic and galangao (ph).  Layer of rice noodle, banana flower, then the prongs, garnishes.  The strained fish stock is brought to the table with the salad in separate bowls and combined just before eating.\\n\\nTRAN:  Spicy for you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, it\\'s good.  I love it.\\n\\nTRAN:  It is very spicy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh no, I like it.\\n\\nWhat I found when I first came to the this part of the world, Vietnam in particular.  My pallet changed.  I needed an elevated level of chilies and heat.\\n\\nMuch of Vietnamese cooking abides by principles of yin and yang.  Heat and cold.  This one, a lobster dish with five spices, balances the coldness of the lobster with the heat of the spices.  Red onion, ginger, lemongrass and chilies are added to the boiling water to cook the lobster.  Once the lobster\\'s cooked, it\\'s presented in a bowl of lime leaves.  And the stock is poured over it.\\n\\nWhoa.  That\\'s beautiful.  We\\'re getting into this with our hands, I\\'m guessing.  I like this.  Beautiful.\\n\\nTRAN:  The winter here is unbelievable, it\\'s very cold and wet. That\\'s why we have chili to keep us warm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Voy Tran spoils all of with us a succession of dishes.  But the past, as it often does in a place like this, intrudes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s dealt with a lot of suffering.  The people here are very withdrawn in some ways.  Smiling, but of course they remember everything.  They have to remember the war in 1968.\\n\\nI was visiting my grandfather\\'s house, and I got goose bumps because I knew during the war in 1968 lots of people were killed.  And they were buried on all the sidewalks there.  And I\\'d walk around there and I feel it.  It\\'s dark, it\\'s somber, and the history is there.\\n\\nTRAN:  They say, \"every meter of Hue, there\\'s a dead person.\"  My mom, she never wanted me to go home after like 10:00.  She\\'d get angry if I got home at 11:00 or something.  She scared me, so when I got home at 9:00, I tried to go home very early.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Riding a boat along the river, you sort of feel there are things living in the water and in the trees and in the darkness out there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Know your enemy, they say.  Know who it is you\\'re facing out there.  Who are they?  Why do they fight?  What are they willing to endure in the furtherance of their cause?  These, one would think, are simple questions, useful in any conflict.\\n\\nMeet the enemy.  Okay.  He was only an infant during our nine-year long war, but Quio Tan\\'s (ph) experience should be instructive.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  That year when I was born, 1967, the fighting was very fierce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 1965, the United States initiated a sustained bombing campaign called Rolling Thunder, hoping to destroy an elusive enemy in villages like this one.  Vinh Moc (ph), which was less than 20 miles from forward U.S. Marine fire bases just south of the DMZ.\\n\\nThis is where Tan was born.  As the target of frequent bombings, the village of Vinh Moc moved underground.  Up to 100 feet down into darkness.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  My mother came down here to give birth to me.  And I lived in here for six years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The villagers carved over 5,000 feet of tunnels out of the earth, creating a complex that would house all 90 families of Vinh Moc.  13 entrances and exits leading from the inland to the beach. Showing me through the labyrinth is Con Taq (ph).  Born in Huawei during wartime, she has since moved to the DMZ to work as a guide.\\n\\nHow did they dispose of all of this earth and rock without revealing the tunnels?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The craters, the craters were everywhere like on the landscape of the moon, and you know, the dirt of the craters are so fresh, look new, so they just left them there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This was the maternity ward where Tan was born.\\n\\nWhere did people sleep?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have sleeping places.  Just like this, but smaller.  Two square meters only, just enough to put a bed.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  At the time, we were a\\n\\nfamily of four people, all living in that one room.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long did it take to build?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  20 months of digging.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  20 months of digging.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  By hand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By hand.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know, the farmer, they dug with their tools.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Under the bombing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  While the bombing is going on, they\\'re down here digging this out.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  No need to be scared.  The earth moved, but the noise was not loud. In here, it would not collapse.  This side vibrated strongly.  These two sides only gently. All was vibrating like that, but did not collapse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  How many children here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  At that time, there were about 30 kids, because older kids had to evacuate.  Those who were still too small and young stayed in here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did they play?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  Running back and forth. Lit up the lamp and chasing each other back and forth.  When mom said, \"come home for sleep,\" then we came back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So much of the time you were in total darkness?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You don\\'t even see -- you can\\'t see your mother.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Some people said that even when the parents, you know, feed the children, they need to touch their face and find their mouth and feed them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nChildren played here.  But people also emerged from these tunnels to kill or cripple Americans.  To shoot them, to plant bobby traps, and that\\'s what they did.  Six years in darkness.  And at the end of the war, the people of Vinh Moc emerged from that darkness.  And what did they do?  What was that like, after living in darkness for so long?  What was it\\n\\nlike to come out and be able to spend the rest of his life in the sun?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE), (UNINTELLIGIBLE), then I started fishing, following after my father as a fisherman.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you, wow, ready.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Looks kind of like a mackerel.  Good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nLast question, hypothetical, if the French or the Japanese, or the Americans, suddenly decided they wanted for some reason to come back, would he fight?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated on screen):  If they came back to cause trouble, of course I have to, because our people (UNINTELLIGIBLE) but happy and welcome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That\\'s different.  They\\'re all welcome if they\\'re tourists.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are particular sounds that come with waking up in rice country.  At Tanzang (ph) lagoon however, early morning is the end of a workday.  As fishermen who have been out on the water tie up close to shore and sell their catch in the early mist.  I\\'m meeting up with Lac (ph) for what she promised would be a very tasty afternoon snack.  Quan Banolet (ph) is set back from a quiet lane in the outskirts of town.  It\\'s a neighborhood place specializing in this. Ban bayo (ph), little pancake-like things made of rice flour, steamed in molds, and topped with crispy fried shallots and cassava paste and crumbled fried shrimp.\\n\\nSo show me how you eat this.  What do we do?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I had this when I was a little girl.  So you try to pick it up like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  I got it.  Just cut around the edge here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I feel so clumsy.  It\\'s been a while.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fold it over.  Oh, it just -- mm.  This is great.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is so nostalgic to me.  When I was younger,\\n\\nat noon, my mom asked me to take a noon nap, say if you take a noon nap, then I will buy you (inaudible), and I will sit there in front of our house waiting --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Waiting.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Waiting for her, with a dish, an empty dish waiting for her.  She would come, and then my mom would buy it for me. (inaudible), at the end of the day, we see who eats the most.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, so you\\'d have a stack (inaudible).\\n\\nWhat are they eating in the banana leaf?  Can we have one of those two?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, we can have everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, good, I don\\'t want to leave anything out.\\n\\nOh, yeah, there\\'s pan potluck (ph), made of cassava or tapioca with pork and more shrimp from the lagoon, wrapped like a tamale in banana leaf, then steamed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, you can open this thing.  It\\'s also (inaudible), in Vietnam, we learn how to unwrap the thing.  You have to know how to unwrap the things.  Unwrap these--\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m watching you.  Let\\'s get this right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You are doing it right, you are perfect.  I think you are an expert.  Maybe in the life before,  you were born here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In a past life?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this is shrimp.  Pick it up and dip.  Right?  Hmm.  Very nice.  They\\'re pretty too.  Look at that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s very honest.  You can see to what\\'s inside.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You call this type of eating an-choi (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An-choi is like for fun or playing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Recreational eating.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s not a main meal.  It\\'s for snacking.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Banramit (ph) is a delicious marriage of fried and glutinous sticky rice dumplings.  It starts with frying the paste in cooking oil.  Then unpeeled shrimp are stuffed into dough.  Place the chewy part with the crunchy part and sprinkle with chopped, fried shrimp.\\n\\nOh, wow, that looks awesome.  What is underneath?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rice base.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, okay.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But on the top is thin.  At the back is fried base (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s great.  Nice and crispy and greasy.  I love it. Anybody would love this.  It\\'s just amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s a combination between the soft --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The soft and the crispy, crunchy.  Delicious.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Last ride, a few miles out of town, whip across the rice paddies.  Just getting from here to there, this part of the world, it\\'s pure pleasure.  I\\'m meeting my friends for a country lunch.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the specialty at this restaurant?  Chicken baked in clay?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Another friend from the past, Ha Pham (ph), Lin (ph), of course, Lan (ph), and a new friend from Huawei, Tan (ph).  A last meal, some goodbyes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I have a question.  What make you stay so long? Because normally travelers come to Huawei, they stay only one or two nights.  That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What\\'s your impressions about it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s very laid back.  The food\\'s great.  It\\'s pretty. There\\'s a lot to see.  It\\'s a perfect place to go if you want to take your time.  It\\'s beautiful to me.\\n\\nFood\\'s coming.\\n\\nOut here, there are a lot of dishes like this.  Fill a chicken with lemongrass, wrap it in banana leaves, then cover it with muddy clay from the nearby rice paddies.  Cook in the coals, or a pile of burning straw, if you like.  Unwrap carefully tableside.  Section with sheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Smells so good.  Makes me hungry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Serve with a little lime and salt, maybe some chili sauce.  Squash, bitter melon and morning glory greens for veggies.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.\\n\\nSome unexpected last words.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On behalf of people in Huawei, thank you for you coming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you for having me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We wish you would have a blessed trip, safe and sound, and have success.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I learned many things from American.  I still remember some poems.  (inaudible) on a snow evening.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Please.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sometime drink a lot of beer. I forgot.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think I know, this house is in the village, though.  You will not see me stopping here to (inaudible).  My little horse must (inaudible) to stop at a farmhouse near.  Between the horse and frozen lake, the (inaudible).  He gives (inaudible) a second to ask if there\\'s some mistakes, the only other sound of (inaudible), and something else.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bravo.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we wish you have a good trip, a good fly.  Will you come back after you return to New York?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll come back to Vietnam, always.  Cheers, everybody, and thank you, all of you, for all your help.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Cheers one more time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is who came out of the ground, out of the jungle, the darkness, when it was all over.  And this is what they did.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  This is the story of one man, one chef, and a city.  Also it\\'s about France and a lot of other chefs.  And a culinary tradition that grew up to change the world of gastronomy.  It\\'s about a family tree, about the trunk from which many branches grew.  It\\'s about food, lots of food, great food.  Some of the greatest food on earth.\\n\\nWhat is it exactly about this place?  Over the past century, the system here, the tradition, whatever it is that took hold here, churned out a tremendous number of the world\\'s most important chefs. Chappell, Bocois and most importantly, influenced nearly all the rest of them.\\n\\n(on camera):  Why Lyon?  Why is this such a gastronomic capital?  Why all of these great chefs?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because Lyon is really positioned between the north and the south.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re locked in between Burgundy and Rome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Lyon is the second largest city in France, situated in the southeast of the country midway between the Alps in the east and the Mediterranean to the south.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was also a bottleneck when cars began the mode of transportation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Goes right to the heart of  the idea of driving the  destination on the way to --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Completely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Out of that system came chefs like this guy, Daniel Boulud.  Like Prince or Madonna, he needs really only one name. In New York or anywhere in the chef world, Daniel.  The name of his three star restaurant in Manhattan, one of many in an empire that stretches from London to Singapore.  He came from here, a farm outside the city of Lyon, through the city\\'s great kitchens into New York, then his flagship.\\n\\n(on camera):  So when did you start working with food? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m 14 years old, 1969.  I started as an apprentice in Lyon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  He started as so many French cooks of his time did, at the very bottom.  As a 14-year-old apprentice in the restaurant.\\n\\n(on camera):  What was your first job in the kitchen?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They used to call me the beaver, because I was just washing every single day.  They make you clean the vegetable, they make you carry all the boxes from the market.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At 14.  You can\\'t do that anymore, can you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t think you can make him work 12 hours a day and pay him maybe a buck a month.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The good old days.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Why Lyon?  Why here?  Look at the fundamentals, the things that Lyonais think of as birth rights.  The right to eat delicious cured pork in unimaginably delicious forms.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The art of chocolatery, Lyonais can\\'t live without it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pate, sausages, it\\'s an art that\\'s revered here and widely enjoyed.  Few names garner more respect from aficionados of pig.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Twenty ton just inside this room.  They are going mad with the prediction.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In a relentlessly cold room, pork shoulder, belly and fat back are fed in batches through a vertical chopper.  The sprinkling of seasoning and spices.  Removed in large balls of finely, but not too finely chopped leek.  You do not want to get your hand caught in one of these things.  Then mixed to smooth perfection with a dough hook.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lot of work.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Spread out and layered for consistent seasoning, formed into shapes and smacked to remove air bubbles.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Make sure the meat gets really tight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Into the sausage machine and piped into organic casings. Trust me, it isn\\'t easy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very light touch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Let\\'s see now.  Come on.  Let\\'s see this. That\\'s how you get pregnant.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s all in the meat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just release at the end.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s a serious workplace but with production nearly done, this being France and all, it\\'s time for a snack and some wine.\\n\\n(on camera):  Doing what I\\'m good at.  Eating.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Another of Lyon\\'s most famous sausages is made primarily from pig\\'s head with pork belly, pork shoulder, brandy, nutmeg and allspice mixed in for flavor.\\n\\n(on camera):  Man, it\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re going to eat with my father.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes?  He knows he does really good work.  He knows how good his stuff is.  Cheers.  Nice -- it\\'s a beautiful day in Lyon.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In Lyon, a city that believes absolutely in the power of food, one name is everywhere.  The name that brought honor, attention and millions of visitors to the city.  Though there have been many chef heroes in the annals of gastronomy, in Lyon and even cross France, one name stands above all others.  Murals, bridges, markets, casual brasserie, the name of Missour Paul is everywhere.\\n\\nOne of his most enduring institutions is this.  One of the nation\\'s great culinary schools.  Now, just to give you an idea of the standards here, the kind of  traditional dishes, baseline old school fundamentals you\\'re  expected to master before you  move on at becoming a creative genius all your own, meet these guys.  Matthew, Joseph and the institute\\'s top dog, Alain.  Chefs at MOS, all. Otherwise known as MOS.\\n\\n(on camera):  Otherwise pay your flight home, private.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Master chefs.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Every four years, they have this MOS competition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The master craftsmen of France.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s about 30 discipline of craftsmen where you can acquire the MOF.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  See that red, white and blue around their necks?  That means they made it through the brutally unreasonably rigorous competition that pits hundreds of top chefs against each other where only a handful survive.\\n\\nCertified by the highest in the land as being at the very top of the top of their professions.  MOF Challenges often include ultra old school classics not unlike the one we\\'re making today. Poulair au visse, thick slice of black truffle are slipped under the skin of a chicken from breast, the Rolls Royce of chickens.  It\\'s then tied, slipped inside a pig\\'s bladder and steamed until tender.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The idea is to concentrate the flavor of the truffle inside the bladder.  The dish they choose, it\\'s always in reference to a chef of the past and this was a dish they were doing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At times brutal world of the kitchen looks much of the time like a boys\\' club but where did they come from?  If we track back a bit to where it all began for Lyon and for many of the chefs whose names we now know and look up to, it all goes back to here.  Lamer Brassie, the godmother, the original master.  Teacher, chef, force.\\n\\nTwo restaurants with three Michelin stars.  An achievement no one, male or female, had attained and for many years, Lyon\\'s most famous chef.  Her influence runs right through every kitchen that\\'s come since and her graduates carry on her recipes and her traditions.  This was one of hers, a signature.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For the next hour, you keep putting it like this. The most miserable thing is when the bladder explodes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That\\'s never a good thing when a bladder explodes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As the chicken proves, the bladder is really tough to expand.  You have to talk to your bladder.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do all the time, believe me.  Please hold up, please hold up.  Not here, people are looking.  Wait until you get in between cars.\\n\\n(voice-over):  A rather luxurious sauce of more, much more black truffle and generous amounts of foie gras and triple cream.  Perfect. Nice milkshake.  Slightly pink around the legs but cooked through, the flesh perfumed by the generous slices of truffle.\\n\\n(on camera):  Who gets to eat like this?  We do.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How is it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Divine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see the perfect balance in the sauce.  If I was a chicken, that\\'s the way I would like to end up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even if I weren\\'t a chicken, I would like to go like this. Die surrounded by truffles and foie gras and fine wine.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOURDAIN (voice-over):  The roaring of a powerful engine.  The screech of rubber and off we go.  Kings of the road in our Citroen, two horse power classic.\\n\\n(on camera):  No power steering?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re kidding.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s like a toy car.  We\\'re going back in time a bit, to the area where Daniel grew up, where life was very different from New York.\\n\\n(on camera):  Were you the misfit of the family, rebellious or --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was quite rebellious.  My parents were talking to me about the idea of taking over the farm.  As the oldest son, that would have been the logical thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  The farmer\\'s life was not for you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  He grew up in a true farm family.  You milk the cows, tended the animals.  Daniel claims he never even saw processed food until he was a teenager.\\n\\nA brief respite by the side of the road and some passersby are apparently less appreciative of fine automobiles than we are.  A short consultation with an automotive professional and we are back on the road, back in this case to school.  This was Daniel\\'s old elementary school in a nearby town.\\n\\nI\\'m automatically taken back to memories of my own school days.  The smell of caustic pine cleaner, chalkboards and fear.  The cruel ministrations of tiny-eyed lunch ladies slopping can loads of prison chow into steam tables.  Tuna noodle surprise that haunt my sense memories still.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pumpkin soup today with onion, nutmeg and chicken stock.  Basic good pumpkin soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Marie, head chef, cook, host and server for 320 hungry and very discriminating French schoolchildren ages 3 to 12.  On the menu, prefix today, pumpkin soup, homemade cous-cous and a sauce supreme.\\n\\n(on camera):  This is a very sophisticated  meal for children.  I was a little -- in school, frankly.  Like a lot of other students, I want pizza, pizza, pizza, are the children here open to variety?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We want to make sure they always get a little challenge by how the food looks and the smell and also, the taste after.  I think she has a very strict budget.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In the USA, greatest country in the world, no doubt, we spend an average of $2.75 per student for public school lunch.  Compare and contrast.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s $1.50.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Did you eat this well when you were here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.  Bon jour.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The kids attack their food like hungry trenchermen, wiping out three servings in the time it takes me to eat one.  I guess they like it.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s good.  This is good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t think my chef in New York would do better.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These kids eat fast.  Look how fast this kid eats.  Turn your head, he\\'ll dish your food right out of your plate.  Push up your tray just like in prison, move it along.  Move it along.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They come to you and serve you.  Most important thing that we see here is the love Mary give to the food she make and to the kids she serves.  I think it has a lot to do with the reaction they have to food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Dessert is homemade fromage blanc, cheese with chocolate and orange segments.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you want to be when you grow up?  Fireman. Generate machine gun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  He wants to make --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Generate machine gun, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  Keep an eye on that one.  All right.\\n\\n(voice-over):  For a dope fiend, feeding the monkey means finding and sticking with heroin.  For one poor guy, it\\'s this.  French food, in particular, Lyonais food.  The cautionary tale of Bill Beeford, literary Lyon with a perfectly good job as fiction editor at \"New Yorker\" magazine, at the undignified age of 53.\\n\\nHe pretty much pulled up stakes, put his whole past life on hold and defected to France to learn how to cook.\\n\\n(on camera):  What happened to you?  You used to have a good job, you hung out a couple nights with battagli and next thing you know you\\'re living in France and cooking.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I discovered a whole world that the rest of the world didn\\'t seem to know about, just a very compressed and tense lifelong learned expertise and knowledge of food.  It\\'s not the food network and it\\'s not glossy magazines and it\\'s not something you get from reading a recipe book.  It\\'s something you get by just going deep.  I was afraid of France because I didn\\'t find when I took on the subject of French food, I would have to go really deep.  I went and thought we would have to stay for six months and we stayed for five years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  We meet at a uniquely Lyonais institution, a casual laid-back kind of pub/bistro with a limited old school menu and always, always an unpretentious vibe.  People come here to unwind, relax and eat with abandon.  So you say outright recently in one of your published works that Lyon is better than Paris.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lyon is beautiful, well-eating city and everybody here knows they have a really good life and they don\\'t give a flying fig if anybody else knows about it.  They don\\'t actually want visitors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you were to pick one iconic dish to represent, it would have to be the canel broche.  Not particularly fabulous river fish, pike, folded into a light dough until fluffy and airy, but still rich, adrift in a rich creamy, almost bisque-like sauce made with crayfish, creme fresh and brandy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s kind of a nice mix of France and Italy.  What a treat to eat together in Lyon.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If you really want to understand a place, love it the way it deserves to be loved, maybe you have to live there. Bill Buford did just that and made Lyon his home.  Today he\\'s taking me somewhere only someone from the home team could be expected to know about.\\n\\nBILL BUFORD:  It\\'s a beautiful day.  The sky is blue, we\\'re feeling the seasons changing and we\\'re about to go into a dark room, and you eat a very Lyonais menu and drink a vast quantity of wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What sinister bodies will be in there?\\n\\nBUFORD:  Only kind of people who would do this kind of thing on a bright pretty day, it\\'s a very male tradition.  You work hard, you drink harder.  Don\\'t be afraid.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t be afraid.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The mysterious, fabulous, goofy, wonderful bro-fests are basically eating and drinking societies that go back over a century, when the silk workers of Lyon would finish their night shifts early in the morning.  Hungry and looking to get, shall we say, completely hammered, they would take over, stuff their faces like heroes, blow off the proverbial steam in decidedly French fashion, which is to say no freaking guytallion nachos or mozzerella sticks for these guys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  All of them have special memberships?\\n\\nBUFORD:  There must be 50 of those that I know about.  You are invited to be a member and remain a member the rest of your life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The food is invariably deliciously dinosauric and heavy always glorious classics, the slow, slowly stewed neck and shoulder pieces of veal with mushrooms served over rice, hunks of bread and wine, and lots of it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It works, and for 50 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Do women have their own organizations?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are.  So somewhere on the other side of town, there are a lot of women sitting around drinking wine, eating and complaining about the men.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Then there will be, yes, singing.  And no doubt the telling of lusty jokes followed by serious official business.\\n\\nAlongside and some say above the names of the other culinary giants in and around Lyon is the name Trois Gros.  It sparked a dynasty of culinary excellence that continues today with Pierre\\'s son, Michel and his son, Cesar.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My dream always was to put it on my resume.  Bon jour.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Many have called Maison Trois Gros the best restaurant in the world.  In the \\'60s, the brothers, Pierre and Jao were early, important and fundamental innovators of what came to be known as nouvelle cuisine.  Behold, one of their breakout classics.  One of the truly game-changing, timeless, most influential dishes in history.  It seems now maybe a simple thing, but it absolutely turned the world upside down when it debuted on the menu in 1962.\\n\\n(on camera):  When you have a dish this  legendary, this iconic, there\\'s no escaping it.  The rolling stones will always have to play jumping jack flash.  If you Google Foie Gras, you will see this thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Forget everything you have been given.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Before this, fish was generally overcooked. It was served alongside elaborate garnishes, starches, vegetables. This simple, elegant, almost Japanese ode to flavor changed the way we cook fish in restaurants today.  And how we make sauces, what our plates look like.\\n\\n(on camera):  I remember seeing a picture of this as a young man.  I\\'m getting goose bumps seeing this.  Thrilling.  Perfect.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s beautiful.  The moment you put the fish in the pan.  It\\'s very important.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  From now, to you in the dining room in one minute. One minute is the time.  Perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Because it\\'s cooking all the way.  Perfect.  It\\'s a perfect dish.  It\\'s really one of the great ideas of the 20th Century. Fashionable.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sexy.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When in Lyon, one can\\'t help but a see line from there, from the rustic dishes of the farm to here, the classics of the great tables of Europe.  All roads lead here.  A major trunk of the tree that goes back to Karem and beyond.  Monseur Paul Boguza. The brigade.  The way it is done and has always been done since a military style hierarchy was instituted into the kitchen.\\n\\nWhen the only acceptable response to any question or any command is Oui, Chef.  This is the Special Forces, the S.A.S., of cooking.  And these cooks live to avoid, under any circumstances, disappointing their comrades, the hierarchy or Monseur Paul.  Daniel worked here and so have many, many who have gone on to run their own celebrated kitchens.\\n\\nIn the \\'70s as a young wanna-be cook, I managed to lay hands on a French copy of the classic cookbook, La Cuisine Du Marche and I struggled to translate the descriptions of dishes so fantastic I was quite sure I never, ever in my life would cook, much less eat.\\n\\n(on camera):  If you could please say how honored and grateful I am to be here.  This is a dream come true.  Over the years, how many great chefs have come through this restaurant and on to open great restaurants?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is a child somewhere around the world because everybody goes around the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  But he is and was part of the system.  He came up with his own cruel and terrifying masters and their faces are here. The towering and intimidating figure behind la pyramid.  Owl out of his kitchens same such figures as Francois Biese, George Perrier and many more.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was all the gang of the nouvelle cuisine. The \\'60s in New York.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Every great chef I have ever met has nightmares of they\\'re still a young man, they\\'re back in a kitchen and a chef is yelling at him.  Who were his masters?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A woman.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really? (voice-over):  La mer brassier at the ripe old age of 20, he worked as an apprentice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She was such a screamer.  You would fall on your butt, she was screaming so hard.  She was the first up in the morning and the last one to go to bed.  She would go to the market with three cook in the back of the truck and she would put the case of green beans or something and the cook will be sitting down making the beans, not to waste time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Truly a terrifying figure.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Truffle soup Elyssee.  I can\\'t tell you how many hours I stared at photos of this dish, how pathetically I tried to replicate it.  Never did I think I would get to try it, much less like this. Sea bass with a tomato bernaise sauce baked in a meticulously crafted crust.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a great moment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The fish is filled with a delicate lobster mousse and tarragon and wrapped carefully in pastry.  Notice the careful and tableside carving and service.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He has been making the same thing for 50 years. Paul has an amazing respect for classic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The peasant classic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tony, get closer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You are totally sending me every one of those pictures, by the way.  Wow.  Look at that.  This style of dish goes back long before cameras but it\\'s perfect.  Is there a more perfect assortment of colors and textures.\\n\\n(voice-over):  This one is a somewhat more luxurious version.  Beef flanks, oxtail, veal flanks, chicken, marrow bones, beef ribs, leeks, carrots, turnips, fennel and parsnips, served with its own deeply rich broth.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Think it\\'s enough for the two of us?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And then, this.  As if the chef had been listening to my deepest, darkest secret yearnings, an almost completely disappeared, incredibly difficult preparation of wild hare.  The animal is first slowly cooked, then coated by a sauce of its own minced heart, liver and lungs that has been thickened with its own blood.\\n\\nAfter more than six hours of preparation, the hare is served as the chef prefers, whole on the bone, the rich glorious sauce finished with truffles and chart chartreuse.  Absolutely the lost ark of the covenant.\\n\\n(on camera):  Everything great about  cooking is encapsulated in this dish. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We continue all over the world to make cuisine for many generation to come.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Forever.  I will never eat like this again in my life. Chef, Merci.  The meal of my life.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Today, I was treated to the  greatest hits of a glorious and fabled career.  For the first and probably the last time, I sat next to the great man himself and Daniel and I were served a menu that chefs will look back on in a hundred years and smile at appreciably, sentimentally, respectfully.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  So me and Daniel were going hunting and over lunch, we mentioned that fact to Paul, who immediately insisted, insisted that if we wanted to go duck hunting, we should come by his crib, and so we find ourselves  in the morning mist of le dawn, a rural area about a half hour outside Lyon.  Sure enough, in spite of his 88 years, and the fact that he\\'s been less than well, 9:00 a.m. On the nose, there he is, sitting on top of his beloved John Deere with his faithful dog ready to go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nice fresh morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That dog is happy.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The great chef loves this place, and you can see why. Monsuer Paul can\\'t safely hunt but is happy to chase around flushing birds for us.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beautiful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes, it is beautiful.  I could do this all day. That was about as good as we\\'re going to get.  If you look long enough, you start hallucinating.  You start hallucinating ducks where there aren\\'t any.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see that one falling?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  OK, not a moment to waste.  Quickly, a second shot.  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.  Right there.  Between me and Daniel and the dog, we managed to actually bag a few ducks.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good job.  Very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Easy shot.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Then it\\'s back to the lodge, clearly Paul\\'s happy place, where we meet up with some hunting buddies of the great chef.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You did a good job, no?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Success.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  It\\'s fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this the hunting lodge, the weekend getaway, hang out with the guys?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s where he comes every day, almost.  Look at the picture behind.  You see?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  For tonight\\'s meal, we pluck and roast some woodcocks over an open fire.  Cook up some well-aged duck and pheasant.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They make mashed potato here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  There a head in there somewhere?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s happiness right there.  I am a man of simple needs and I notice --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can spend the whole week and we\\'ll be hunting, we\\'ll be cooking, eating, drinking, and talking and that\\'s beautiful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It is for me a dream to spend this time with a legend.  But I\\'m thrilled that beaucoup himself seems delighted.  In Lyonnes, he\\'s the great chef, a public figure, a hero, an institution. Always treated with the greatest deference.  Here it appear he\\'s free to enjoy the simple things with friends, local farmers who talk to him like anybody else.  It\\'s a pretty damn magical thing to see.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Like so many of his predecessors, he\\'s basically a farm boy.  He grew up milking cows and doing farm work here on his family\\'s spread.  There is as it turns out, something of a restaurant tradition to build on.  The house on his farm was once a cafe as well, operated first by his grandparents and great grandparents.  The famous Cafe Boulou was not the first place to keep that name.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That kept it for 80 years, 100 year, then they closed it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Meeting Daniel\\'s dad, one seems to understand the roots of his perfectionism.  His mom, dad, wife, Katherine and Danielle collaborate with some debate.  On a super old school farmhouse classic.  The sort of things good times, bad times, a family could make with stuff always readily available on the farm.  Check this out. It\\'s a hollowed out pumpkin layered with toasted chunks of stale bread, nutmeg, grated cheese, mushrooms, fresh cream from the cows and the meat of the pumpkin.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And a layer of bacon also.  Man, it\\'s heavy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Are you concerned the pumpkin is go I think to try to get out?\\n\\n(voice-over):  Daniel\\'s dad can be a bit of a Golic MacGyver.  You don\\'t waste stuff and he\\'s a bit of an inventor.  An old washing machine turned still.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To seal it so there\\'s no air coming in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Leftover grape solids usually used to be make liquor, today a different use.  If we can get it out of here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why did you put so much cement on it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ll be using this delightfully funky stuff to flavor the steam that cooks the vegetables from inside the still.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Then we come back in an hour.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At dusk we settle for dinner.\\n\\n(on camera):  Look at that.  Incredible.  Look at that.  Wow.  The pumpkin is amazing.  We also have that great sausage.  Look at that. Cabbage and potatoes, all steamed in the still.  The flavor you get from the fermented grape, awesome.  Good.  So good.\\n\\n(voice-over):  If you know Daniel can\\'t really help himself.  He\\'s popping up and down, serving everybody, making sure everything is just right.  Sitting here with his family in the house he grew up in, you can see where it all comes from.  Their son is now a gigantic international success.  When he was a young man at 14 sneezing in the field, did they ever anticipate this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They all reflect the region hopefully.  But in the best case, they\\'re interdependent.  They come from each other.  In fact, who cooks in the great restaurants? Farm boys basically.  That\\'s who always cooked.  My deepest thanks to your mother and your father. Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Merci.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Next time my father will make you drive the tractor.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  For most of my life Libya was a word with bad associations.  Libya meant Gadhafi.  Libya meant terrorism.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pan Am Flight 103 went down in a blazing fireball.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Libya meant a bad place where a comical, megalomaniacal dictator was the absolute power.  Nobody in Libya, however, was laughing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Reports of explosions.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Clashes between rioters and security forces.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 2011, what was previously unthinkable happened.  The Libyan people rose up and fought for their freedom.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Heavy battles raging around the Libyan capital.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They fought like hell.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  The rebels are about to force Gadhafi\\'s complete departure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And they recorded the whole thing on their cell phones.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Libya.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s amazing arriving here after all you see on TV these days that Libya is, in fact, functioning at all.  But it is.  The fountains across from the Kornish are operating.  Traffic works, kind of.  At the Radisson, club sandwiches arrive on time in the lobby. The occasional flash of camo and a security scanner are the really only discordant notes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don\\'t want to take the --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.  We don\\'t, OK.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Inside the old part of the city, men slaughter a camel, while a girl records it with her iPad.\\n\\n(On camera):  OK.  He said no.  (Voice-over):  Kids are setting off fireworks in the Medina.\\n\\n(On camera):  Incoming.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Tomorrow is the Prophet Mohammed\\'s birthday, and people who have not known freedom for nearly 50 years are ready to celebrate. The Martyrs\\' Square was filled with families, kids, teenage skater boys and hotshots on motorcycles.\\n\\nIt\\'s wild.  An almost giddily happy.  Young men in the camouflage pants of the militias, most of whom were civilians until last year, do their best to sporadically keep order or just join in the fun.  Every kid above the age of 5 seems to have been issued a lighter and a fistful of fireworks.  Ambulances idle on the margins of the square to treat fireworks-related injuries, which there will be many.\\n\\nThis is Tripoli.  After 42 years of nightmare.  How to build a whole society overnight and make it work in one of the most contentious and difficult areas of the world is what people are trying to figure out.\\n\\n(On camera):  So before the war, did you think it would ever be possible?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you dream someday this will change?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  In Gadhafi\\'s country, you can\\'t say a word. You\\'d get killed.  That\\'s it.  It was impossible.  Then I joined the group, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The militia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Omar is young and was even younger when the fighting started.  He, like so many Libyans from around the country and many who had left, heeded the calls for revolution on Facebook and Twitter.  They fought in Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, and everywhere in between.\\n\\n(On camera):  Who won this war?  Young people or everybody?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody.  But the young people, they started it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was your day like as a revolutionary?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You keep one thought in your mind.  You do this for the next generation, for a better country, for a better life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You have a future now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Before people -- you know --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was no future in Libya before Gadhafi\\'s regime.  We are not going to sugarcoat it.  We are slaves for the Gadhafi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Baracuda is a seafood restaurant just out of town on the Mediterranean coast.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One of the best foods in Libya, I think, the seafood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The menu is not printed on paper.  It\\'s laid out right there for you on ice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have dots here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What do they do?  They just grill that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, they grill it.  Some garlic, some sauce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You pick out the stuff that interests you from the daily catch.\\n\\n(On camera):  OK.  Let\\'s get one of these.  One of these.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some shrimps.  Calamari, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  They cook it for you the way you want.\\n\\n(On camera):  Oh, beautiful.  Wow.  That\\'s delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the stuffed calamari, Libyan style.  So many seafood stuffed inside of it.  Like a turkey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good sauce.  Man, we are living large today.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we are.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what were you doing before the war?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was a travel agent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were a travel agent?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  And I was studying, too, medical school.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Many of the people who started the revolution, who fought in the streets with makeshift weapons, were like Omar. Medical students, garage mechanics, or simply teenagers.  They transformed themselves in a matter of months from kids playing PlayStation to hardened fighters and field menace.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nobody believed that he can be removed, really.  BOURDAIN (on camera):  Extraordinary.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How quickly after the uprising started did you begin to think that, wow, this is possible?  That we might actually win?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The first day of the uprising.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First day?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The day before, you figured, impossible, we\\'ll be stuck with this son of a bitch forever.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Forever.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And then a few hours later it\\'s like, wow, this might work.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Seeing groups with you going toward the Martyrs Square, demanding their rights, at that moment you feel that you can do anything.  That this is going to happen.  If it didn\\'t, we\\'ll die trying to do it.  At least I would die like men doing it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  So much has changed around town.  So much is changing.  New music, graffiti.  These things, they mean something. But centuries of strict social and religious values keep some things solidly the same.  Alcohol, for instance, is strictly forbidden.  Men and women follow hierarchal roles as before.  Since the revolution, there\\'s a tug-of-war over what is acceptable.\\n\\nOutside a mosque in the medina, men fill the narrow street to celebrate Mohammed\\'s birthday.  Snacks are passed around.  Women watch and record from the rooftops.\\n\\n(On camera):  There aren\\'t a lot of conflicts in the world where there\\'s a clear bad guy.  Clearly there\\'s a bad guy here.\\n\\nMICHEL COUSINS, CO-FOUNDER, THE LIBYA HERALD:  Exactly.  I mean, the one thing about Gadhafi is he believed he was the most important human being almost that ever existed.  I mean, he changed the names of the months.  He changed the date of the Islamic calendar.  Such megalomania.  And as you well know, anyone outside, if you mentioned the word Libya, everyone would just say Gadhafi.  Gadhafi stole the identity of Libya.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Michel Cousins is the co-founder of English language paper \"The Libya Herald\" and has known several different Libyas in his lifetime.\\n\\nCOUSINS:  For so long the news has been the personality.  Gadhafi turned up to open a shopping center.  Gadhafi turned up to open an envelope.  Those of us who knew Libya, who knew there was another Libya, wonderful people.  We would talk about it as you talk about a dead person.  Do you remember this?  Do you remember that?  And then in February 2011, suddenly there was resurrection.  The dead came back to life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We meet at a Libyan coffeehouse.  A traditional male-only sort of a joint.  Cafe culture is big here.  A holdover from the days of Italian colonization when Mussolini tried to rebuild Rome\\'s long lost empire.\\n\\nCOUSINS:  It\\'s just been the most amazing experience.  Seeing the rebirth of a country, of a people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I mean, last night\\'s fireworks.  There was a general sense of exuberance bordering on anarchy.  I mean, I felt very happy there last night.  If somewhat in peril.\\n\\nCOUSINS:  It\\'s Christmas.  It\\'s whatever, it\\'s the Fourth of July rolled into one.  Also there are people who are trying to stop it.  So puritans, extremists, if you want to say militants.  And what has happened is people have come out in defiance of that.  They\\'re showing, we want to have fun.  And remember for a long time in Libya, you couldn\\'t have fun.\\n\\nThe biggest misconception is that the place is turning into another Afghanistan and Iraq where you\\'ve got bombs go off, attacks.  But it\\'s not, as you\\'ve seen.  Libyans have gone through an awful time having fought for freedom.  People have died.  People have struggled.  And that\\'s going to hold them together.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Kids are selling fireworks across from the Marcus Aurelius arch.  One is constantly reminded that Libya was once a vital part of the ancient Roman empire.  That was nearly 2,000 years ago.  Tonight I was told was going to be an even bigger, wilder celebration in Martyrs Square.  But something has happened since last night.  The British Foreign Office has just told all UK citizens to leave Benghazi.  Libya\\'s second largest city.  Due to an unspecified threat.\\n\\nThe Libyan government, such as it is, has denied any basis for such drastic action.  A lone cherry bomb now and again, an awkward flurry of Roman candles.  The buzz of last night\\'s chaotic partying parched, big time.  Whether or not this is the result of the larger geopolitical situation, the vibe toward this western film crew seems apprehensive.  Uncertain.\\n\\nThe following day feels better.  Somewhat.  Fresh produce is for sale on Tripoli streets.  If you were a small restaurant, or shopping for a big family, you\\'d bring cash, a wheelbarrow, and load up on what you need.  But the revolution has brought changed tastes.  Libyans, especially young Libyans, hunger for more than just freedom.  They hunger for places like this.\\n\\n(On camera):  Kentucky Fried -- Uncle Kentaki Fried Chicken.  OK.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The Colonel, and his buddies, the king and the clown, have not quite made it here given the uncertainty of the situation. So in the meantime, places like this have been popping up.  (On camera):  Uncle Kentaki.  Awesome.  You know where Kentucky is?\\n\\nJAWHAR, EX-FREEDOM FIGHTER:  Kentucky is from USA.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A part.  Yes.\\n\\nJAWHAR:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This place is new?\\n\\nJAWHAR:  Yes.  It\\'s new.  Before Gadhafi --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Impossible.\\n\\nJAWHAR:  Yes.  Now it\\'s normal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s nice.\\n\\nJAWHAR:  How you found it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Spicy, delicious.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Jawhar, like many Libyans his age, fought to overthrow Gadhafi.  He was there, gun in hand, when they stormed Gadhafi\\'s palace compound.\\n\\n(On camera):  Happy, excited?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nJAWHAR:  It\\'s give to me nice feeling.  Nice feeling that Gadhafi -- he\\'s killed my cousin.  How we should be feeling?  Exactly I\\'m feeling good because I want to kill them.  I don\\'t want -- I don\\'t want anyone to die in war.  He\\'s killed for nothing.  The first time I think that killing people is bad.  But he\\'s leave me do that.  Because if I don\\'t kill him, he\\'d kill me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  It\\'s nice to see freedom.  It\\'s nice to see the bad guy gone.  It\\'s nice.  I feel welcome here.\\n\\nJAWHAR:  Finally.  We say no on him.  He\\'s now died.  That\\'s what we wanted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  To Jawhar, a few pieces of greasy fried chicken eaten in a brightly colored fast food setting means something more than a calorie (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nJAWHAR:  That\\'s we why fight.  That\\'s we why give it all blood for my country because I want the feeling that, the taste of freedom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  The taste of freedom.\\n\\nJAWHAR:  It\\'s a nice taste.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.  Good food.  (Voice-over):  Outside Tripoli\\'s center, there\\'s this.  One time axis of all power and untold evil.  A huge complex and sinister offices, barracks, residences, on top of erratic war and of secret tunnels and underground facilities.  The Bab al-Azizia, Gadhafi\\'s enormous compound.  Most everything belonging to or associated with Gadhafi was destroyed.\\n\\nNATO continually bombed strategic locations within the compound and on August 23rd, 2011, it fell to rebels.  Gadhafi and his family having fled.  This is what\\'s left of Gadhafi\\'s palace.\\n\\n(On camera):  So when\\'s the last time you were here?\\n\\nOMAR:  Last time is when the revolution is finishing.  The machinery, going in first fighting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOMAR:  After then, the people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOMAR:  After then, coming a lot of people, normal people.  Listening about something expensive here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nOMAR:  Like the salt and like the gold and --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pardon?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop now.  Stop now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They want us to stop filming right now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  While talking, we didn\\'t notice several pickup trucks of local militia had closed in on us.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop.  Stop.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I\\'ll stop.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  You stop.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just relax.  Relax.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  Relax.  Relax.\\n\\nOMAR:  What\\'s happening?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is their turf, or their area of operation, or somehow under their control.  Whatever the case, they\\'re the group in charge today.  An argument ensues between our guys and their guys.  All of whom fought against the same forces on this ground a year ago.\\n\\nOMAR:  They need an authorization just for this place.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nOMAR:  They want to delete the tapes.  Let\\'s leave.  They said you had to delete what you\\'ve got.  Let\\'s leave.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  OK.  Let\\'s go.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hold it down.  Hold it down.  Hold it down.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Libya has denied that there is imminent threat to safety of Westerners in Benghazi.  This follows Britain\\'s advice on Thursday that Westerners should get out of the city.  Warning of a specific and imminent threat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If you follow the news you\\'d be reminded about how the lack of centralized power in the wake of the 2011 conflict has seen an increase in Islamic militancy in Libya.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Westerners and Libyans are still very concerned with --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What you see is not encouraging.  Kidnappings in Algeria, unrest in Mali.  Terrorist cells to the south.  Deadly riots in Egypt. And of course, extremist attacks in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador.  All those things are very real concerns.  But if you only look at what\\'s on the news, you can miss maybe what\\'s a bigger picture.\\n\\nAnother morning in Tripoli and life goes on.  Vendors are out.  People go about their daily routines.\\n\\nAKRAM, FORMER FREEDOM FIGHTER:  This is our traditional breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What is this dish called?\\n\\nAKRAM:  Sfenz (INAUDIBLE), which is an overstretched doughnut, I suppose.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  With an egg.\\n\\nAKRAM:  With an egg on top.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s a little pancake they put on top?  Just to hold the egg in?  AKRAM:  Yes.  Just to hold the egg in.  It\\'s like a hat to cover up something.  You can get them with cheese, you can get them with chili paste.  You can have them with honey, with sugar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are you having?  How do you like yours?\\n\\nAKRAM:  I like mine cooked, to be honest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s the name of this neighborhood?\\n\\nAKRAM:  This is Hashnum (ph).  This is a cradle of the revolution.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  This was the first neighborhood to rise up?\\n\\nAKRAM:  Yes.  This is the first place to rise up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why do you think this neighborhood and not --\\n\\nAKRAM:  It\\'s an impoverished neighborhood.  It\\'s been always liked here by the regime.  They made them feel like they\\'re not from this country, to be honest.  And we go for it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes, dip.  Right in the egg.\\n\\nAKRAM:  And dip it in the egg.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Delicious.  So where were you when it all started?\\n\\nAKRAM:  I was in London.  Well, actually Manchester at the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?\\n\\nAKRAM:  By the 27th, I was in Libya.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We went out to see his house yesterday.  The compound.  I was one of the guys who entered from the southern gates.  The northern gates.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Akram is in the security business.  A thriving industry here as you could probably imagine.\\n\\n(On camera):  A lot of things happened in a lot of different parts of the country, sort of simultaneously.  Kind of amazing that all these people came together very fast.\\n\\nAKRAM:  How did it happen?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nAKRAM:  Ease city.  Twitter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Twitter?  It was really like that?\\n\\nAKRAM:  Yes.  We sent so much information to NATO via Twitter.  We get a phone call from Tripoli or Benghazi or whatever.  We get to call this via Google Earth.  BOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nAKRAM:  We verify that there is a location that needs to be hit.  Send the tornado at NATO then it\\'s gone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nAKRAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How does that feel knowing you can call in a Tomahawk missile over there?\\n\\nAKRAM:  It\\'s out of the movies.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did anyone think it was possible and in their lifetime they\\'re going to see the end of this son of a bitch?  Most people are telling me they\\'ve never dreamed.\\n\\nAKRAM:  I don\\'t know if you call them dreams, hopes, wishes.  It was just something in the sky.  Something I look at every night.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nAKRAM:  But when I hit that point and got into Misrata and stood on Gadhafi\\'s body, any dream will come true.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s the situation now?\\n\\nAKRAM:  It\\'s fluid.  It can swing any direction.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, look, what happened in Benghazi a few months ago, I mean, what does this mean to the country?\\n\\nAKRAM:  I think there is a dark mysterious hand that doesn\\'t like this country to prosper.  They see system and organization as a big enemy to them.  These are slowly getting diminished.  It\\'s a matter of time before we can get rid of them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How hard do you think that\\'s going to be?\\n\\nAKRAM:  Not hard at all.  We got rid of Gadhafi.  Nothing else is hard.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like your attitude.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The fluid situation in Libya has been intensifying since our arrival.  We\\'ve had to change our behavior, constantly moving.\\n\\n(On camera):  Should I be wearing one of these cool, like, journalist safari jackets at this point?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  So it seemed a good time or maybe not.\\n\\n(On camera):  Saddle up.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  To go to Misrata.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, guys.  We can go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Roger that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Since the revolution, Misrata has been the most secure city in Libya, but over the last two weeks in a hail of bullets and hand-thrown grenade attacks, an imam, security forces and a police officer have all been killed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want you to move forward.  Come past me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All along the narrow congested highway, there are checkpoints manned mostly by local militias, and I want to stress most of them are friendly enough.  We are, however, in a hurry to get to Misrata before dark.  Traveling at night around here is not advised.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would drop the camera pretty soon.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the camera.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pulling in a town after dark, it doesn\\'t feel like a happy place to be right now.  Misrata is where some of the fiercest and most heroic struggles of the war occurred.  Resistance was the most determined, and the response by the Gadhafi forces especially merciless.  We\\'ve just learned that earlier in the day, a city councilman who was a hero of the revolution was assassinated, and it\\'s not clear who\\'s responsible.  Misrata is on full lockdown.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Another checkpoint.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Looking around at the price this city paid for freedom, you can see why they don\\'t want to lose what they fought so hard for.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nDON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  I\\'m Don Lemon.  We\\'re watching breaking news right now on CNN.  Violent weather tearing up towns in the Midwest and Central Plains tonight.  Tornado warnings and that means tornadoes are on the ground.\\n\\nI want you to take a look at this video now.  This is Shawnee, Oklahoma.  That\\'s a tornado that hit there earlier.  It is a huge one. A giant one that spanned at least, at least a quarter of a mile.  I want to bring in Chad Myers now, our severe weather expert here, our meteorologist.\\n\\nChad, where are people in danger right now?\\n\\nCHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  You know, still, Don, we have tornado watches all the way from Minnesota down to Oklahoma.  A couple of storms are still rotating at this hour which means they could have warnings on them.  Think about this.  Warning has more letters.  It\\'s more important than watch.  Which is a shorter word.  Warning, the bad word.  Watch, the not-so-bad word.\\n\\nBut still, it\\'s out there.  You can still get something during a watch.  The warnings could still go for the rest of the night here from Okmulgee, back on even to the north.  We get all the way up into parts of Minnesota, into places just north of the quad cities.  We\\'ve had tornadoes on the ground today.  Tonight.  We could even have some now in the dark, in the dark part of the day, those are the most dangerous because typically spotters don\\'t see them in time to put out warnings sometimes -- Don.\\n\\nLEMON:  Hey, Chad.  Look at this video of the damage.  It\\'s just amazing to take a look at this.  And this is what we\\'re getting in.\\n\\nMYERS:  Oh, my.\\n\\nLEMON:  Getting in all evening.  We\\'re going to update you on this at 10:00 p.m. Eastern.  And Chad is going to take us through this and tell us exactly what we\\'re seeing.  And what a monster cell this was. We\\'re back at 10:00 p.m. Eastern.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Morning in Misrata.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How\\'s the vibe?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s all very quiet and (INAUDIBLE) at the moment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Daylight reveals the extent of the fighting that took place here not so long ago.\\n\\nHAMID, FORMER FREEDOM FIGHTER:  This here used to be a vegetable market.  Clothes, one of Gadhafi\\'s soldier\\'s clothes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  He left him here and ran?\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.  That\\'s what they did in Tripoli.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHAMID:  Went to the city.  Just lose their clothes and run away in the streets so nobody would know who are they.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is Hamid, one of the guys we called the Misrata boys, basically militia members from the area who looked out for us here and Tripoli when things started to get hinky in neighboring Algeria and in Benghazi.\\n\\n(On camera):  Seriously a tank.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  His job these days is hunting down former Gadhafi supporters.\\n\\n(On camera):  So the Gadhafi forces rolled in.  They would use these tanks to fire --\\n\\nHAMID:  Around the city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Around.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.  It was full of tanks here.  This was the operation room.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Now if you had any doubt about the terrible odds these young revolutionaries were facing during the early days of the fighting, especially in the months before NATO came in with air support, check out Misrata\\'s war museum.\\n\\n(On camera):  What did this fire?\\n\\nHAMID:  Fired a rocket.  Homemade.  There\\'s a rocket here.  We\\'ve got it here.  And fight --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You had to have some serious courage to ride around with this thing.\\n\\nHAMID:  Why?  We trust our people.  There are a lot of homemade things here.  This is homemade, too.  Fires rockets.  This is homemade.  This one.  This was from helicopter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHAMID:  We got it and we put it on the car.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You took it all from a helicopter.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes .\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And you put it on a car?\\n\\nHAMID:  Uh-huh.  And you know what this is for?  You know motor?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So basically a cross bow that fires Molotov cocktails.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.  Molotov and TNT sometimes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re shooting this at people who have mortars.\\n\\nHAMID:  And tanks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tanks.\\n\\nHAMID:  Thanks.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re shooting this at tanks.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.  That\\'s what we got at the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s what you had then.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s awesome.\\n\\nHAMID:  The next president of Libya, the one who\\'s going to be in charge.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nHAMID:  This is his.  He has to think twice before he sits on it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So never screw your people.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.  And never screw your people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  I remember.\\n\\nHAMID:  And here, these are Gadhafi stuff.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This was all taken from the compound.\\n\\nHAMID:  Some from Serbs.  That\\'s his AK and chair.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Preferred hair products.\\n\\nHAMID:  His shaving kit.  See he was wearing a mask.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beauty mask.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I could use some of that.\\n\\nHAMID:  Gadhafi, he\\'s beautiful, you know.  And this is the first martyr in Misrata.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s the first.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes, that\\'s the first one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who was he?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nHAMID:  That\\'s a normal guy that went out to protest the first rally and somebody come in and shoot him.  So next day the whole city came out.  That\\'s when everything started.  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  These are photos of those killed during the uprising.  Combatants and bystanders alike.\\n\\nHAMID:  Her name is Muna.  She was six days when she died.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Shelled in their homes, tortured to death in prisons.  Shot by snipers.\\n\\nHAMID:  Look at (INAUDIBLE).  He died with a victory sign.  They killed him like -- with a grenade.  That\\'s his lucky day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHAMID:  You know what he was saying?  He\\'s saying, what\\'s going on, guys?  Why are you doing that?  We still have the T-shirt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.  With the blood in it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you know any of these people?\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes, I know a couple of them.  I knew a couple.  This guy\\'s Egyptian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not even his fight but he came.\\n\\nHAMID:  He didn\\'t want to leave.  All of them, they died in Sirte. And this died in Tripoli.  These are brothers and sister.  One, two, three, four.  They died on the same day and the same house.  And the mother when we found her, she was holding the kid.  They were both dead like and holding each other.  It was a very sad moment.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s how you turn a corner in Misrata.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I don\\'t know if you noticed, I\\'m going full Blitzer on this shoot.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The Mediterranean Sea defines Libya\\'s northern border. In shacks built along the coast, people get together on weekends to do what people do everywhere in the world in one form or another since the beginnings of society.  Like barbecue?  Who does not like barbecue?\\n\\n(On camera):  There he is.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  They sure like them here.  Chase down an animal.  Kill it.\\n\\n(On camera):  Cycle of life.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Cut it into pieces.  And throw it on a flame.\\n\\nHAMID:  Freedom Fighters.  Ex-Freedom Fighters.  BOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nHAMID:  Chilling, having fun, making barbecue.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  To start, they grill a lamb in small pieces with a few veggies.\\n\\nHAMID:  Not beer.  But something like it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.  It\\'s been about a week without alcohol of any kind.  I\\'m enjoying my new clean living lifestyle.  That\\'s hospitality.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  I said it before.  I\\'ll say it again.  Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it\\'s a start.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People in Misrata good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Relax.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Laid back.  In American, laid back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Laid back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  A stew made of kidneys, liver and heart served family style.  Feel free to eat with hands.  Right hand only, please. And a really traditional thing left over from the Italians, basically pasta with ragu.\\n\\n(On camera):  What\\'s this dish called?  It\\'s good.  The Italians left you one good thing.\\n\\nHAMID:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few nice buildings and pasta.\\n\\nSo the story of Misrata, the story of Libya seems to be ordinary people suddenly called upon to do extraordinary things.  Where were you when war broke out?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I was in Canada, Montreal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Studying medicine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Dr. Sheehan (ph) put her medical studies on hold to help tend all manner of horrible war injuries.\\n\\n(On camera):  What kind of procedures were you doing on a regular basis?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everything.  Everything.  Without prior practice and (INAUDIBLE) you\\'re just kind of in this situation trying to pick up things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many -- how many patients did you treat a day?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sixty, 70.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sixty, 70.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s, like, a lot.  It\\'s like the whole -- like the whole hospital was full.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When you heard he\\'d been killed?  What did you feel? Relief?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Relief.  I was like realizing that, OK, it\\'s over and trying to heal my own wounds because in the middle of it you just go, go, go, and you never realize how much injuries and trauma you get inside yourself.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because before you never think we\\'re going to survive and we\\'re going to have a free Libya or anything.  You\\'re just like going with the state of mind that I\\'m going to do my best and I\\'m ready in peace with myself if I die, and then you find yourself here now.  It\\'s like -- now it\\'s the gray area.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Sheehan risked her life along with the men, but traditional and high bound rules of conduct do not allow her to sit with them during dinner.  She\\'s relegated to what might be the called the kids\\' table.\\n\\nWhat can one say?  We who like to think of ourselves as more enlightened in this area?  I don\\'t know.  Rightly or wrongly I said nothing.\\n\\nWhat does freedom mean?  I don\\'t know that either, I guess.  For sure it does mean the freedom to enjoy an afternoon no one thought possible only a little while ago.  The freedom, at least, to joke, to laugh, to be for a while relatively carefree.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  The road to Tripoli, a healthy Supreme Court fast.  Oh, liver sandwich.  When they talk about a high-risk environment, I think they were talking about this.  That\\'s good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Halfway back to Tripoli, the magnificent ruins of Leptis Magna.  Arguably the most intact remains of a Roman city in the world.  It\\'s worth noting that at one time the emperor of all Rome was himself Libyan.\\n\\n(On camera):  That\\'s pretty amazing.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Born right here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Someone chipped off all the legs.  BOURDAIN (on camera):  Not that I was looking.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Anywhere else in the world this place would be overrun with tourists, but, look, no one.  You\\'re free to wander as you wish.\\n\\n(On camera):  Quite a backdrop, you know, seeing a little dinner theater production of \"Our Town\" a couple of thousand years ago.  Not bad.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The only other visitors today are a troupe of Libyan Boy Scouts.  Bizarrely enough, Gadhafi himself was once a Scout and this is one of the only organizations allowed to remain independent of the government.\\n\\n(On camera):  Maybe I should go down there and introduce myself, my former comrades.  Exchange some Boy Scout lore.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Yes, yes, I was once a Boy Scout, too.\\n\\n(On camera):  Hello.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Drilled into their heads is something that was long ago drilled into mine.\\n\\n(On camera):  I promise to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.\\n\\nYou know, it\\'s been a really difficult shoot for a whole lot of reasons.  It\\'s not easy to shoot here.  But in spite of all of that, for me this was a happy show.  It\\'s Libya.  It was supposed to be the bad guys, a bad country filled with bad people, right?  I don\\'t think so.  I met a lot of really nice people here.\\n\\nNobody is saying we\\'re going to be perfect tomorrow.  Everybody seems to be saying, you know, in five see us -- look at us in five years. Today that\\'s a pretty reasonable attitude.  This is a place that\\'s filled a lot of extraordinary people who have done an extraordinary thing on very short notice under very difficult circumstances and at a very difficult time who are continuing to do the best they can, and I wish them well.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  After nine days of threats of imprisonment, confiscation of footage and what was the most chaotic, difficult, yet amazing trip of my life, the last thing that stands between us and our flight home is the reason we came.  The Congo River itself.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Erik, this ferry cannot move today because now they\\'re closed and they have to be paid tomorrow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The U.N. truck just said he\\'s been here since this morning.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'ve had friend who\\'ve been held up for days.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What\\'s up, Freddie?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re going to start the engine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re starting the engine.  Awesome.  Just broke down again?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We now have one hour of daylight left.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They buried the engines and then they started.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, great.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here it comes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You learn quickly.  In Congo, things change at a moment\\'s notice.\\n\\nWelcome to the jungle.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nEveryone gets everything he wants.  I wanted to see the Congo.  And for my sins, they let me.  In \"Heart of Darkness\" Joseph Conrad writes of his alter ego, \"When I was a little chap, I had a passion for maps. At that time there were many blank spaces on earth.  But there was one yet, the biggest, the most blank, that I had a hankering after.\"\\n\\nThis then is the Congo.  The size of all western Europe combined.  It should be Africa\\'s wealthiest nation.  The people forget, or never even knew, that the 20th century\\'s first holocaust happened here when Belgium\\'s King Leopold managed to bamboozle the world into giving him personal title to the Congo.\\n\\nLeopold\\'s agents of whom the mythical Kurtz was one, raided, slaughtered, mutilated and pressed into forced labor much of the population, in a bloodthirsty quest for first ivory and then rubber. When independence finally came, the Belgians trashed what they could and left behind a completely unprepared, tribally divided and largely ungovernable land mass, filled with stuff that everybody in the world wanted.  And things pretty much went downhill from there.\\n\\nBut this story begins with the truck stop.  In Rwanda.\\n\\nStocking up in Rwanda.  My expectations for food in the Congo are more measured.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to get to the eastern Congo action and many would ask why you\\'d even want to do that, the best way is to drive across from neighboring Rwanda.  This country, of course, not too long ago, suffered its own appalling genocide.\\n\\nBehind the wheel, Dan.  He\\'s been living in the DRC for two years, working on a documentary about some of the several dozen rebel groups in the country.  Riding shotgun, Dan\\'s close friend and associate, Horeb, a Congolese.  They\\'re taking me across the border.  One side, Rwanda, hotels, paved roads, Internet, and paperwork to be filled out.\\n\\nJust a few feet of barbed wire, machine guns and cement walls away -- this.\\n\\nWelcome to Goma.  A city of one million, the significant number of whom are IDPs, internally displaced people, sitting, rather inconveniently, at the base of Mt. Nyiragongo.  A still smoldering volcano.  Its current street level is about 12 feet above where it was in January 2002 when it last erupted.  Lava everywhere, which explains the less than smooth ride.\\n\\nOne of the first things you notice out the car window, the U.N.  About four months ago, the M-23, one of the various rebel groups holed up in the jungle nearby, invaded the city.  The NGOs battened down the hatches.  The U.N. stood by, hands tied.  Everyone else had to fend for themselves until the rebels withdrew.\\n\\nThe Congo was a place I\\'ve dreamed of visiting since before I ever thought I\\'d get the chance to travel the world.  Actually being here, I\\'m not so sure.\\n\\nDan, Horeb and I head for a local restaurant.  Good food is going to be a challenge soon, so we take the opportunity to fill up on what we can.  Grilled chicken, gugali, pirripirri pepper.  Pretty nice meal.\\n\\nDAN MCCABE:  Goma in the \\'50s, tourists used to come as far as Rhodesia up here to vacation.\\n\\nHOREB BULAMBO:  Amazing wildlife.  I remember in my childhood seeing lions just along the side the road sometimes.  Goma was a touristy place for a long time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re not coming anymore?\\n\\nMCCABE:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  You\\'re just saying no.\\n\\nMCCABE:  It\\'s a red zone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s looking like there won\\'t be house-to-house fighting or artillery or mortars dropping into Goma.  Was today a good day?\\n\\nMCCABE:  Right now we have a rebel group just 10 kilometers north of us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMCCABE:  And then we have a -- maybe several groups that are all caught in the blender, you know.  So --\\n\\nBULAMBO:  Things change quickly in Congo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Confused yet?  Virtually all of the eastern part of the country is being contested by rebel groups.  Some local and others allegedly acting on behalf of interests based in neighboring countries.\\n\\nRecently the largely Tutsi Rwandan backed M-23 has been active in the area around Goma, but the mostly Hutu FDLR is also here.  The Mai-Mai can refer to either somewhat generic local self-defense groups or specific entities like APCLS or Checka.  Some groups like the FRPI are principally defending a stake and a resource like gold, and others like the Raia Mutomboki are mainly interested in fighting with a particular enemy, in their case they have a beef with the FDLR.\\n\\nAnd lots of other organizations controlling territory who haven\\'t come up with a name or cool acronym yet.  This is only a fraction of the rebel groups in a single area of the Congo.  And be advised this map was hopelessly outdated before we even got here.\\n\\nMCCABE:  It\\'s all these variables kind of knotted into one big mess. These are the reasons why media has a difficult time, why the Western world doesn\\'t hear much about Congo, because how can you sum it up in a three-minute report?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But for us Goma is just a stopover on the way to the Congo River.  So we need to keep moving.  And roads, forget it.  Certainly nothing even remotely safe between Goma and where we are headed.\\n\\nWe\\'re flying so Kisangani, this is the preferred route.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve chartered a Bush plane, formerly Queen Elizabeth\\'s flying wardrobe.  When the queen traveled, presumably in her younger years, her clothes followed in this beast.  Or so we\\'re told.\\n\\nI have not seen this model of plane before.  This is a first for me.  Of course you\\'ll learn to take nothing for granted in the Congo.  Just as we\\'re about to take off thunder, lightning.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Weather looks fine to me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s get this thing airborne.  Wow, nice.\\n\\nHas to wait this one out a little.  Crashes are pretty commonplace. Not so long ago a plane with nearly 100 people on board went down on the same route we\\'re taking today.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Most planes that crash in Congo crash because of the weather, right?\\n\\nBULAMBO:  Yes, most of the time, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not us.  Don\\'t worry.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBULAMBO:  Impossible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The weather clears up, sort of.  So we decide to give it a go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When the weather is very bad, stay on the ground.\\n\\nMCCABE:  What about rebels?  Are they shooting at the planes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  Normally, no.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nOK.  We\\'ll see you after your trip.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Have a good one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lifting off from Goma, we head out over the shores of Lake Kivu before circling back north-northeast.  Our destination, what Conrad referred to in \"Heart of Darkness\" as the inner station.  Here surrounded by dense jungle lies our rendezvous with the Congo River, a waterway response for both building this country and helping to destroy it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Two hours out of Goma, we land at Kisangani.  This was once Stanleyville, and the second largest city in the country before war and neglect cut it off from the rest of the Congo and the world.\\n\\nStanleyville, known in \"Heart of Darkness\" as the inner station.\\n\\nThe Congo River stretches across the country\\'s middle.  Conrad describes it as a twisting snake with its head in the Atlantic Ocean and its tail buried deep in Africa\\'s heart.  To Europeans, it was a natural route to transport slaves, ivory, rubber, minerals.  The commodities upon which modern-day Brussels and Antwerp are built.\\n\\nFor the Congolese, both before and after the Belgians, it provided more basic things.  Water to wash, to clean your clothes in, to cook with, to drink.  Also fishing.  Since long before the expeditions of Dr. Livingston and Henry Morton Stanley, the Wagenia tribe has been fishing the river in unique fashion.\\n\\nHighly coordinated and acrobatic, the Wagenia dived into the treacherous rapids in what is still referred to as Stanley Falls. Navigate downstream between baskets that need tending.  Perched on a precarious network of wooden poles, they hoist together.  The catch these days -- not much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So it is the second biggest falls in the Congo River.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ogee (ph) is Wagenia fisherman and was a guide bringing tourists to his village.  Since the last two wars, Kisangani tourism has been pretty much nonexistent.\\n\\nChief of the Wagenia, Pierre Musala Abeka (ph).  It is said is a direct descendant of King (INAUDIBLE), who greeted Stanley in the 1870s.\\n\\nPlease thank him for the privilege of seeing his community.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a present from the chief.  This is a way to welcome the delegation of CNN.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Wagenia tribe made what was in retrospect the mistake of allowing Stanley to pass.  The famous explorer, of course, pretty much shot and raided his way along the historic route to the coast before effectively jump-starting the colonial period.  Using Stanley as administrator King Leopold of Belgium claimed the Congo as his personal property.\\n\\nUnder Leopold\\'s reign, men women and children were tagged with numbers, separated into groups, given production quotas.  If they fell short, they were whipped with a (INAUDIBLE), their hands cut off, hanged.  An estimated 10 million Congolese were either starved, worked to death, executed or just killed where they stood, all in just over 20 years.  By the end, half the population of the country was gone.\\n\\nHave you ever thought about all those years ago if your people had just killed Stanley?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Someone else would have come.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Somebody else would have come.\\n\\nOrdinarily a large tiger fish like this one, it\\'s going to the market, considered way too valuable to eat.  But today -- guests.\\n\\nIt\\'s a mean-looking fish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She used to sell fish in the market.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Congolese standard, limboke.  It can be pretty much anything wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Typical tradition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Excellent meal.\\n\\nA lot of work.  Though it looks like you\\'re not having an entirely miserable time of it.  The water looks good.  On a good day, how many like these?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On a good day, 50.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fifty.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, 50.  But in time to ancestors.  Ancestors didn\\'t use to catch this.  They\\'d just catch the big fish.  One basket like this, they used to catch about 10 big fish.  But the situation changes.  The tourists used to come and see how the fishermen are catching fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Hundreds of them used to come, yes?  Well, things get a little better here, maybe they come back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I hope so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hope so, too.\\n\\nAfter Leopold, the Belgian government took over and pretty much continued as before.  An apartheid-like system of what\\'s mine is mine and what\\'s yours is mine.  By the \\'50s, there was a beautiful modern infrastructure built.  Railroads, hotels, sports clubs, schools.  The envy of Africa.\\n\\nHumphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn were here while filming \"The African Queen.\"  They stayed at the luxury hotel the Pourquoi Pas. This is the Pourquoi Pas now.  Like everything else of that time a hollow ruin inhabited by squatters or simply eaten by the jungle.\\n\\nBut none of this was ever for the Congolese.  They weren\\'t allowed in many of these buildings, except as help.  Not even allowed to walk their own streets after dark.  Not a lot of dependable electric power left in the city, but what lights do glow around town, much of it comes from places like this.  Small kiosks serving the Congolese version of barbecue and what passes for cold beer.\\n\\nChristian is one of our fixers, tasked with keeping us on track and out of trouble, which, believe me, is a big job around here.\\n\\nYou know, it\\'s an amazing looking city, if you blur your vision a little bit, you can see it the way it used to be.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beautiful.  I think it could be the best place to live.  Very kind people.  People like listening to music, drinking their beers, eating.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s the Congolese word for barbecue?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Barbecue.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like any meat on a grill.  It\\'s looking good.\\n\\nGrilled goat, with kabri (ph), a traditional goat stew on the side.\\n\\nNow we\\'re talking.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They roast it.  They put some sauce in there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As you can see, people don\\'t eat meat.  Meat is quite expensive, almost $2.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is a lot.  That\\'s more than most people make in a day or even two days.  What are the first things you buy if you\\'re very, very, very poor?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very poor, soap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Soap.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because at least you have to look a bit clean.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So soap first.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Soap.  But in between, as Congolese, you have to think of dressing, looking smart, clothes.  All these Congolese you can see here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you give them $10, they will think of at least paying soap or food, and keep maybe $1 to buy a shirt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So that\\'s called pride.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  And there\\'s hope.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can plan for tomorrow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For tomorrow.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In \"Heart of Darkness\" Conrad writes about the greed of the Belgian colonizers.  They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got.  It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale.  And after 75 years, the Congolese had had enough.\\n\\nBut independence came quickly.  When the new country managed to inaugurate their first democratically elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, the CIA and the British working through the Belgian, had him killed. We helped to install this miserable bastard in his place -- Joseph Mobutu.  He stole billions of dollars from his people and pretty much became the template for despotism in Africa.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this situation deteriorated over the 30 odd years. And by the time Mobutu is done the Congo was mired in a series of civil wars, the government was no longer paying its bills, and the trains basically stopped running.\\n\\nThis is Kisangani station.  There\\'s one short run left.  Service once a week, when operational, which isn\\'t often, I\\'m guessing.  Abandoned by the Belgians, shot up and stripped by rebels in the \\'90s.  The station, the engines, the ancient passenger cars, and the tracks themselves have slowly receded into the jungle.\\n\\nAnd yet all these years later, with hardly any resources, Monsieur Alub Emile (ph), the railway administrator and a staff of clerks, conductors, mechanics and engineers, show up at work and do what they can in an attempt to keep things in working order.\\n\\nHow do you do?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He says you\\'re welcome to see this place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many employees still work here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When it is running well we are above 500 people. But these days we are about 200.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So at one time you could dispatch a freight to South Africa?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we could leave here and travel to South Africa, with connections, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So a hypothetical question.  If the government said, OK, we are ready.  We have the money, we would like to, as quickly as possible, get operational, does he have the workers ready to go?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, of course.  If we are running today it is thanks to the competent workers we have.  Almost everything is broken. If we could only receive modern technical support again we could really move forward.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this is one of the few things here that\\'s working today.  A feature of great pride to the staff.  The railway employees, I\\'m told, do not get paid, yet they continue to show up and work.\\n\\nIt is said of the building of the country\\'s once vast rail network, one Congolese died for every single tie.  Like many Congolese we meet, they are, all these years later and in spite of everything that\\'s happened, ready and waiting for the situation to improve.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, until you thought yourself bewitched and cut off forever from everything you had known once.  So Conrad described the Congo after piloting steamships in the early days of Belgian colonialism.\\n\\nI\\'ve had something of a multi-decade obsession with the Congo.  It\\'s been kind of a personal dream, if you will, to travel the Congo River. And now, for better or worse, I get that chance.\\n\\nWe\\'ve rented a trusty vessel, and I shall dub thee \"The Captain Willard.\"  All right.  Did you maggots load the chickens?\\n\\nFinding food along the way, it\\'s anticipated, will be a challenge. Refrigeration of any kind is impossible.\\n\\nOK.  Well, I\\'m psyched.  My dream has finally come true.  Blocked by officials?  This could be months.  OK.  Let the probing begin.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do we do this?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s get under way before they figure a new tax to levy on us.\\n\\nOur trip downriver will take us some 120 kilometers, even deeper into the jungle, but instead of Kurtz and its ivory hoard, a crumbling Belgian research center with a shadowy past awaits us at our destination.\\n\\nIt\\'s the turn of the century map, so Kisangani was then called Stanleyville.  Leopoldville would be here.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Three thousand kilometers or something like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A long way to go, and we\\'re taking a full ride.\\n\\nMCCABE:  That\\'s what we\\'re doing, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All the way to the Atlantic?\\n\\nMCCABE:  You didn\\'t tell them yet?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t think we have enough SPAM, gentlemen.\\n\\nA half day\\'s journey downriver there\\'s a local dignitary we\\'ve promised to visit.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Yes.  The chief who is coming down.  BOURDAIN:  We arrive, late.  But the king is still waiting for us. Traditional headgear, not so traditional suit.  The medals given by the Belgians proving his royal lineage.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This place belongs to the Mombuli ethnic group.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And he\\'s the king?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My father ruled from 1928 and I came after him in 1963.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a lot of history.  Incredible.\\n\\nWe gave him a goat as a way of saying I\\'m sorry for being so late and sorry we can\\'t stay longer.  And he gives me a simple, yet hefty- looking bracelet which only later do I come to appreciate for what it is.\\n\\nHoreb tells me it goes back to Arab Portuguese times.  The Arab taught them how to do it.  They wear them on their wrists or their ankles. This is older than our story, probably.  The chief said his father gave it to him in 1935.  So who knows, man?  Wow.\\n\\nSo where did you get the bracelet?  Oh, an African king gave it to me, the Congo River.  Where did you get yours?\\n\\nWe\\'ve come a long way downriver.  With many kilometers still to go attention has turned toward the evening meal.  I figure I\\'ll make coco (INAUDIBLE) which is a pretty simple way of dealing with a bunch of tough, old stringy birds in one pot.\\n\\nGetting close to killing time.  The moment of truth.\\n\\nIt\\'s quickly getting dark.  And I\\'m very aware of a number of things.\\n\\nHow do they usually kill chickens?\\n\\nMCCABE:  Small knife.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Small knife, cut the head off?\\n\\nOur chickens are thin, scraggly, and tough.\\n\\nMCCABE:  He\\'s biting me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In order to make anything, any kind of edible, I\\'m probably going to have to stew the crap out of them.  But first we\\'ve got to kill these things and collect their blood which if you know anything about chickens, and most of my crew don\\'t, takes time.\\n\\nMCCABE:  I\\'ll hold the bucket, you kill the chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you want to eat, you\\'ve got to kill your own chicken and pluck it, too.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Time to get killing, killing.  BOURDAIN:  But every man has a breaking point.  And in retrospect, perhaps this was ours.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Harder.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Harder, harder.  You\\'re almost through it, man.\\n\\nMCCABE:  No, I\\'m not.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clean kill.  Clean kill.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now you can join our tree house.\\n\\nBy the time our birds are cleaned and plucked, the sun is down and dinner is still a long way off.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clean out the chickens.  It\\'s time to kill chickens.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Somewhere down the Congo River, and I\\'m continuing to deal with a few pressing concerns.  The one knife on board is as sharp, really, as a soupspoon.  And soon I\\'m frantically trying to rip out the backbone and guts in on ego with my bear hands because the knife being shit, and it\\'s getting darker and darker, and the damn generator keeps kicking out.\\n\\nI really need light so I can see what I\\'m cutting.  I can\\'t cut what I can\\'t see.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two light bulbs out right now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s only 240 watts.  There\\'s no way it\\'s the draw.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re not going to eat at all.  I\\'m never going to get through with this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Machete?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, maybe we should figure out how to cook dinner unless you don\\'t want to eat because we really won\\'t eat anything because we are really not going to eat anything tonight.  OK.  I\\'ve had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and I would like to eat, especially as we\\'ve gotten through all of this misery with these chickens.  All right.  This machete --\\n\\nIt would be apropos to point out that we do not want to be moving at night.  We would not like to run aground in the middle of the freaking Congo.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Swimming now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is he worried about crocs?  The current\\'s unpredictable.  Visibility, nil.  Time to tie up for the night.  Generator issues more or less fixed, but now another just as serious problem presents itself.  With the lights burning, it becomes insanely buggy.  Crush the wrong one of these moths, while swatting your face and you will blow up like a balloon.  Seriously.\\n\\nOK.  Take the other two bottles of wine.  You pour all three bottles of wine into the -- into the onions.  All right.  Let\\'s put the top on, bring it up to a boil.\\n\\nThree hours later, it looks like the jungle-style stew might actually work out after all.\\n\\nOK.  So who wants to bring this over, carefully, to the table?  All right.  Let\\'s eat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bon appetit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bon appetit.\\n\\nIn the end, my coco (INAUDIBLE) was scrappy, but passable.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Tastes like chicken, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is written that I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice.  I think I now understand what that means.\\n\\nNext morning on the river, and of course we\\'re not alone.  Fishermen from all the surrounding villages have heard of us, and have, long before we\\'re even awake, come by to check us out.\\n\\nCan you find a couple of onions for me?  Don\\'t go crazy.  If we don\\'t have them, we don\\'t have them.\\n\\nMCCABE:  I will not go crazy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  I will get on the SPAM and egg patrol.  They may have had invented the stealth bomber, maybe this will be our crowning accomplishment as a culture.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get in there, boys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once we finally get there, we\\'re supposed to get all the way back.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Coming back was never part of the plan, man.  We\\'re not coming back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  They\\'ll find us 10 years later naked in the bush with like a necklace of SPAM cans.  That was glorious.\\n\\nTime to get back out on the river.  We have places to go.  Two days down the Congo, we\\'re finally nearing our destination.\\n\\nMCCABE:  It\\'s an abandoned Belgian research station.  But it\\'s still functioning in some capacity, but the Yangambi itself goes about 30 kilometers in, there\\'s over 250 buildings.  They are doing it all here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Much myth and legend surrounds this place.\\n\\nOh, there we go.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It has been inferred by some that the Belgians conducted uranium enrichment and a host of bizarre experiments here.  However, the facts would suggest the scariest thing to ever happen here, some genetically modified banana varietals.\\n\\nMCCABE:  Yes, man.  We\\'re in Yangambi.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Deep in the jungle and miles from anywhere, this was once the Institute for Agricultural Studies of Congo.  Construction began in the 1930s, the complex was once staffed by hundreds of Belgian researchers, doctors and engineers until they left hurriedly in 1960.\\n\\nWith independence began a rapid decline.  The eventual cessation of funding.  Of the hundreds of structures built here, what used to be housing, laboratories, hospitals and research facilities, the vast complex\\'s library is clearly the most important to those who remain.\\n\\nThough crumbling like everything else, the grass is cut and grounds maintained.  It swept and kept clean, and yet most incredibly this man, Kasongo Bertan (ph), still fights a daily battle to stave off further decay to the thousands of volumes of books and research materials contained on these shelves.\\n\\nSo what happened here?  Did the place stay open?  Did people continue to do research?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s some new stuff, they don\\'t get anything. But for those who have been there for long, they get an allowance from the government.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Independence comes.  What happens here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whites left and many of them realized they shouldn\\'t come back.  As the institute was still operations in Rwanda and Burundi many of them crossed to the other side.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So unless I\\'m mistaken, the gentleman just said that cutting-edge research moved to Burundi and elsewhere.  The Congolese who remain, their mission all these years later has been to preserve the patrimony that existed.  All this was state of the art back in the \\'50s when the library was built.  But for 20 years there hasn\\'t been electricity to run the dehumidifiers to keep out the damp.\\n\\nThrough so many wars, through all of these difficulties, he has maintained this facility to an extraordinary degree.  Why?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They call me the mayor because if I\\'m not here, nothing works.  And I\\'m the one who knows the truth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Staff still show up to work and organize.  Catalog and write requests for funding.  Perhaps to Kinshasa or a central office where someone may or may not ever respond.\\n\\nHe was here pre-independence, yes?  Does he remember the Belgian rule?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He remember -- remembers the period of colonialism.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And that was the good -- the best time that they were living.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you say to someone who suggests that Belgian colonialism might have been the good times?\\n\\nThe road home.  Such as it is.  Rotting bridges, makeshift ferries, it\\'s an adventure.  Fortunately ours was a good adventure.\\n\\nThe Congo is a place that\\'s always fascinated me.  This is a trip I\\'ve been wanting to take since I\\'ve been writing stories or making television, but what I found was something unexpected.  I met a lot of people who for a long time have been waiting.  Hoping for things to get better.\\n\\nA lot more hope here than there\\'s any right to expect.  When all is said and done, I wanted to go to the Congo, and I did.\\n\\nHey, George.\\n\\nGEORGE STROUMBOULOPOULOS, CNN HOST:  Hey, man, how are you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really good.  Congratulations on premiere.\\n\\nSTROUMBOULOPOULOS:  Thanks, bud.  And congrats on the finale.  How did it go?  How was the season?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All good.\\n\\nSTROUMBOULOPOULOS:  All good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Welcome to CNN.  Got to practice that line.  This is CNN.\\n\\nSTROUMBOULOPOULOS:  This is CNN.  Do you channel your inner James Earl Jones?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do, I do.  Look, a couple of things before you -- before you go on air, OK?  You\\'ve got to know this stuff.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  I went looking for the dream of Africa.  I woke up in Tanzania.\\n\\n(THEME SONG)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The narrow streets and neatly dressed schoolchildren of Zanzibar\\'s Stone Town make it feel like a very different Africa than I\\'ve ever known.  It\\'s tight, small.  The architecture speaks of many layers.  The hierarchy long gone but still evident.\\n\\nThe famous Zanzibari doors, for instance.  Meticulously carved of mahogany and teak.  The patterns reveal details of the original inhabitants\\' ethnicity and professions.  Brass spikes evoke similar doors in India.  The lotus flower, a historically Egyptian symbol that\\'s meant to promote fertility.  And chains, a reminder that this once was a central hub of the slave trade.\\n\\nWhat Zanzibar is today is definitely and overwhelmingly Muslim:  99 percent of the population.  And you see a strong influence everywhere you look.  The children in hijab, coming from the madrassa.  The streets are neat, and private homes even of the very poor are maintained with great pride.  The call to prayer, five times a day.\\n\\nZanzibar, part of Tanzania but also a semi-autonomous state, sits just 30 miles off the coast of the mainland.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The minute you cross the ocean from the mainland, you feel like you\\'re in a different country and a different culture, different vibe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Saoud Saeed (ph) is a native Zanzibari and former tour guide, and he knows his way around these parts.\\n\\n(on camera):  So, what are our options here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is what we call mandazi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Mandazi, a Swahili treat, basically an African donut, or flitter, and vahias (ph), a fried lentil fritter, Indian, spiced with cumin, turmeric and coriander.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Care for a cup of coffee?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes, let\\'s do it.  (voice-over):  If you live here, if you\\'re from here, chances are you\\n\\nstart your day with some bitter spiced coffee.  Talk about the issues of the day, politics for one.  Maybe a pastry.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is that good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh, that\\'s good.  So, you\\'re born and bred here.  How long has your family been here?  How far back do you guys go?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m half Indian, half African, and my mother has been here four generation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Four generations, so that\\'s starting out in the...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Late 1700s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Who built this neighborhood?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Construction started in about 1830 in a Portuguese colony.  We are Portuguese, yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Portuguese stayed from 1846 and left in 1934, but they lost a lot of power in 1896.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Confused?  Let\\'s take a step back.\\n\\nThe Persians were the first major power to set up here back around 975 A.D., expanding their empire onto the strategically positioned island. Then the Portuguese used Zanzibar as a hub for their slave trade and spices.\\n\\nThen the Omanis (ph) did the same, ultimately with the British, who ruled through them.\\n\\n1964, revolution.  As with most revolutions, the days following were violent, chaotic and ugly.  After overthrowing the mostly Arab government, reprisals.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It wasn\\'t intended for a revolution where more than 3,000 Arab soldiers and a lot of Indian soldiers were moved out of this country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  But your family stayed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My family stayed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was no money for the family to move out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it was just -- there was no option?  Stick with what was left?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tough times?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very tough times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In about two hours from Stone Town, this is Jambiani, a tiny fishing village.  Here the first revolutionaries would meet and plan for an independent Zanzibar.  Zanzibar\\'s first post-revolution president, Abeid Amani Karume, served until his assassination in 1972.\\n\\nThis, too, is Abeid Karume, grandson of the country\\'s first president.\\n\\n(on camera):  Well, what was the situation back then, political situation back then?\\n\\nABEID KARUME, GRANDSON OF ZANZIBAR\\'S FIRST PRESIDENT:  Well, it wasn\\'t good.  Basically, it was English at the top, Arabs in the middle...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nKARUME:  ... and then the Africans are way, way at the bottom.  And it was a form of apartheid, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Was this village sort of a center for revolutionary...\\n\\nKARUME:  This village was important in terms of the political support prior to the revolution.  When my grandfather and my grandmother stayed right here and had meetings on the field right over there. That\\'s where they would have their meetings to raise support for the African and Shirazi people, their identity.  The objective was to give equal rights to all people of Zanzibar.  Of course revolutions aren\\'t the best thing sometimes when it comes to peaceful transition.\\n\\nWell, this is the house of Ban Asani (ph) and Ilanka (ph).  They\\'re preparing a wonderful lunch for us.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nGRAPHIC:  Your ghosts are here.\\n\\nKARUME:  This is Martha (ph).  She used to take care of my grandmother many, many years ago.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nGRAPHIC:  How are you two?\\n\\nKARUME:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nGRAPHIC:  We\\'re good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re here for lunch.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Deemlaka (ph) was a close family friend to Abeid and his grandparents, and she\\'s putting together quite a spread.  Coconut rice, freshly caught fish called tassi simmered in broth of garlic and lime, topped with um chusi (ph), a fresh salad of chopped tomato, eggplant, cucumber and potato.\\n\\nAnother fish, Cuvier (ph) or mackerel, marinated in juice and garlic, then pan-fried.\\n\\n(on camera):  Now, this is good.\\n\\nKARUME:  And you can use your hands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.  This I can do by hand.  The rice, I need help. Good.  That\\'s looking good.  So coconut rice.  Japati bread from the other\\n\\nside -- other side of the water there.\\n\\nKARUME:  That\\'s it.  This is cassava.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cassava?\\n\\nKARUME:  Two different types of...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pan-fried bread.  Look at all these kids.  Watch out. Future revolutionaries.\\n\\nKARUME:  In the end (ph), the only one who\\'s going to end up changing things come from them.  Think about it.  I mean, the challenges we face on a small island country.  That we all face sometime.  Have to preserve all these things and find balance.  For me, I see Africa as a whole.  I see a very interesting time.  I\\'m very hopeful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Optimistic?\\n\\nKARUME:  I\\'m optimistic.  I think the Zanzibaris are a great people. And, given the opportunity, I think they can put a lot on the table, not only for themselves but also for the culture in East Africa and possibly even the world.  They\\'re a great people.  Why not?  As far as an immigrant.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Say you\\'re going to Zanzibar and people will tell you about the seafood.  It\\'s pretty impressive.  In Stone Town or Downey Gardens (ph), every night vendors set up an insane variety of every iteration of seafood snack.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh, yes, I would love some of that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The first one here we\\'ve got tiger prawns.  We have octopus, calamari, with masala spice.  We have shellfish, we have a mussel small shell, a tuna fish, mahi-mahi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.  I think let me find some of the octopus.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Starburst (ph) lobster?  With masala spice.  But it\\'s not hot.  But if you like hot, we give you...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like hot.  All right, good.  Give me some chili mango with that.  All right, good.\\n\\nMmm.  I like it.  It\\'s chewy but tasty.  Lobster is working for me. Too spicy for you, ma\\'am.  Yes.  Believe me, only one of us is going to be shitting like a (UNINTELLIGIBLE) tonight.  And it\\'s not going to be you.\\n\\nThe famous Zanzibar pizza.  Awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cut up onion, beef, tomato fresh, cheese, mayonnaise, with egg.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sounds awesome to me.  Looks good.  Thank you.  Mmm.  Weird and wonderful.  Mmm.\\n\\n(voice-over):  These stands are extremely popular with locals and visitors alike, so of course the government raised the rents.  One guy, Juma, decided to pick up and move his place a bit out of town. His customers came with him.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Juma.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Hi, Juma.  How are you?  So what are we having?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beef on a stick, chick on a stick, half chicken and all the spices, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  I ordered beef for now.\\n\\nBeef is good.  I\\'ll take half a chicken.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Half a chicken?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Juma is famous for his chicken.  The bird is slathered with a mixture of garlic, lime, coriander, ginger, salt and pepper.  Then, it\\'s grilled and served either as a satay or whole pieces topped with Tamarind chili sauce.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Preparation for all this is Saturday morning, preparing, cutting and then coming here at 6:30 to finish about 10.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many guys are working here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s about six, seven of them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Six or seven of them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All around the table.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, it\\'s like a big operation.  He\\'s finishing the skewers, I guess he\\'s half-cooking or saucing.  He\\'s re-heating, finishing the skewers.  That guy doesn\\'t just set up plates for him to top with meat.  And then I guess they\\'ve got the bread and sauce and finishing them to go, also.\\n\\nWhat are they squirting on the fries?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s hot sauce.  There\\'s ketchup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you never go hungry here.  There\\'s always food in the street.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you come here to buy ten skewers, you\\'re going to eventually buy 20 or 30, because somebody is always asking for food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you always buy it.  It\\'s just the culture. You always shell out food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There we go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you use the stick as your fork.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hot, hot, hot.\\n\\nWhere do you think the recipe came from?  This is a real mixed-up history here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s mostly Arabic/Indian components with the spices, most of the trees like mangos came from India, pineapples came from Brazil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tamarind, southeast Asia, not even India.\\n\\nDamn, that\\'s good.  Damn.  The chicken is really awesome.  I might need some more of this.  I\\'m liking the heat, man.  Good stuff. Incredible.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The 250-mile flight from Zanzibar across the water to the town of Arusha takes an hour and a half.  But culturally, you might as well be flying from Texas to the Philippines.\\n\\nKilimanjaro, into whose white peak Hemingway\\'s gangrenous hero saw himself disappear as he slipped into death.  From there we head into the Serengeti.\\n\\nA journey of this kind, one must expect the occasional setback.\\n\\nWe reach the eastern edge of the Serengeti, where it\\'s a steep climb to the magnificent Ngorongoro Crater, once a massive volcano that somewhere around 2.5 million years ago collapsed in on itself, creating this caldera, a true lost word.  Inside the crater, an entire ecosystem within an ecosystem.  Wildlife pretty much stayed put.\\n\\nComing to drink, well, right below my place.  It\\'s nice.  Very, very nice if you find yourself here.  A hot bubble bath awaits after a long day in the bush.  Perhaps a dry sherry from a cut glass decanter.  The next morning one rises to breakfast in one\\'s chambers on the\\n\\nbalcony, perhaps.  Silver service, hot coffee, freshly baked croissant.\\n\\n(on camera):  Good morning.  Thank you, sir.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The rules of the house, while slightly restricting, are sensible enough, and given the luxurious surroundings and the view, hardly a burden.\\n\\n(on camera):  You\\'re not supposed to wander around at night here unescorted.  There\\'s, like, lions and hyenas and elephants and stuff. And while I\\'m told that baboons can get rapey, there were no knocks on the door.  You know, I know what you\\'re thinking already.  You\\'re not going to do what I think you\\'re going to do, are you?  You\\'re not going to go out there and shoot some beautiful animal in the brain. No.  Answer?  No.  What kind of sick (AUDIO GAP) wants to shoot an elephant?\\n\\nEven the toilet has a nice view.  This is pretty much what you see, because you\\'re sitting on the snakes.\\n\\nIdyllic natural setting and good plumbing, it\\'s pretty much paradise.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s nuts driving into the Serengeti.  After a short while you actually get used to the \"Jungle Book\" scene playing out in front of your car.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s interesting to see the giraffe and wildebeests, zebra.  They all seem to hang out with each together.  No conflict at all.\\n\\nCOLIN MCCONNELL, GUIDE:  Pretty much there\\'s no conflict in what they want to eat.  It starts with the elephants, buffalos taking the big stuff out.  The zebras follow it down, and the wildebeests are the really close crop.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  My guide is Colin McConnell, a fourth generation African born in Kenya, who lives in Tanzania and knows this area like I know the deli counter at Barney Greengrass.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  About every tree you see here that\\'s lying on its side hasn\\'t fallen out of choice.  It\\'s been pushed over by elephants.\\n\\nThere\\'s an elephant over there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.  Whoo!\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  It\\'s a big bull.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Magnificent.  Will he charge us?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If we piss him off?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  If we piss him off he would.\\n\\nThey sleep so soundly, these zebra.  You can creep right up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Zebras and more zebras, so many you almost get bored seeing a heard of them.  Giraffes looking only slightly irritated to be interrupted and ever more massive herds, stadium-sized crowds of wildebeests.  A Phish concert of these unkempt looking things every few hundred yards.  All that\\'s missing is a hackey sack.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  Everyone\\'s come to terms with now the wildebeest migration means wildebeests jumping into rivers, but in fact, that only happens two months of the whole year.  The rest of the year they\\'re trekking through the bush.  To me this is so much more spectacular when you see these big numbers.  You\\'ll be in an area this morning that was full of wildebeests and go there this afternoon, and there\\'s not one.  They\\'ve moved.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thousands and thousands of wildebeests on their annual migration are everywhere.  A big circle stretched out across Tanzania and into Kenya, in search of prime grazing.  It\\'s all about water and grass and a good place to make babies.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  I mean, look at this little guy.  He\\'s keeping up with his mom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  He\\'s doing OK.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  Within 15 minutes of being born, they\\'re up and standing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  Running as fast as their moms within a couple of hours.\\n\\nThere\\'s a wildebeest that didn\\'t make it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long has it been there?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  A day or two.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  Very fresh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You don\\'t want to get lost here.  You definitely don\\'t want to be on foot outside your car or injured, for instance.  Nature, as they say, is a cruel mistress.  It takes care of its own without mercy.\\n\\nThe evidence of this cool math called survival is everywhere.\\n\\n(on camera):  Non-immediate family, you\\'re not going to help a brother out.  MCCONNELL:  No.  You would think, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Start limping, first come the hyenas.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  The hyenas see the vultures dropping.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  And that\\'s key to them there\\'s food up.  And the vultures really need the hyenas to rip open the skin to start eating it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  By the time they finished ripping out your soft parts, treating your femur like a chew toy, the vultures and the marabou storks lovingly called the undertaker birds, are waiting for their turn.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about you, but whenever I have cause to reflect on a pack of hyenas tunneling into an ass and ripping out the guts, I think, you know what?  I could really go for some pesto right now.\\n\\nBy Lake Masek we paused for lunch.  Indigenous specialties like penne with pesto, steamed baby corn, and snow peas, grilled tomatoes sprinkled with parmigiana, oh look brownies.\\n\\nThose hippos are coming in close.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  Yes, they can smell the pesto.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They love pesto.\\n\\nThey\\'re coming ashore.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  You\\'re safe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Over thankfully cold beers, I learn who is really the most dangerous animal here.  Yeah that\\'s right, Mr. Lovable funny hippo, always in a tutu in the cartoon, a vicious, unpredictable and apparently incredibly fast moving killer.\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  You know, you happen to leave here and go for a pee behind the tree there...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  ... and come face to face with this hippo.  The hippo would easily outrun you, one big chomp, big tusks straight through you (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just get between them and their mud hole and they\\'ll be all over you like Justin Beiber\\'s bodyguards, it can get ugly.\\n\\nWhat do hippo penises look like?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  I have no idea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did a hippo never emerges from the water with like a... MCCONNELL:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... with a hippo hard on?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  Not that I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMCCONNELL:  No, they\\'re underwater.  I don\\'t go snorkeling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I find that comforting to know.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They are among the last great warrior tribes on earth. Semi-nomadic, they believe that all the world\\'s cattle are a gift of the gods to them, the Maasai People.  They move with their animals across the Tanzanian plains, setting up homes where they find the best grazing.\\n\\nTheir cattle are everything, the wealth of the family, units of currency, givers of milk to live and on special occasions of meat and blood.  The Maasai construct their villages or boma\\'s like this, a strategic hamlets designed to repel and discourage predators.\\n\\nINGELA JANSSON, FIELD BIOLOGIST, SERENGETI LION PROJECT:  We have a lot of livestock coming in here.  A lot of the other, like migratory games they\\'ve all taken off, so this area is quite famous for the cats, the big cats.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The big cats, lions roam free here, an area of the Serengeti called Nduto.\\n\\nJANSSON:  It\\'s a paradox, I mean the lions are an enemy to them, they are a competitor but they\\'re also something that they greatly admire.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Swedish native Ingela Jansson, a field biologist for the Serengeti Lion Project is trying to find a balance between the needs, traditions, and basic identity of the Maasai people to the outside world\\'s desire to protect these beautiful killing machines.  This is what could happen when a Maasai warrior defending his cattle takes on a hungry adult lion, nobody wants this.\\n\\nFor the Maasai being apprised of the comings and goings of the lion population is a useful thing, preferable to find out in advance one would think and take evasive action than the alternative.  But remember too and respect that the Maasai have always defined themselves and their identities by their enemy, a tribe of proud warriors.  What happens when there\\'s no one and nothing to fight?\\n\\nIngela has brought several Maasai on her team to show them up close the lions they share this land with.\\n\\nJANSSON:  So often on my days when I\\'m working with the Maasai, you don\\'t eat at all, you get a cup of tea in the morning and if you\\'re lucky in the rainy season you\\'ll get either fresh milk or this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is amasi by the way, a lumpy yogurt like drink central to the Maasai diet.\\n\\nJANSSON:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nAnd before you say yuck, it might be worth noting that between their nearly 100 percent protein diet of meat, blood, and dairy, the Maasai are known to have near super human cardio.  Olympic level stamina and condition, they can run miles at a time without rest or water and can basically kick your ass at near any physical contest given half the chance.  So, help yourself to some sour lumpy goodness.\\n\\nNot bad, a little honey, some raisins in there, good to go.\\n\\nJANSSON:  It\\'s so different here, like the rainy season, dry season. Such different challenges.  What do you think of going under here?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m OK with it.\\n\\nCurrently Ingela has been tracking two lions in particular, Ramus (ph) and Puyo (ph).\\n\\nJANSSON:  Oh Ramus is there.  Do you see him?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I see -- yes I do, there\\'re they are, I see them.  Wow, two of them.\\n\\nJANSSON:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You like them don\\'t you?\\n\\nJANSSON:  They\\'re magnificent.  They\\'ve very admirable.  He\\'s a bit of a warrior that one.  Should we try and approach them?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nJANSSON:  When you go for lions, you don\\'t -- never drive straight on them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nJANSSON:  You kind of go in an angle, that relaxes them.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny how they pretend they don\\'t see, but they\\'re so completely aware.\\n\\nSo basically what we look at to identify them are the spots, it\\'s like a fingerprint.  Puncturing in his face that means he\\'s fighting with females, because if they fight with other competitor males, it will be -- the wounds will be on the back.  It\\'s too dangerous to go for the head area of a fight.  The reason for the collar is to see how lions behave to cope with treats in the area, to show that lions and Maasai can actually stay together.  They\\'ve always lived together. For the Maasai one of the diminishing things for them is large grazing lands (ph) and it\\'s the same resource that the lion needs.  If push came to show and one part had to go.  It wouldn\\'t be the wild life that\\'s bringing in far too much money for this country.\\n\\nSo if they can show that they\\'re actually fundamental and to protecting this area and protecting the lions.  Well, then it\\'s the better for them as well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s total population of lions do you think the country want?\\n\\nJANSSON:  Tanzania probably has at least 25 to 50 percent of the total population of lions so it\\'s important country for it.  And the last estimate is 30,000 lions remaining and I think it\\'s no so much the worry of the size.  But it\\'s the rapid decrease.\\n\\nWe\\'ve lost large predators in the big part of the world.  The worlds carry on.  You would probably have other predators to take their place, you know, there\\'ll be the Hyenas, there\\'ll be the cheetahs, there\\'ll be the leopards.  Of course they couldn\\'t take the big prey like the lion does.  If you think about it that way, lions are a big show of an echo system that is healthy.  There important to that.\\n\\n20-22 hours a day they relax.  So if, you know, when seen enough you can capture one (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And they were beautiful.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just a few miles from the crater\\'s rim, the CEO (ph) village about 400 Maasai live here.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Olioderup (ph) is the chief.  He has four wives, 12 children a handful of whom are old enough to be out looking after the herds.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where are you from, Tony?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was born in New Jersey and live in New York.\\n\\nYou have a son in New Jersey, yeah?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.  He studied in one of the college known a Montclair State.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh sure I don\\'t know (ph) Montclair very well.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here (ph) where I grow up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh yes. JANSSON:  Look, look at that cloud there.  There\\'s going to be some downpour.  Well, do you think it come here Olioderup (ph)?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.\\n\\nJANSSON:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not us.\\n\\nJANSSON:  It\\'s funny like they always know what the clouds are doing, that\\'s our (ph) weather a report out here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Maasai have been migrating with the seasons since they came to this part of Africa some time in the 15th century.  Long, long before the Serengeti become a national park.  And here we run into kind of existential conflict we\\'ll be seeing more and more of as the world decide what they valued most.  Unspoiled expanses of nature populated still with magnificent wild but aggressively protected animals or the indigenous people.\\n\\nJANSSON:  The aim for our project is promoting coexistence with lions. So when I came here to start of Lion Guardians, there were many among them who would say that we\\'re very suspicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And she knows why.\\n\\nJANSSON:  They thought this is going to lead to us being kicked out, that\\'s a constant fear in this are.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because in the past the Maasai go to (inaudible) where they -- and they kill.  But today we stopped that, or we can kill if no way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you have no alternative.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, that\\'s why we have the spear.  We are not hunters (ph) people (inaudible) the spear (inaudible) for protection only.\\n\\nJANSSON:  The Maasai they trust that we\\'re here to kick them out, that we\\'re here to work with them.  And, we seeing that we\\'re going to be to start Lion Guardian project which basically you hire Maasais to protect the lions rather than kill them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With all of the cattle inside people house.  How do you protect them from predators?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The animal (inaudible).  If you do not bother them, they do not bother you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, how about when they grazing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When they\\'re grazing we have people who follow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And that\\'s enough to discourage hyaenas or lion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  But they sometime they\\'re happy lion so they making a loud to show themselves that they\\'re very happy.  And the way to make that is in \"woo, woo, ho, ho\" (ph).  That\\'s to make you happy, you know, that\\'s a -- if they does like to catch something we can hear very close only like \"grr\" (ph) and they\\'ll stop.  But that\\'s loud \"woo\" (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a happy one.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s a happy one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No problem.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But that purring one that, the second noise that\\'s good?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That one is not...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a here kitty situation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Those are all.  This one must looking for finding a food and maybe...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  Wow my cat hate me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, this a lot of you are going to find very disturbing.\\n\\nI\\'m guessing the little goat over there is about to get the bad news.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Come now and touch likes this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I try and be a good guest.  I eat what my host put in front of me.  I try to take responsibility if something dies for my dinner.\\n\\nStand here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This one?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All this and the horn.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So when the Chief asked if I care to do the honors and tells me how it has to be done, I\\'m not happy.\\n\\nIn fact, as I close off its air passages, I\\'m struggling to not throw up on myself.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nTony, do you know how to skin? I can actually...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not well enough.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ... maybe I can show you and then I can -- go ahead, OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Maasai traditionally kill their goats by suffocation for very good reason it turns out.\\n\\nThey keep the blood which is a vital component for the Maasai diet intact and abundant in the chest cavity.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It continue -- you notice (inaudible) skin out so we can cut it here.\\n\\n(OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nYou know.\\n\\n(OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nGood.  And then, continue like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, a little more.  Good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good, everything is intact, beautiful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s a blood, so all the blood...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It filled up the cavity...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... and started to get coagulate.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I get it now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is easy enough to take the blood out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s really -- I\\'ve never seen that.  That\\'s super cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  Someone like to drink fresh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sure.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not bad.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s good.\\n\\nPeople -- they eat this one is fresh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a kidney.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  You like a piece?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yup, just a little piece.  A little.\\n\\nDeep done, it\\'s time for a little kidney.  Enjoy the spoils, then party.\\n\\nIt\\'s sweet, actually, that\\'s good.  I like it better than like this than cooked.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That smelling good.\\n\\nJANSSON:  Yeah.  That\\'s true.  That\\'s very good.\\n\\nI\\'m not too much of a meat eater but this -- I kind of like the goat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even on the Serengeti, it ain\\'t a barbecue if there ain\\'t some kind of beer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Normally we have the Maasai, we love honey.  We have a -- we call honey beer.  The drink is just very strong.  So, we here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I love to try it some.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How can you (ph) change in the mood?\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nJANSSON:  Take one cup.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, one cup.\\n\\nJANSSON:  I find it...\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not bad.\\n\\nJANSSON:  You know, it\\'s refreshing, it\\'s fine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s like a palm wine or (inaudible) like kind of cool (inaudible) like a taste, also...\\n\\nJANSSON:  You can definitely taste the honey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nJANSSON:  The sweet.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  According to our culture, everyone has to carry a big knife.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody\\'s ready.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Many aspects of their lifestyle and traditions remain unchanged.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThis does not mean Maasai don\\'t have cellphones by the way.  Everybody does.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And they say when we\\'re talking about how can we balance this because they\\'re now looking to send our children to school, getting a good education but we still are staying very strong culture.\\n\\nYeah, he is really coming like a hard time but we continue.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve got some other question, you know, when your son comes back live from New Jersey, you know, is your son going to want a motorcycle, is he going to want a car, is he going to watch flat screen T.V.?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t know what for the future because as you know the children they\\'re very quickly changing their mind.  Maybe one day he comes and he\\'s a New Jersey boy.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s beautiful this country, this part of Africa.\\n\\nGeographically huge but not really as the world and what we need to live in it shrinks everyday.\\n\\nWho gets to live here?  Who or what do we want to see, is for better or worst who wanted to determine that.\\n\\nNearly $1.5 billion spent here every year by people who come wanting to look mostly at beautiful animals.  That is an amount it is hard to argue with and impossible to outrun.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nRENE REDZEPI, NOMA RESTAURANT OWNER:  Is it your first in Denmark?\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  I got to be honest.  I usually try to avoid clean, orderly countries without massive social problems.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nYes, I'm here for you, man.  Hope you're not the poster boy for the entire country.  You should be.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  We go, no?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, let's go.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were saddled with the weight of best restaurant in the world.  I know, this looks totally bogus.  It's fantastic.\\n\\nALESSANDRO PORCHELI, COOK IT RAW:  You need to work 20 hours a day in order to achieve this.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Come on, guys.  They're waiting now.  Let's go.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  It's so much less about whoo, you know, it's about bang. And elements, elements.  What places have you been that you can compare to NOMA?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No place.  It's a whole different world.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Beautiful.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was a place, a very special place.  A clean, orderly, and nice place.\\n\\nUsually I hate clean, orderly, and nice.\\n\\nThe air smells fresh and physically fit, statuesque blondes pedaled through streets lined by old buildings and canals.\\n\\nI read something very disturbing on my way here.  Apparently Denmark is, like, the happiest place on earth.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER) They actually keep stats on this.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Apparently Denmark is far and away number one.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The happiest, most content place on earth.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Well, the colleges are the same for everybody.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Free?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Free.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's un-American.  That's socialism, isn't it?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.  I mean, here, that's not a bad word.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, they pay, like, 60 percent of their earnings in taxes. But then they do get things like free health care.  Fifty-two weeks maternity leave on full pay.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  When I had my kids two rooms down, that's where the future king had his kids.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There's no, like, Beyonce suite?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  No.  We're all there.  We're all the same.  And that makes people more happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks like a nightmare to me.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By the way, it would be helpful to point out, this show is not about Denmark.  It's not about Copenhagen.  I'm here for one man.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Follow this way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nAnd one restaurant.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  And then we can start.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, chef.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  NOMA is the place where Rene Redzepi pretty much changed the whole world of gastronomy.  For three years in a row, it was named the world's best restaurant by a jury of chefs and food writers who presumably know such things.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) coconuts.  Also at the same time there's little (INAUDIBLE) flower.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Danish coconut.  Cheers to that.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And so the question.  How does this nice, down-to-earth guy rise to the top of the food world all while presenting things that no one could possibly think would taste that good?\\n\\nPORCHELI:  The flowers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  They're delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I'm not sure, but that's what I'm here to find out.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Have they had the moss?  Did you give them the moss?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, chef.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We know that NOMA has been said to be the world's best.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a dish that is 20-man hours of work.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And what we've heard outside of Denmark is that Rene sources his ingredients exclusively from the Nordic region, mostly from within 60 miles of the restaurant.\\n\\nThink about that.  Denmark is not exactly the Mediterranean.  Summers are short.  But Rene and crew started, what they're famous for, is foraging for ingredients.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Reindeer moss with last year's harvest of set mushrooms.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And color me dubious.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Did you ever eat moss before?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  That is incredible.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There's no way that this is going to look convincingly delicious on TV.  But it is really delicious.\\n\\nAlessandro Porcheli is Italian living in Denmark.  He worked at NOMA before starting Cook It Raw, the roaming Boy Scout camp for the world's best chefs.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  I met Rene in 2004.  Basically the restaurant was just opened.  BOURDAIN:  Ten years after NOMA's inception, Rene is arguably the most famous Dane since Hamlet.  And so it's happily ever after, right?  Not quite.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  It's funny that all this happened actually in Copenhagen. You have all these rules about this law, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  These guidelines were --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You don't want to stand out.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  You never brag about yourself.  It's all understated.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The law of Jante, which discourages attention-seeking, is part and parcel of living in Denmark.  Danes who think too big are often cut down by their peers.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  It's hard to really make an effort, and if you stand out too much, you know, get off your horse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, so let's say you start a restaurant and you announce right away, well, this restaurant is going to be different than anybody else's restaurant, you see (INAUDIBLE) coming here, are people mean originally or do they talk about you?  Do they --\\n\\nREDZEPI:  I mean, how much foul language can I use on this show?  We very quickly became the big band of the seal --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Seal -- people can be so cruel.  Do Danes like this place? No?  I mean, they're --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's got the attention of the whole world.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Yes, exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To tell the truth, food nerds, captains of industry, celebrities, you name it, have been flocking here for years.  Some waiting months for a reservation in a 45-seat restaurant.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do we have the soro leeks?  It's marinated in grasshopper (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's marinating.  All of this green snow which is made from the (INAUDIBLE) leaves.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's good.  The technique, you don't notice it.  You notice the flavor.  That's delicious.  That's really intensely -- it's like I've never tasted a green vegetable that good.  REDZEPI:  We're in Tubali.  You see there's like lawns, people sit down, the sun is out.  The birds are singing.  This is where happiness was invented.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tubali Gardens, it is said, is the second-oldest amusement park in the world.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Strolling here, watch the pantomime that's hundreds of years old.  I've only been here once with my kids, actually.  I work all the time, unfortunately.  This is usually the place where young kids take their first date.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How old is this thing?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  I don't know, man.  This is made for kids.  Does it feel a bit wobbly?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (INAUDIBLE) and ancient.  I'm a little uncomfortable.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You see, Copenhagen is dangerous, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, right.  Whoa.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  There you go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is not bad.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  So there you see.  It's a little tiny park.  This (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's not huge, is it?  Squished right in the middle.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  It's like Singapore.  You know?  All dense together.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No death penalty.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  No.  Only the sort of the public humiliation that you felt for something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, here we go.  Firearms, apparently, it's OK here.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You know, I've actually never fired a firearm in my life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  And I've never driven a car.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You've never driven a car?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Never driven a car.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  This is good.  This will be empowering.  This could change your whole life.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Every time you fire you need to reload.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You don't need to tell him, he's American.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  So is this a competition?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Call it what you like.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  All right.  Oh, this is exciting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We definitely have a winner.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Oh, my god.  Not a single one?  I have to --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's what we call a nice grouping.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  This is like public school, shooting range.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After this, we're going to steal a car.  I'll teach you to drive.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Come on, guys.  They're waiting now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Familiar with this one at all?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So traditionally it's served around Christmastime. We call them Abel skewers (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You've got a little fish rammed right through.  I love it.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Isn't it sweet?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And then there's a pickled cucumber in the middle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's great.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Isn't just awesome?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very traditional flavors.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  There's all these old school restaurants that have been here hundreds of years.  The herring, the rye bread, the smoked fish, the traditional stuff.  You know?  There we go.  Thank you, my good man. Welcome to the happiest place --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On earth.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  On earth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There we go.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  No ice.  Smoked eel.  Pureed shrimps.  Pickled herring. These tiny little shrimps, it's one of the few seasonal offerings that Danes look forward to.  Our eating traditions are not that big here. Historically, we've eaten for survival.  It was fuel to us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These things were not exactly the most fun bunch.  It was sinful to take too much pleasure in food.  You know.  You're sitting at the table, like oh, my god, that's so good.  It's delicious. You're already going down a slippery slope of who knows what other kinds of behaviors.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You know, my father is an immigrant here.  I'm not even a full Dane.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Your father was Macedonian?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mother --\\n\\nREDZEPI:  From the former Yugoslavia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And then you left Yugoslavia at what age?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Fourteen.  People make fun of me when I say I've never driven a car.  I never had a Coca-Cola until I was, like, 17.  It just wasn't in a small little village where there's two cars.  The first food memory I have is also from there and it was my father.  And the day before we'd been into the mountain picking chestnuts.  And I remember it so vividly as a little child, I woke up and I saw my father roasting chestnuts.\\n\\nAnd then I start hearing all these things popping.  Twenty minutes later, they were in a bowl and my aunt poured milk that she had just taken from the cow and we had that for breakfast.  It was so natural that we went to the mountain for chestnuts, you grew your food yourself.  These sort of experiences growing up, they really shaped the type of cook I am today.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  So now you have a generation of young cooks like myself and they're all over town looking for the flavor of a region.  What is the flavor?  What are the ingredients we have and how do we combine them in a way that tells something of where you are in the world?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Between me and nature, there's not so much love.  Nature is where bugs live.  But I'm learning reluctantly over time how much I've been missing.  Rene's proclivity to scrounge around for flavorful stuff that grows wild --\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Welcome to the beach.  You see good old Danish feet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pretty much kick started the restaurant world's now widely emulated practice of foraging.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You see all this?  Grass.  But actually these are succulents.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're doing beach cabbage for them, no?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Rene, since the beginning, is thinking about how to put into a plate what's around you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, you need to be like  a 19th century naturalist, you're going to have to do this.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Yes, you need to be a (INAUDIBLE).  A naturalist.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Chew on this.  You taste cilantro?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Cilantro.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Disguised as grass.  Here, here, here.  It's everywhere.\\n\\nGood to go?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Service, service.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So the raw is on the top deck.  (INAUDIBLE) paprikas around the outside.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So I know these ingredients, we were plucking them just today.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  This should be the future.  Let's go and forage, guys. Come on, kids.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  There you go.  Sea beans.  Salty, juicy, crunchy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, I'd look -- if I were looking at this at home, I would very much be thinking, come on, man.  It's grass.  It's grass.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's green stuff.  It all tastes the same.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It totally doesn't.  REDZEPI:  It totally doesn't.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now is some of this stuff poison?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you ever eaten something that --\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Oh, yes.  On-the-spot diarrhea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  The dark side of foraging.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Two fish heads.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Growing your own food, finding your own food.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That was life in Macedonia.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But for a lot of people right now, it is an affectation.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  The worst moments, the worst meals are when people are just following a sort of culinary trend.  And they will say, there's an edible.  But it tastes like -- but it's edible and it's foraged, therefore I put it on the menu.  You know, it's going to be -- go on the fish no matter what.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beautiful.  Grilled pike heads with the beach herbs you foraged yesterday.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You just pick off every little bit.  But I think even at its most ludicrous manifestation, surely it is a positive thing that people are actually starting to look around and see, where it grows --\\n\\nREDZEPI:  It still is good.  Because people are being connected to the place they're in.  What's edible and what's not.  What is there to eat.\\n\\nHere we go.  Jackpot.  This is mustard, beach mustard.  In three weeks, this is gone.  New things come up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's sour dough bread.  It's (INAUDIBLE) butter that has not been churned all the way.  It's called virgin butter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, god.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  This is amazing, huh?  BOURDAIN:  Butter like this where you can pretty much taste what the cow ate.  You know, anyone who's milked a cow, this is a flavor of childhood.  The fact is, there aren't a lot of people left to -- where I come from who milked a cow.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  This one is becoming more important to what these guys are doing.  It's a relationship also that they had with the farmers. Delicious (INAUDIBLE) dabbed with oil.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  So this is Soren's farm, but we always say our farm.  We feel like it's our place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Soren is Rene's primary supplier of farm meat and vegetables.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Look at the soil here.  You see all the muscle shells?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  These are shellfish.  Because this used to be marshland.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like Rene, he's not your ordinary Dane and his farm is unlike the others around here.  This used to be monoculture.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Fifteen hectares with carrot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just carrots.  And now how many -- what are you growing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Between 120 and 170 different things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  True, there are tractors and rows where potatoes and carrots grow.  But much of what's happening here is a mix of wild and cultivated.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  This is wild angelica.  That's chives and the purple flowers is --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.  Wild onions.  And you could grow them here.  Let's grow some for next year.  Here you go.  First time you come up here, you go into this, like oh, flower garden.  And you will say no, no, no, this is the leek field.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're so nice.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Touching them like they're jewels.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They are jewels.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Let's grab a bunch of these for lunch, no?\\n\\nIt's going?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, chef.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The pressure in farming is to have a monoculture and to provide year in, year out what you know is going to sell and what the market demands.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Do you mind grabbing a few of these plants?  They're going to grow up, so don't take the root.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's very, very hard for a small guy to say you know what, I'm not going to grow carrots anymore, I'm going to grow all bunch of different interesting things and I'm going to grow them as well as I possibly can.\\n\\nYes, this is pretty much a first for me.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  This is the first time you fall to your knees for a green plant?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  How long for leeks?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Had leek up, two leek up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think we'll ever reach a point where guys like Soren will be in a very good place?\\n\\nPORCHELI:  I think if we cut the middle men, guys, the producers, the farmer, to talk directly with a guy like Rene.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Nobody ever teaches you that the symbiosis you need to have intact is with these people that grow the food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You're never taught that as a cook, which is strange.\\n\\nCan we have another leek that looks more similar in size? OK.  Let's go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I think also respect to your chefs, how should you know anything about this landscape.  I've been here for 30 years and I just know small tiny part.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So just scoop it up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think we picked these yesterday.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Oh yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.  That is the meatiest (INAUDIBLE) vegetable I've ever had.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Maybe we'll cook this for lunch spiced with a tartar.  Chop that up with the freshly slaughtered meat, one of Soren's cows.  Hey, what else?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The asparagus?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes, let's do that.  I'm hungry, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Asparagus.  Beautiful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's go.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  And maybe just one dollop there in the middle, OK?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Asparagus.  With this (INAUDIBLE).  That's why we have the branch.  Do not eat that branch however.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Underneath is a small pile of tender (INAUDIBLE). Grilled green asparagus sauce and a little bit of fresh green paste.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is incredible.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Wow.  The flavor of this, huh?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  So this is actually beer made from asparagus.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's tasty.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.  What's the meat?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Veal.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Veal?  What was the name of the cow?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  76300330.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Chef, do you want to do this tartar?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are you thinking, just hack up the meat?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Hack up the meat.  It already looks good.  I'm going to go on the asparagus and the leeks.  Clean them up, grill them.  Sun lotion on these guys.  Do you want to do a potato salad?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  What you would put on the tartar.  Wild onions.  A bit of this horseradish.  That's the chives.  Chive flowers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  A little salt on the leek and a little cheese?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.  That's the angelica.  Take all these flowers and we mix that in.  Some vinegar.  That looks like vinaigrette for the grilled asparagus.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A few eggs from my mother's rebirth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Done.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Didn't take us 10 minutes, but we have four courses.  This is like three Michelin stars, chef.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Oh, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Perfect.  Look at that.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And that egg.  What an egg.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you eat like this all the time?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  I bring my kids up here.  All the staff comes here often. This becomes your reference frame for how fresh an asparagus should be?  Just harvest.  Just cooked.  Just eat them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When I think a place like this, in addition to being the best restaurant in the world and whatever else, it offers a real possibility that there is food around that with a little effort, or a lot of effort, you can make into something really delicious.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  That is the hard thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  To change the way that people think about food.  Not just the 35 people that can afford to come and eat here at NOMA.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you for joining.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Thank you, chef.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's magnificent.  Yes.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are always going to be some people out there who hate the very idea of your existence.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  From the very minute they even think about you.  There's a Danish expression for not wanting to stand out.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not wanting to talk about yourself.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.  That's called Jante law.  The law of Jante.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With yeast.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeast broth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's beautiful.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Here we are 10 years ago, we're opening, we're saying we're going to try something else.  Stuff like that in that time was just unheard of.  It was beyond stupid.  And why do you even try?  Why are you fiddling with stupid concepts?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a broth of wild lobster claws.  And (INAUDIBLE) petals.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Look at this.  This is very complex.  I know in the beginning, a lot of Danes were calling him the (INAUDIBLE).  They were laughing at him.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  It's a very new thing.  You know, food here in Denmark. It's not something that they have, like, we have in Italy or they have in France.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  No, here, it's a different story.  You have a huge part of people that are still so much in love with the old world.  I mean, I've even been told that I have fascist tendencies.  There's been op- eds written in Danish papers linking what we do at the restaurant to some of the most horrible moments in recent history.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the tail of the lobster, with a little bit of the head juices underneath (INAUDIBLE) leaves.  Use your hands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I will.  It's luxurious.  So how is it changing?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  That's what's interesting.  In 10 years, it's really gone from, you know sealed to igniting a new confidence in this city, in this part of the world that I never grew up with.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A possible forebearer to this new challenging of the status quo can be found right in the heart of this great-laced Danish capital.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think Christiania is one of the most awesome places in the world which is not very gantalorish to say.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The well established enclave of hippie, anarchists, squatters.  Sounds about as attractive as being sentenced to life at a fish concert.  But there are some interesting features of Christiania.\\n\\nThere's no government to intrude on your personal freedom.  You're free to behave as eccentric or a normal a fashion as you wish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here, I mean, you can be the freak that you are, and if you want to spend your day talking to a tree, you can do that without being frowned upon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Razinga and his friend Joker are in local government, such as it is.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Christania has been here for some 40 years.  It was a military area that was abandoned and then occupied by squatters and hippies.  Despite the fact that the different governments didn't really appreciate what was going on here, nobody actually had the will or strength to put people out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who makes up the traction?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about the essentials?  You know, electric, water.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We buy it from providers.  But we do it as a commune, it's collective, we pay only one bill.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But what I like about living here is the fact that my kids get to walk around the streets without worrying about being run over by a car.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's no hot roads.  No cars running in the streets.  I mean, it's like a little village.  It's very secure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you a hippie?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He is.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got two eggs smoking now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, chef.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So right down there, we have Pusher Street, which is probably the most famous part of Christiania.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The green section, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You buy weed and hash oil, hashish.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I would never do that as a responsible journalist, but I'm interested in investigating it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPusher Street.  It is a beloved institution here.  You are free to try an array of cannabis products.\\n\\nTheoretically, by the way, marijuana is, like, not legal in Denmark.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But there's a great tolerance for marijuana here and I think that's because it isn't really harmful.  People who smoke too much, maybe they pass out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Quail egg cooked.  Wow.  That's like the greatest thing ever.  That's a perfect dish.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Perfect dish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I want more of those.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So here you go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  So there's nobody in charge.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am.  I'm in charge.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  The only problem is everybody else is, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  It seems utopia.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have the same problems as anybody, but we try to solve them in a different way.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And one of the ways we try to solve the sort of challenges is by embracing people as much as we can.  And trying to make space as much as we can.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do we have two peas ready for table four?  Can I go over that now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Extraordinary.  I was reading something that's very un- American in its concept, which is don't be afraid to fail.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.  When we did this issue, to us it was a very big moment.  Because we burnt it by mistake.  And then, we thought OK, it's a mistake.  Let's see what happens.  We cooked it.  Then we had a new spice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's indescribably delicious.  All cook books, particularly American cook books, are written from the point of view that if you only follow this recipe, it will turn out great.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You're safe.  This is what we try to talk about every day in the kitchen with the cooks on Saturday Night Projects.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Apparently this is when you invite members of your crew to put up a new dish for comment.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After each grueling workweek concludes, cooks from every level of the brigade stay late to submit their newest culinary ideas. Everybody's in on this?  REDZEPI:  Everybody's in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This could be a very uncomfortable -- you're heading it out.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  This forum is about failure.  So yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  Let's see what you got.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Luke, go for it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In no point in my career would I have wanted to subject myself to this kind of mass scrutiny.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  No, but watch.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It can be bad.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I have for you, chef, are fermented apple tea.  This one I did with razor clam and some chamomile as well.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is lamb's tongue.  Cooked for 10 hours in 70 degrees.  It just ferments in water and 2 percent salt.  And this is (INAUDIBLE) fondue with brown butter.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So what we have here is ice cream with some barley.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mushroom ice cream and fermented barley sauce.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think the lamb's tongue is a great ingredient. Personally I'm not getting what they call robbery brought to the party.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  The razor clams are a bit sweet.  And with this broth, it's quite sweet.  So it becomes very one-dimensional.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why can't you do that for your next project?  Dry salt versus brine salt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He uses things that I would never use in a desert.  And it tastes good.  I like it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Given a choice of a traditional dessert and this, I'm very, very, very happy with this.  I think it's delicious.  Really.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Thank you.  Who's next?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So here we have a dish of strawberries and cream. I just decided to go on my bike and see what I could get.  So all the flowers that are here, the lady let me pick them in her garden.  So I have strawberries that are pickled in rose vinegar.  And the creme fresh at the base that's been infused with burnt roses and rose pollen.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do we just clap or --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And then that might well end up on the menu?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  No.  This is not about putting things on the menu.  No.  I mean, if somebody makes a masterpiece, it's their masterpiece.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes, yes.  Of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Isn't it your historical imperative as the chef to take his good work and innovation and put it on the menu and take credit for it as your own?  I mean, that's the way it's been done for centuries.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  This is not the point here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The pursuit of enlightenment and knowledge is its own reward?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  To me, yes.\\n\\nIs that it?  Cheers, everybody.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Table four is being cleared.  Let's start dressing.  They're waiting.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, chef.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  I mean now I travel a lot.  You know, I want to be number one in the world.  I was in Mexico, the Yucatan.  They don't even know how to make a tortilla.  They don't even know what a tortilla is made of.  They come to lose touch with what tradition is.  That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Merci, chef.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  It's good for you to try this, the herring, the rye bread, the smoked fish, the traditional stuff.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You know, because when you grow up as a cook here, you think of this as old fashion.  We don't see it as an inspiration for your future endeavors as a cook.\\n\\nAll right.  Fellows, the next thing we serve you is flat bread.  Very traditional here.  And we spice ours with chutes of spruce and oak tree.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  This is amazing.  Amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  That's good.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Sophistication.  But it's something that is so down to earth flavor-wise.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No doubt about it.  That seems both really classic and totally new.\\n\\nHow are you doing?  How are you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hello.  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nI'm learning, Danes may be stiff, but they sure as hell know how to drink.  Nils is a Danish renaissance man.  Drinker, sailor, charter tour boat operator, musician.\\n\\nSo you're a neighbor of Rene.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have known him from the absolute beginning.  And when NOMA -- can we start now?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Yes, we're going.  Well, what did you think of him when you first met him?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I saw an ordinary man.  He fight for what he think about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He had a vision.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, a vision.  He have a vision and fight for this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nicely done, chef.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There we are.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at the beautiful girl there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gammel Dansk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What's in it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's Gammel Dansk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is that?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't know exactly how you make that.  But it has been drinking in Denmark for many years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So we have Gammel Dansk.  It's a Danish bitter that has about 30 different herbs or so.  So we made an ice cream with dehydrated milk and (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, here we go.  Gammel Dansk.  It is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It works.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It works.  It works.  Look at this.  Where you come from, New York?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you know?  What?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It works.  He says.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They are perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What would traditional Danish food be for you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Potatoes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two potatoes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And some kind of meat and sauce.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you taste the sauce?  Yes?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Hello, fellows.  We fermented barley, and we cooked the potatoes in that and served with sturgeon roll from the lakes.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It has homemade whiskey -- I know the flavor well.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we go.  What are we doing?  I'm a little bit hungry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There was a famous Danish national late-night dish.\\n\\nJohn's Hotdog?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I'll have the deluxe.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This one's an organic sausage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Organic sausage?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Made with wild garlic and bacon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sounds good to me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He made his own mustard.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Onions are pickled in beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's a classic one.\\n\\nAll my happiest moments seem to revolve around meat in two forms. That's superb.  It's really good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't thrill me when I eat that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Only the moments when you look good.  These onions are awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that's the way.  You have to make something new.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But respect the classics.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  This is what we should transmit to the young guys.  The passion to present something on a plate that is delicious, also make sense of your own environment, something that is yours.  If you don't have a clear (INAUDIBLE) one's tradition, how can you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come to Copenhagen, NOMA for lunch, John's for dinner.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And Gammel Dansk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just across from NOMA, located in a converted houseboat, an entity separate from the restaurant.  The place where Rene set up to further ideas and experimentation.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Ben is one of the guys in charge here.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nutmeg is a bit of a hallucinogenic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So I decided to make something (INAUDIBLE) rich but also nutmeg.  Leave it for a while and then we'll see what happens.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it's hallucinogenic fish sauce potentially?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In theory.  Some of the things that we're doing, really, I mean, they are just pure experimentation for experimentation's sake.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  And it's pretty damn delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like that.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  It's another food item on your shelf.  And me as a cook, that's what I want.  These are two years old cherries with the cherry pits.  And wild roses, five years old wild roses.  Very deep, intense.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  This is amazing.  Amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But they're just talking about what taste good, now they're talking about will this taste good in two years if you ferment it or age it or dry it.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  We like to ferment it.  We add bacteria to it, so that it needs three years of time, and then it becomes ultra delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The diversity available to us, you're looking at fermentations, you're looking at different bacteria, looking at different molds, yeast, all sorts.  It's absolutely enormous.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is stuff rotting in jars, these experiments of fermentation and flavor.  You're all doing some sinister -- down there.  I know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So this is the ferment of canapodium, a wild type of spinach which grows around here.  And no one uses them.  Maybe even reminiscent of (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Serious (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nREDZEPI:  And this is from a weed that grows everywhere.  If you do it with gooseberries.  Like to ferment gooseberries.  You get golden drops of perfection.\\n\\nCan we have two berries on four?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  All right, fellas.  The next thing we serve you is the dried in juices from last year's harvest of black currant, and then we wrap it in wild roses that we've had in vinegar for two years.  PORCHELI:  Acidity.  Creamy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's like superpower.\\n\\nI need to ask about this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You need to ask about this.  Well, this is pretty interesting.  This is born out of a desire to study mummification. Everyone used to eat mummies, apparently.  They were considered a panacea.  So this has been cured with resins, alcohol, spices, with honey, with (INAUDIBLE).  All kinds of things that would have been used --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- in a mummification and embalming process. Let's taste it.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Let's take it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here you go.  So it's quite moldy.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  You mean that in a (INAUDIBLE) way.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't know.  I mean, it's an experiment.  You know, like -- I mean it's a six-month-old piece of raw deer.  So I suppose it's somewhat inevitable.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It's not unpleasant.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Interesting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tastes like Egyptian.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nREDZEPI:  We just have one project funded.  Deliciousness is an argument for (INAUDIBLE).  So deliciousness is an argument for eating insects.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we have grilled onions and fermented pears. And salt made out of wood ants.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wood ants.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Wood ants.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cool.  That's delicious.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  It's amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, some of the ants we've been experimenting with.  It's like you eat it, it's like zing, it's like excitement in your mouth.  Everyone is invited.  The other ones, they need a lot of work.  Here we've got wax moth larvae mousse (INAUDIBLE) which is with hazel nut and then you've got (INAUDIBLE) sauce.  This is bee larvae.  Like little lumps of fat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This tastes like insects.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Next taste, fermented fish, herrings.  We stuffed them with molded greens.  And these have been here since January.  So it's been filtered and then put with juniper and with (INAUDIBLE) berries, a little squirt of aged apple vinegar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  That's delicious.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  That's good, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That's lethally good.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I can think of 10 different ways I'd like to eat that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Standing up, sitting down, with beer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being fed.  So it takes awhile to stumble across these things.  But slowly but surely they come out of the woodwork.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's have some great fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers, guys.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers, guys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mid-summer's day.  Longest day of the year.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Danes to mark the mid-summer's eve gather and partake in traditions.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the sun comes out, we salute you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like a joined picnics, building bonfires.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  There's the fire.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nREDZEPI:  There's going to be a fire.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And burning witches.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We made those fires back in the days to keep the witches away.  Because they thought all the witches was meeting on this solstice.\\n\\nOK, where's the pork?\\n\\nREDZEPI:  This is the roast pork.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very traditional.  Without this the Danes could not live.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So we have pork skin and chocolate.  With freeze-dried blackberries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You guys enjoy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  Wow, that's wild.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  That's wild.  It's the flavor of Denmark, right?  Roast pork with (INAUDIBLE), red cabbage, pickles.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is a serious sandwich.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThat's just amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, a rainbow.  This is almost too pretty.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAnd there you go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Super cool, huh?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why don't we have the strawberries?  With triple cream, huh?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's delicious, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So we have wild blueberry desserts.  So the sandwich, one for each of you.  And the first of the wild strawberries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Look at this.  Like a picnic in the park, yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So the mid-summer day in Denmark.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Look at the witch.  Burn, witch, burn.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You done?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Terrific, thank you.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  Unbelievable.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look, I've eaten at a lot of great restaurants around the world, and there was still a little part of me that was saying, you know, this is going to be bull --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThe guy's out in the field yanking weeds out of the ground.  I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  It was delicious.  It was amazingly delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I thought it was amazing.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  It's not just about coming up with the greatest concept. It's just assembling what is out there in a new and beautiful, authentic and delicious way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He has single-handedly transformed everybody's understanding of Nordic cuisines.\\n\\nPORCHELI:  With all the dishes, they all tell a little bit of a story. You know, of the land, the tradition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But always delicious.  Always, always, always delicious first.  You may be an ordinary guy, grounded, comes from a poor family.  But he has big dreams.  He wants to change the world.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  And we can change it.  Never forget that. We can do that.\\n\\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Good evening.  I'm Anderson Cooper.\\n\\nIt was a hot summer afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Into a small branch bank stepped a man wearing a white T-shirt and what he said was a bomb strapped underneath.

       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  A petri dish for talent, for culture, the great unknown.  Go look.  B.X. (ph), home again.\\n\\nI know you\\'re a man who can help me.\\n\\nSometime in mid-19th century 1850s, my great-great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, emigrated to South America.  He was reported to have died here; might have been a seeker of Utopian dreams.  You know, my aunt used to tell stories he was into arms smuggling or who knows, you know?  No idea.\\n\\n(THEME SONG)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For most people, Paraguay is an empty space on the map of Latin America.  A country of only six million where a vast percentage of the land is steaming hot jungle or a huge scrub desert known simple as the Chaco.  Only a few large cities offer a respite from the impressive heat.\\n\\nA thousand miles upriver from the Atlantic Ocean sits Asuncion, Paraguay\\'s remote capitol city,  Known largely for being a post-war refuge for fleeing Nazis and a long line of extremely unpleasant dictators, this place, of all the places in the world, is where my great-great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, disappeared without explanation sometime in the 1850s.\\n\\nI\\'m told you\\'re a man who can help me.\\n\\nHow do you do?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  May I call you Tony?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Please.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re here for the first time in the country?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First time in Paraguay, yes.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Lido Bar in Asuncion has always been like the central switchboard.  A gathering place.  Ladies in orange vests cook and serve old-school Paraguayan working-class food to people from every walk of life.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This place is very unique in Asuncion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'ve been here for more than 50 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  Let\\'s get something to eat.  I\\'m hungry.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Empanadas de carne: big envelopes of dough  , filled with beef, onion, and hard-cooked egg, deep fried to perfection. Cattle is the big business of this country.  It used to be cattle and smuggling.  These days it\\'s still cattle and some smuggling.  You see a lot of beef is what I\\'m saying.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh, that\\'s good.\\n\\nThis country is a mystery to most people.  What little we know of the country generally comes from Nazis and Germans hiding in Paraguay from war crimes.  Do you think that\\'s an undeserved reputation?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t think -- I don\\'t think it\\'s fair. Paraguay is a nice country.  A beautiful country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Pedro is a private investigator, one of a team of people I sent out looking for the mysterious lost Bourdain.\\n\\n(on camera):  What kind of investigations are you called upon to do?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Normally counterfeiting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is sort of the counterfeiting capital of the world. In the old days it\\'s said much of this counterfeiting had partners in the government.  Not so much anymore?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'d rather don\\'t -- don\\'t answer that.  I mean, I\\'m -- I\\'m not a politician here, so...\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  General Alfredo Stroessner was the last of his kind in Paraguay.  Of German heritage, he ruled the country until 1989 with a quiet, Bavarian charm, but behind the scenes was another thing.\\n\\nUtilizing an outfit of S.S.-trained secret police referred to as the hairy footed ones, he tortured and tossed dissidents out of helicopters over the jungle.  The list goes on.  Under Stroessner, one in four Paraguayans is said to have cooperated, willingly or not, as paid informers on their fellow citizens.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s quite a history in this country.  Crazy, tragic, violent.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let me put it this way.  Things are changing, a lot.  And now things are getting (UNINTELLIGIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sometime in the mid-19th Century, 1850s, Jean Bourdain emigrated to South America, first in Argentina but apparently came here.  That\\'s really almost all I know for sure.\\n\\nDid he die by the sword?  Did he die of old age?  Did he die of syphilis?have no idea.  I\\'d like to know.  I would like to find a grave site.  That would be great.  You know, my\\n\\nfather died at 57.  His father in, I think, 20 -- in his 20s, I believe.  I\\'ll be 58 in June.  I think I am the longest living male Bourdain in possibly ever.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So you\\'re lonely in the world?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I am lonely in the world, yes.  If I could solve the mystery of the elusive Jean Bourdain it would make me very happy.\\n\\nBy the way, it would be terrific if you found out that he owned a huge ranch in the Chaco, and they\\'ve been waiting for his relatives to claim his property.  Maybe not.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to make some sense of this country.  You\\'ve lived here how long?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m -- 22 years.  Too long maybe.  What a strange and nice country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Go to Paraguay, find a German to show you around.  Not so crazy or unrepresentative.  People came to this country from everywhere to, as Emerson called it, make their own world.\\n\\n(on camera):  Peter, I\\'m Tony.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nice to meet you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what\\'s good to eat here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I suppose you want something Paraguay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bife Koygua (ph).  It\\'s roast rice with fried beef with an egg on top.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m there.  Good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And there\\'s a soup whose name is Bori Bori that\\'s very, very old Paraguayan stuff.  Little corn balls.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks good.  That looks very good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s good, man.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to make some sense of this country.  You lived here how long?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Twenty-two years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why did you come here in the first place? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was born in East Germany, and East Germany, that\\n\\nmeans you would never go out.  Yes, and then in \\'89 the wall break down and you say, \"Wow,\" you will go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I haven\\'t seen anything of this country yet, but what I read was that the world\\'s back water filled with bombed-out banks that had been looted, institutions that didn\\'t work.  Everyone carried a gun.  It was like the wild west but poorer.  It\\'s not that anymore?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A bit of this is true.  I by myself got a .45 on my head last week.  That\\'s pretty common stuff for me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Seldom in the history of the world have I seen any country where, one after the other, you\\'ve had absolutely the most maniacal, insane, suicidal group of piss-pot dictators century after century.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are right.  Even in the Stroessner times the better part of Paraguayans was behind him.  Paraguayans are very, very easy to influence.  And business, I believe, unchanged until a short time ago.  Now there is a growing middle class.  Better education than before and that makes the people say no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How was the soup?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I liked it, yes.  It was the way my wife cooks it. I like it better with chicken.  But chicken is more for Saturday.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Paraguay was a very poor country.  The Spaniards came because they thought there was a lot of silver in the area.  They found nothing, so they lost interest in Paraguay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is the only country of Latin America where the indigenous language is the official language.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They talk Guarani automatically.  I am married to a Paraguayan woman, and when her fathers come in they automatically talk Guarani, and I\\'m more or less out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A proudly mestizo society.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Was it de Francia?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  El Supremo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  El Supremo, got to love it.\\n\\n(voice-over):  A nearly 200-year succession of dictators began in 1811 when Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia declared himself El Supremo for life.  De Francia insisted Paraguay become a mestizo, mixed race society.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Paraguayans are neither Spanish nor Indians.  We are mestizos.  El Supremo forbid marriage between whites and whites. He produced mestizos by force.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Today 95 percent of Paraguayans are of mixed Spanish and Guarani blood.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And we usually speak the two languages.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nThis is the central market?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mercado Quatro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Quatro.  This is the big one?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The biggest one, the most popular one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m hungry.  What\\'s good here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We opted for the soup from the mandi efish (ph). It\\'s a little catfish.  And OK, the saying is that it makes man very powerful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah.\\n\\nWhat\\'s he got over there?  That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gnocchi and stew.  There was a good Italian influence in Paraguay.  So maybe this stew comes from this side. Colonists from all over the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you invite them and give them the catfish stew?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you pass me the Sopa Paraguaya, the Paraguayan soup?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That soup?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The soup is very unique.\\n\\nOur dictator Lopez, his favorite soup was corn soup, and one day he ordered his favorite soup and the cook, when he opened the pot it was a cake.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Paraguay has not been noted for its history of kinder, gentler leaders.  In the 1800s, two generations of Lopez, father and son, one dictator after the other, certainly left their marks on this country.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lopez was pretty much known that-- for putting a wrong stamp on a letter, you get shot.  So the cook didn\\'t want to get shot.  He showed up in front of Lopez and said, \"This is Paraguayan soup, Sopa Paraguayan,\" and the dictator ate it and he liked it.  And a bit later the entire country eat it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s cheesy cornbread?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Awesome.  Good meal.\\n\\nSo this was the house or one of the houses of the notorious Madam Lynch.\\n\\nGUIDO RODRIGUEZ ALCALA, JOURNALIST/POET/AUTHOR:  Right.  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Journalist, poet, and author Guido Rodriguez Alcala has written books on Paraguay\\'s history.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now who exactly was Madam lynch.  A murky background, would you say?\\n\\nALCALA:  There\\'s talk about that.  Somebody say she was a great woman or that she was a very evil one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  She came over on the famous trip from France.\\n\\nALCALA:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Succeeding de Francia in 1840s, Lopez Sr. reversed many of Paraguay\\'s isolationist policies.  He invited foreigners to settle here and built one of South America\\'s first railways, its steam engines taken out of service only a few years ago. And he sent his son, Francisco Solano Lopez, to Europe.\\n\\n(on camera):  His mission, his father sent him out to get, what, arms?\\n\\nALCALA:  Arms and technicians, engineers and machinery.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Junior, by most contemporary accounts, was an idiot.\\n\\n(on camera):  So he came back with a mistress, Madam lynch.\\n\\nALCALA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which dad wasn\\'t too happy about?\\n\\nALCALA:  Right.\\n\\nHe was very traditional and wanted his son to marry a Paraguayan woman and do everything by the book.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Paraguay\\'s soon-to-be first mistress, Madam Eliza Lynch, was the already-married daughter of an Irish doctor. Ambitious, social climbing, fond of nice things.\\n\\nALCALA:  Clothes imported from France.  They say she brought the Paraguayans the (UNINTELLIGIBLE).  And there were parties here.\\n\\nHe showed Madam Lynch to his father and his father was upset, so she was put aside.  And... BOURDAIN:  Kept as a mistress.\\n\\nALCALA:  And that was the way Paraguayan society tried to treat her, and she wanted to be treated as the...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Princess?\\n\\nALCALA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tell me about Madam Lynch\\'s famous boat trip.\\n\\n(voice-over):  On one of her more notorious adventures as hostess, Madam Lynch organized a grand outing to the new French colony at Nouveau Bordeaux.\\n\\n(on camera):  She invited all of society to join her.\\n\\nALCALA:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  A magnificent river steamer was engaged for the party.\\n\\nALCALA:  And well, there were some issues between the Paraguayan ladies and Madam Lynch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once on board, as the story goes, those mean bitches treated their hostess like so much trash.\\n\\nALCALA:  And so she got upset and threw over board all of the food which they were supposed to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  She had it all thrown in the river?\\n\\nALCALA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Then she ordered the captain to stop the boat and let her guests just sit there in that jungle heat for hours.\\n\\n(on camera):  Throwing tubs of caviar and whole roasted pigs into the river in front of these starving aristocrats?  Somehow that pleases me.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Going back to the very beginnings, various groups with stars in their eyes came here seeking to create a utopia along ideological lines, a Mennonite paradise.  Repopulate Latin America with Aryan Germans.  British, Italians, I mean, you had everybody.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nIt started with the Jesuit colonies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  New Bordeaux.\\n\\nI had a great-great-great-grandfather come over to Paraguay around the 1850s.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Might have been, himself, a seeker of some kind of utopian dreams.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They were originally from France?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  From France, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What city?  Do you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My great-great-grandfather was from near Bordeaux.  So I\\'m curious about this whole episode of the settlement of Nouveau Bordeaux.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The Paraguay River still, as it was 150 years ago, the country\\'s main artery.  A thoroughfare for transporting people and goods.\\n\\n(on camera):  So who lives out there?\\n\\nAll the people we see fishing on the river banks, are they fishing for dinner?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Most of them are fishing for dinner.  They call them poor (ph) people.  But what it\\'s for, they decide by themselves to live here.  They could go to Asuncion and start working on a construction place tomorrow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Peter has organized a trip up river to see New Bordeaux, what was hoped would be a new France in the Chaco.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The fish we bought today, 14 kilo, that\\'s half a month\\'s salary, and you get with a bit of good luck in one night.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Outside of the cities Paraguay is, of course, sparsely populated.  Indigenous groups, a few settled Europeans, Mennonites, Germans and very so often, a fishing lure and shotgun salesman.\\n\\n(on camera):  Peter, what are the shotguns for?  Bandits?  Varmints? What?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To hunt deer and water pig.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a peacemaker.\\n\\nAny rogue Nazis we can shoot now?\\n\\n(voice-over):  I am tempted by the offer of a cheap shotgun for sale. Figures Peter would know this guy, but reason wins out.\\n\\n(on camera):  I don\\'t think we\\'re going to buy a shotgun today.\\n\\nMe, fear, shotgun, hot sunny day, a producer.  That\\'s not a good mix.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Unlike Madam Lynch\\'s guests, I\\'m making damn sure I\\'m eating on this boat trip.\\n\\n(on camera):  The most important part of any meal.  Cold, frosty beverages.  I started early.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nHere we go.  Thank you.  A little fish and a mango salsa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have the two most appreciated fish here on the table of Paraguay.  That\\'s the catfish torabi (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And that\\'s the...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s the Dorado.  The golden fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, the Dorado, of course.  Yes.  Ooh, that\\'s tasty.  Ooh, that\\'s nice.\\n\\nSo I\\'m curious about this whole episode of the settlement of Nouveau Bordeaux.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There came about 400 people.  There were supposed to be about 1,000.  They were supposed to be most of them farmers. But just 86 were farmers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who were the other people?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They were tailors.  They were shoemakers. Musicians.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Teachers and artists.  And they were put in the jungle and left by himself.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Why here of all of the places in the world?  People talk about the Chaco as a hell.  I mean, it\\'s hot here -- it\\'s dry, it\\'s red, (inaudible), it\\'s difficult.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have all the mosquitoes.  You have all the ticks (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A flatland of cactus and thorns and misery and cannibals (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There were the Indians, the Guajaguru (ph) coming down the river and killing everybody.  There was the Lengua (ph), who, if you enter their country, you are good food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did the Paraguayans ever see this as a utopia?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, I\\'m sure not.\\n\\nWhat we have (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  That\\'s kind of not how I pictured it.  Doesn\\'t look like Bordeaux to me.\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing much left of Nouveau Bordeaux.  I\\'m told a small museum of artifacts.  The site where the colony once briefly existed is now called Viahars (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (inaudible) money for each settler.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Perhaps there was a communication breakdown somewhere and he might have told the Paraguayans I\\'m bringing you the finest farmers France has to offer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And he might have told these Frenchmen, oh, they\\'re going to give you free property.  You don\\'t have to do anything.  You\\'ll live like kings.  Just reach up in the trees and fruit and gold bars are dropping.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In fact, they were thrown out on the coast and say, here you are.  That\\'s your land.  Go ahead.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These poor French guys show up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lopez Sr. and the government kept their side of the bargain.  They provided them with houses, equipment.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, right.  Tours and animals and everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Needs to have one of these.  Makes pressed sandwiches, I think.  And that\\'s it.  Dig, grow.\\n\\nThe settlers quickly discovered that farming is hard work, and that the conditions in the Chaco (ph) in no way resembled the New France of their dreams.\\n\\nThat\\'s a big snake.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So they get broke and they decide to leave the colony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many French were left at the end of the New Bordeaux experiment?  Did any stay?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of them but few.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any thoughts or hopes that Jean Bourdain ended his life here, leaving me a vast unclaimed stake in what is now prime cattle country turns quickly to dust.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you guys have some information perhaps on the elusive Jean Bourdain, I hear?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what he did here.  Of course I\\'m hoping for something extremely glamorous.  A river pirate, a gun runner, drug smuggler. Maybe he died in the saddle.  Maybe he died happy.  Maybe he was like Colonel Kurtz, living out in the bush, surrounded by adoring indigenous women.  I don\\'t know.  You know, if he was a masseur for Madam Lynch, I guess I would be let down.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I had contact with another historians and genealogists around the world, and the history of your family is very interesting.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay.\\n\\nInteresting.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, your family, your grandfather Jean Bourdain came to Montevideo following the sun (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay, the facts as I know them so far, I think are this. My great, great, granddad, Jean, his son also named Jean, came to Montevideo, Uruguay, to live with his uncle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  1850, Jean Bourdain moves to Asuncion.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is the document that we have showing him arriving.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There he is.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In that time, he worked with a chapelier (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With a hat maker.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A hat maker?  I\\'m pretty sure he said hat maker, which I have to say disappoints me, like a lot.  The whole elusive wing of mysterious South American Bourdains were \"Project Runway\" contestants of their day?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In 1855 Lopez\\'s son arrives to Asuncion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  With Madam Lynch.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With Madam Lynch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Madam Lynch was fond of things like French couture.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes, and that changed the way of dress in Asuncion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Madam Lynch might have been good for business.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to put this in a light I can be enthusiastic about.  Like how clearly forward thinking my relatives were.\\n\\nHis customers, as a hat maker.  The very people that treated Madam Lynch with such utter contempt, did they live in the colonial homes? The old mansions that we see still in Asuncion, that type of residence?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Times were changing in South America too in those days. Society ladies craved the latest au courant French fashion.  There was money to be made.\\n\\nI\\'m bummed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  After this episode with the New Bordeaux group came the Triple Alliance War.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jean Bourdain died in 1858.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Before.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was a good time to die, because this way he wouldn\\'t have had to join this horrible war.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He missed the war?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nThe old Lopez died.  The young Lopez got in power.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our man becomes president.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, Francisco Lopez.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Absolutely the most maniacal, megomaniacal piss pot (ph) dictator.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He was rather unkind to his siblings.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  His two brothers were tortured and killed, and the sisters were jailed.  Taken into tiger cages.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tiger cages.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tiger cages.  And the mother was given some beating.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  60-something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The 60 something-year-old mother was flogged and beaten in front of him.  Not a nice man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He believed that he had a chance to get married with the daughter of the emperor of Brazil.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s right.  He was refused in very unflattering terms.\\n\\nThanks presumably to Lopez Jr.\\'s expansionist ambitions, he dragged Paraguay into the Triple Alliance War.\\n\\nHe essentially challenged all three neighbors.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To war.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t seem like a good idea.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In what would become the bloodiest war in Latin America\\'s history, hundreds of thousands of Paraguayans died.  When Lopez ran out of adults, he sent children into the field, dressed only in rags, armed with sticks painted to look like guns.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My great grandfather was a 10-year-old boy, and he was dressed like a girl (ph) because otherwise he was going to be enrolled into the army.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lopez eventually was hunted down.  Madam Lynch survived.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  She survived.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But with her money, I mean, was she allowed to keep her possessions?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In history it\\'s hard to find a more disastrous or more cruel or a pointless campaign, it would seem.\\n\\nWhen all was said and done, as much as 60 percent of the population and 90 percent of the men of this country were dead.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The survivors were just like 50,000 or 40,000 people.\\n\\nSo that\\'s why you could easily understand why there was nothing here for 100 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jean Bourdain dies here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Before the (inaudible).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An adult natural of France by the name of Juan Bourdain.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Cause of death?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not specified here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there a grave site?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We\\'re looking.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are looking for it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So I\\'m hungry.  I\\'m really hungry.\\n\\nYou know you want it.  It\\'s late.  You\\'ve had a few.  No, you had a lot.  You want something greasy, savory, juicy and nasty.\\n\\nThis is it.  Palentiveri lavido (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  That\\'s what today\\'s people eat in the streets of Asuncion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An egg, a little runny please.  Some kind of meat, like beef patty thing.  Throw on your lettuce and tomato.  Two sauces -- no idea what they are, and frankly don\\'t care.  Soy sauce I think too. Of course, because, yes.  And like the ruins of ancient Troy, egg on top of cheese on top of meat.  Now get in my stomach now.\\n\\nSandwich is awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Awesome good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good awesome.  All my greasy meat dreams have come true, that\\'s good.  And at the last moment, the last thing I give a steaming loaf about anymore is my long dead relatives -- I mean, I am over it. Here comes news of the big breakthrough.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I talked with the historian and he said it looks like your great grandfather, what he was merchandising, it was definitely not hats.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have here Jean Bourdain.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And what is he bringing?  200 boxes of fireworks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fireworks?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fireworks. BOURDAIN:  Like fire crackers?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is not even more than 200 or 300 wealthy families who sometimes in a birthday would crack a little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So are you suggesting something untoward?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Weapons.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Weapons?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He was a merchant of death?  Awesome.  You know, my aunt always said he was a gun runner.  We figured she was full of shit.  I mean, she also said she was in the Resistance, you know, but everybody in France said that.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, arms?  So was he ever a hat-maker? Or was that just a cover job?  Was he a hat maker/arms?\\n\\nAre all these local researchers, historians and geniuses on the money here?  Was great great great grampy an arms dealer?\\n\\nWhat hat makers needs 200 tons of gun powder?  I\\'ve got you now, Jean Bourdain.  I\\'ve got you now.\\n\\nOr was he simply a party supplier, selling fine French hats and little firecrackers to school kids?  I don\\'t know what to believe.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And in \\'58, unfortunately, he died.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And he was buried, here, two miles from here, in La Coletta (ph), the rich people\\'s cemetery.  We can pretty well say on which area he remains.\\n\\nHe is there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Well, I guess we\\'ll have to go look, huh?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Definitely.  Yeah.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sorry, little buddy.  There\\'s no escaping it.  Paraguay loves their beef.  It\\'s a perfect ratio, a lot of meat, little bit of vegetables.  Oh, whoa, that\\'s good.\\n\\nThis is the Via Stanzia Corrarodeo (ph), a sprawling ranch bigger than some of the countries I\\'ve traveled to, and it\\'s been in the family going all the way back to the Triple Alliance War.\\n\\nHard life?  Or a good life?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, we are pretty happy.  We have everything.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  20 years ago, the (inaudible) was not used.  In the last years, it\\'s booming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where does the boom come from?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are the second biggest soybean exporter, the eighth biggest cattle exporter.  Paraguay feeds the entire world for eight days a year.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many acres?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  100,000.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  100,000 hectares.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Barbecue has to be included --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Toriso morsia (ph), I could eat this all day.  And I will.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With (ph) barbecue.  You are complete.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mmm, that\\'s awesome.  So were there a lot of vegetarians in this part of Paraguay?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There comes the what is for the Paraguayans the highlight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, look at that.  Pretty.  Beef short ribs are amazing. Mmm, so good.\\n\\nAll of the books I read about Paraguay are maybe 15 years old.  And like the first advice is, everybody has a gun, buy a gun.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This was not the Paraguay I expected at all.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s different.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He wants to sing a song for you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A welcome song.  To the foreign people.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It says -- it not says \"welcome, stranger.\"  It says \"welcome, brother stranger.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jean Bourdain who died here in Asuncion was my great great great grandfather.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This old cemetery.  La Coletta (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It seems most likely that he was buried there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nobody I know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s very, very likely that the tomb was just overbuilt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Something on top.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (on camera):  This is a good place to both experience fantasy and reality.  The air, explosives and food?  You can\\'t beat that.  So you just stand here in the street, and random strangers bring you delicious foods.  It\\'s a great country.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Colombia.  Ordinarily and, for all too many years, when this country makes the news or appears in a film or television drama, it\\'s not for its looks, which are, I should say right up front, spectacular.  It\\'s not for its people who are, everyone I\\'ve ever met, anyway, warm, proud, generous and fun.  Or for its food, which is truly great.\\n\\n(On camera):  I don\\'t know what this is, but it\\'s good.  Food in this country is excellent.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  I\\'m no stranger to this place.  Generally speaking, it\\'s a particularly vibrant mix of Spanish, European, Afro-Caribbean, and indigenous people.  These are deep waters, my friends, that no news story or episode of \"Miami Vice\" has ever come close to navigating.\\n\\nIt is and always has been a fiercely, fiercely proud country, and its people yearn to see international coverage of something other than cocaine and violence, but that isn\\'t a legacy that\\'s easy to ignore.\\n\\nIts decades of civil unrest have left vast swaths of Colombia relatively unknown, even to its own citizens.  To reach a place previously considered a no-go area, I\\'ll fly out of an airport in Villavicencio, 45 miles southeast of the capital city of Bogota.\\n\\nOn first inspection, this is an airplane bone yard, where unwanted props from \"Romancing the Stone\" corrode artfully.  But in reality, this sleepy hangar is an important gateway to the more impenetrable parts of the country.  The remote settlements in the Amazon basin are cut off from the country, with neither rail nor roads connecting them. There are only two ways in, either boat for several days downriver, or aboard a jungle bus, which is what locals call the World War II era DC-3.\\n\\n(On camera):  I\\'ve flown worse.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  I\\'ve been brought here by Pablo Mora, a teacher at Medellin University and a particular enthusiast for this classic of golden age aviation.  (On camera):  You\\'ve taken this flight before?\\n\\nPABLO MORA, MEDELLIN UNIVERSITY:  Yes, every time I have a chance I come here and fly one.  It\\'s a romantic thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  He sees the work that these hulking great airships and their pilots do, as daredevil humanitarian missions for the more remote Colombians.\\n\\n(On camera):  They have an in-flight movie?\\n\\nMORA:  No, no, no.  Nor first class either.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What?\\n\\nMORA:  No, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The planes travel with their own mechanic to cobble together anything that might go wrong.  And stuff can go wrong. The risk is that we\\'ll be able to land but not take off again, so this guy is our return ticket out of the jungle.\\n\\nOur captain is Joaquin San Clement, something of a legend in these parts, and his copilot, Captain Costanza Reyes.\\n\\nMORA:  It\\'s mystical.  You know, and they develop this sensibility with the plane.  There\\'s no \"Intel Inside\" here.  There\\'s no software. They have GPS, but that\\'s about it.  It\\'s beautiful, you know, they have to sense everything.  They know when the sound of the plane is not right.  It\\'s just man and machine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The weather is the big unknown around here.  It\\'s changeable enough to ground planes in remote places if they hang around for too long.  We have to make one stop on the way to pick up more cargo.  Vital cargo, by the way.\\n\\nThe land we\\'re passing over is beautiful and lush.  But the life of those below has been anything but.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Colombia seems to be trapped in a vicious circle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  FARC has used the territory as a haven for kidnapping and drug --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Until recently most of the news coming out of this part of Colombia was not good.  It was a front line in the war on drugs, for lack of a better term, and Colombia\\'s long struggle with the FARC, a Marxist guerrilla force financed by drug trafficking, kidnapping and covert assistance from Venezuela.\\n\\nFifty years of a very dirty war.  The stakes not about drugs per se, but about the ability of ordinary Colombians to live without fear.\\n\\nWe land in the jungle outpost of Miraflores in the southern province of (INAUDIBLE) in the Amazonian Forest Reserve.  The heavy presence of army and special police is a result of its strategic location and recent history as a one-time center of cocoa production.\\n\\nFarmers here would grow the stuff and make leaves into paste. Traffickers would come and buy it.  The FARC had this area under its sphere of influence for years.  Nine years ago, the government moved to expel the FARC, the traffickers and any paramilitaries, with apparently much success.  Overnight, however, its population shrank by 85 percent.  And what remains struggles to survive.\\n\\n(On camera):  So people here, you\\'re telling me, they were born here? Or --\\n\\nMORA:  Most of the people came from elsewhere.  In the beginning, in the 1950s and \\'60s, they were -- they were escaping from the violence, from the political violence between the two parties in Colombia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if you were having problems in the city or wherever you were from, you came out here?\\n\\nMORA:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what did you do for a living out here?\\n\\nMORA:  Cattle and doing some other agriculture, and after that the drug trade, I think, began and everything with the coco plantations.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The climate is good for it?\\n\\nMORA:  Yes, it\\'s very good.  And since 1999, there was no police or army force here, so it was just occupied by the FARC.  And then by the farmers who tried to --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMORA:  So that\\'s when the real violence began.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So really the problems in this country preexisted the drug trade?\\n\\nMORA:  What we say here is that the drug trade just made everything more.  There\\'s no judge here.  There\\'s few institutions here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMORA:  Basically you know that the state is here just because the army is here.  So I think you\\'re going to meet the major.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMORA:  Anthony, this is the major.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Julio Cesar Gonzalez is the current mayor of Miraflores, which has seen much better and much worse days.\\n\\n(On camera):  How many people live in this town?\\n\\nMORA:  Around 1500 to 2,000 in the municipality.  The FARC were in here for 20 years.  And they were the central authority here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re running a subsystems farm (INAUDIBLE) plantains and not much else?  Not even particularly well, you know, you\\'re not particularly happy with the government, somebody comes along and offers you a nice machine gun and a cool scarf.\\n\\nMORA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Especially if you\\'re 15, 16 years old.\\n\\nMORA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a pretty attractive option.\\n\\nMORA:  Of course it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And even if they say you\\'ll probably be dead by the time you\\'re 25.\\n\\nMORA:  It is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come on.\\n\\nMORA:  It is.  And they offer you a salary.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what is the future of this town?\\n\\nJULIO CESAR GONZALEZ, MAYOR:  There are various programs from the state.  Now with the creation of the Department of Social Prosperity. One that is called Youth in Action that supports them with education.\\n\\nMORA:  They\\'re providing free education and there\\'s a lot of potential in biodiversity and ecotourism as well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What our people say is without the customer, there\\'s no -- there\\'s no cocaine trade and there\\'s no violence, right?  So if the United States and Europe stopped buying cocaine?\\n\\nMORA:  That\\'s so impossible.  I can\\'t think about it.  About the situation where the demand is not going to be there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But the demand in the states is down 40 percent.\\n\\nMORA:  As long as there is a market, there will be people ready to do it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The United States spends how many billions of dollars a year paying for guns and uniforms, training, et cetera.  Where should they be spending it?\\n\\nMORA:  I would say the health is very important, but more important is to end the war on drugs.  It just -- it doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s my problem.  If crack didn\\'t exist, I would have no -- I would absolutely agree with you, but as a former coke addict and as a former crackhead --  MORA:  Yes.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is a problem.\\n\\nMORA:  The thing is that people think that if you think that drugs should be legalized, you\\'re saying that they\\'re good.  No, they\\'re not saying that, but just -- we\\'re just getting rid of one problem.  The problem that the major has here.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re freeing up a lot of money that you could divert to this.\\n\\nMORA:  Yes, we have two problems.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m with you.  I agree.\\n\\nMORA:  One is drug addiction and the other is drug trafficking.  We can get rid of one, we\\'re not going to get rid of the other.  We have to deal with it forever.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a beautiful country.  The people here are -- from what I\\'ve been is really nice, even the bad guys are charming.\\n\\nMORA:  Yes.  Yes.  That is true.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The food is delicious.  The problem is the United States will never legalize drugs.  It will never happen.  It\\'s a complicated issue.\\n\\nMORA:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So the good people of this town could thank us for bringing their --\\n\\nMORA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- fresh supply of coca.  Cerveza, OK.\\n\\nThe thing now, gentlemen, it was really our pleasure.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Bogota, the country\\'s capital and an almost two-mile-high city with new lofty food ambitions, where previously a restaurant scene didn\\'t really exist.  Now young restaurateurs such as musician-turns-chef Tomas Rueda are beginning to make a name for themselves in Colombia.\\n\\nTHOMAS RUEDA, CHEF:  This is (INAUDIBLE).  It\\'s one of the biggest markets in Bogota.  I love this place.  It\\'s very beautiful.  The colors.  My mom comes here to buy flowers, my grandma also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did I mention that this city is over 8,000 feet up?  Hence the altitude sickness I\\'m feeling.  Not good.  Tomas comes here a few times a week for an early breakfast, which I\\'m hoping will make me feel better.  Paloquemao market has been running in one form or another since the 1940s.\\n\\n(On camera):  This place is huge.\\n\\nRUEDA:  You want some juice?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  What do you have?\\n\\nRUEDA:  I love orange juice with carrots.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s probably the healthiest thing I\\'ve had in a while.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Good for the high altitude.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nRUEDA:  This is better?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m feeling better every hour.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The first hour is killing me.\\n\\nRUEDA:  But you have a better face.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I didn\\'t think I was going to make it out of the airport.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nRUEDA:  Most of the mornings, early in the mornings, 5:00 to 6:00 in the morning, I climb the mountain.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Fresh air.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nRUEDA:  You have to come with me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hell no.  Ain\\'t happening.\\n\\nRUEDA:  You want to taste some arepa?  This arepa is made with corn. It\\'s fantastic, I love it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tucked away in the back corner of the fish market is a place that serves breakfast to the market\\'s workers and shoppers.  We\\'re talking beef short ribs simmered in an oily broth with potatoes, salt and scallions.  Tomas swears by this stuff, a traditional breakfast soup from the Andean region.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Good table.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  OK.  Gracias.  RUEDA:  Would you like chile?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do.  Yes.  Now we\\'re talking.\\n\\nRUEDA:  This is perfect.  When you have a good party last night.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was just going to say, this is hangover food.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I know hangover food well and this is good.  There\\'s good meat in there.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good broth.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The stock is good.  So what is this dish called?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Beef stock.  Caldo de Costilla.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Broth -- rib broth.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes, it\\'s rib.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Rib broth.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.  With potatoes, of course.  Everything with potatoes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Caldo de Costilla con tatos.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Costilla con tatos.  Very good Spanish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t speak Spanish.  I speak a little Mexican.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Bogota.  Back in the \\'90s, a very dangerous and violent place to be.  Today, not so much.  Today in my repeated experiences here, kind of awesome.  La Candelaria is the recently renovated old city where I meet up with Hector Abad.  Distinguished author and one of the most important and supremely talented writers in Latin America.\\n\\nHector\\'s recent work, a memoir called \"Oblivion\" is about his father who was killed for his outspoken attempts to change things for the better.\\n\\n(On camera):  So, first of all, where are we?\\n\\nHECTOR ABAD, AUTHOR:  Puerta Falsa.  This is a place where many Bogotans come to eat something in the middle of the morning or in the middle of the afternoon.  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  The tamales here are made with chicken and\\n\\npork belly combined with vegetables, rice and masa, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow cooked for hours.  This place has been serving chocolate completo to the politicians of nearby Plaza Bolivar for a couple of hundred years.\\n\\nABAD:  Here are the tamales.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s beautiful.  It is a thing of beauty, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nABAD:  Let\\'s see if it tastes like my mother\\'s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a high standard.\\n\\nABAD:  I suppose it is now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was just in Miraflores yesterday.\\n\\nABAD:  Yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What economy there was was entirely drug-based economy.  I mean, now that the drugs are gone, there is no economy.  It\\'s a ghost town.  It\\'s a military and people sitting there staring at the space waiting for the beer to arrive.  Best I can understand.\\n\\nTell me something hopeful.\\n\\nABAD:  I think we are becoming more and more conscious that this past decades of violence have been absolutely useless, and that we have to change many, many, many things .  So -- I think -- it\\'s not as good as my mother\\'s.  I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, it never is.  If you removed cocaine from the equation, if you removed the drug trade as a financial engine, you would still have serious divisions over ideology here.  Is that improving?\\n\\nABAD:  Things are changing in a good direction, but very slowly, I think.  You know, 10 years ago in Medellin they killed 7,500 people every year.  And three years ago this number came to 700 people killed in Medellin in the year.  So the situation has changed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nABAD:  I have only questions, I have no answers.  I\\'m so sorry.  If I were the president, I really I -- I don\\'t know what --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You would know what to do?\\n\\nABAD:  No, I wouldn\\'t.  I wouldn\\'t.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To suggest that a nation should expand its social services, do its best to lift people out of poverty, to provide medical care for everyone, as you well know, that may be in the minds of many as the same as (INAUDIBLE).  Are those as dangerous and potentially deadly ideas as they used to be?\\n\\nABAD:  Well, 25 years ago my father was killed just because he was asking for these basic things like clean water, a glass of milk, and an arepa for every child.  That was -- we still don\\'t have that and we need that.  Now we in Colombia, maybe we are trying.  I think there are some people here even in the government who are working for that.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Bogota is the largest city in Colombia and the economic heart of the country.  About a fifth of the population lives here.  Many of them very well, but some not so well.\\n\\nIt\\'s a city with a marked north/south divide.  Chef Tomas Rueda\\'s Tabula and Donostia restaurants sit side by side in the Macarena neighborhood where the city center meets the north.\\n\\nThe lunch Tomas is serving us here at Tabula is defined more by high quality fundamentals, than by high concept theories.  If there\\'s a theme here, it\\'s the ingredient this good, meticulously prepared, are the essence of great eating.\\n\\n(On camera):  It\\'s a beautiful space.  So how\\'s the restaurant business in Bogota?\\n\\nRUEDA:  It\\'s a very good business.  A lot of people with money, they don\\'t know how to cook.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nobody cooks at home.  Maybe their cook does.  So they eat out a lot?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.  It\\'s a new part of our culture.  Everybody wants to go to restaurants.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So 10 years ago, 15 years ago, what?  Traditional casual food?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few fine dining, you know, white tablecloths, serve, what, French or continental or Italian?  But this is new.\\n\\nRUEDA:  It\\'s a new stuff, it\\'s a new business, it\\'s a new world. There\\'s two great bodies from Colombia food, the mixture of the culture, yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Black people, Indian people, white people.  That mixture is beautiful.  And the other one is all of this region of the mountains, all the valleys, all the rivers, all the sea, we are like a big farm, a beautiful farm to send all these products to the world.  I believe more in a beautiful carrot than a great recipe, yes?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRUEDA:  This one is crop salad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nRUEDA:  And this one is our homemade pasta.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Thin sheets of handmade pasta are filled with Labneh cheese and finished with a chorizo sauce.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  So you used to be in a band?  You used to be a musician?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right?\\n\\nRUEDA:  I\\'m still.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what happened?  How did you go from music to restaurants?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Rock and roll don\\'t give me money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.\\n\\nRUEDA:  This is good.  Yes.  It\\'s really good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s great that business is good because generally speaking, the only worse idea that I think I\\'ll try to make a living making music is I think I\\'ll make a living by opening a restaurant.\\n\\nLet\\'s see why that\\'s so popular?  Good stuff.\\n\\nRUEDA:  Thank you, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tomas\\' take on Osso Bucco uses beef shank instead of veal which is braised over cubed vegetables, wine and broth in a wood-fired oven.\\n\\n(On camera):  Whoa, it\\'s -- it\\'s huge.  Yes.  (INAUDIBLE).  Yes.\\n\\nRUEDA:  You don\\'t need a knife.  Only with a spoon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re right.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nRUEDA:  Sorry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you cure this first in salt or --\\n\\nRUEDA:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dry it?  Salt it?\\n\\nRUEDA:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just fresh -- you know, the --\\n\\nRUEDA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Delicious.  So you\\'d never get this off your menu.  You\\'ll have to keep this on your menu forever, right?\\n\\nRUEDA:  Forever.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  This is --\\n\\nRUEDA:  The best part.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mama didn\\'t raise no fool.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Santiago De Cali or just Cali, as everybody calls it in these parts, is a city in the southwest of Colombia known for its proximity to the Pacific Coast and its semitropical temperatures, but I\\'m not really here for the climate.  I\\'m here for tejo.  It involves alcohol and explosives.\\n\\nColombian Mario Gallino, ex-pat, Will Holland, and their band mates are to be my guide to this ancient and traditional Colombian sport.\\n\\n(On camera):  How do you play this game?  I guess that\\'s how it\\'s done.  What do you call this object?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  El tejo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  El tejo.  Hence the name of the --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.  Tejo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I should be good at this.  I\\'ve been throwing pots into the dish sink from across the room for years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You win more points if you get in the middle without hitting anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But that doesn\\'t sound like any fun.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everyone has a different style, it seems.  So you\\'ve got to do like one and then another, and swing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t think that style is going to work for me.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  After some more or less success it turns out we all pretty much suck at this.\\n\\n(On camera):  Not enough beer.  That\\'s my problem.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Time to bring in some outside muscle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re going to mix in now the experts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who am I with?  I\\'m over here with these guys.  Whoa.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nHoly crap, two in a row?  This is (INAUDIBLE).  No, wait.  One of those guys had to be on my team, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So the guy in the white striped shirt.  His name is El Pollo Viejo, which is --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The old chicken.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The old chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I need a poultry name.  He\\'s calling himself the old chicken.  I should be the enormous cock.  The chicken dude is killing it.  Yes, he\\'s -- every time.  That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.  But I wanted something to blow up.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Tejo is hungry work.  But the kitchen here is up to the challenge, making a Colombian picata.  This is a huge selection of fried pork, pork rib, steak, casava, potatoes, and deep-fried plantain.\\n\\n(On camera):  I smelt food.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, that\\'s good.  A beer, explosives and food?  Can\\'t beat that.  Yes.  Yes.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If Bogota is Colombia\\'s financial heart, then Cali is its shaking hips.  People here like their music.  My tejo buddies Mario and Will are the founders of a collective called On the Tropica.  Their idea was to reinterpret the tropical music heritage of Colombia.  What often sounds like salsa in style is actually Cumbia. If there\\'s one type of music that can be classified as distinctly Colombian, this is it.\\n\\nCumbia draws on the music of the African indigenous and European mix that makes up the country.  So Will and Mario created something a long way from the pop music that\\'s a staple here.  They brought together musicians who had been famous on the Cumbia seen in the \\'50s and \\'60s, and matched them up with younger counterparts.\\n\\nAs if the impressive amount of fried meat we ate at the tejo courts wasn\\'t enough, we go for dinner at one of the band\\'s favorite spots.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The recording that we made for three weeks in Medellin, had 42 musicians so it\\'s a big sort of ensemble.  And there were musicians from, what, I think the youngest was 25, maybe, and the oldest was maybe 82.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Old school and new school mix?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, that was the idea so we can meet -- not only doing music, but like also exchanging lots of like information about how music was made, how music was recorded.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What was the spirit of the music.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So that\\'s the ideas, is to get back to the roots.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  First up, the Cali version of ceviche.  Cooked shrimp lathered in mayonnaise, ketchup and Worstershire sauce. Essentially a \\'70s shrimp cocktail.  Native to the mangroves in the Pacific Coast, the (INAUDIBLE) is a staple used in everything from tamales to stews.\\n\\n(On camera):  Cooked rice, and like Guancha, not a clam --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The mollusk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s not a clam.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s like a rock mollusk pretty much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s delicious.  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So this is like Palau, very Pacific, this is pago rojo, like red snapper.  Steamed shrimp.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And some nice green tomatoes.  They always find (INAUDIBLE) everywhere.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (INAUDIBLE) is --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Plantain.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With all of this food you have to accompany with some beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I\\'m learning that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s the best way to just handle this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  From cane sugar.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, cane sugar like homemade --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So I\\'m just going to take one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what are your favorite places in Colombia?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Colombia is like five countries in one.  When you come to Colombia you definitely have to go some Pacifico experience, either with Cali or go straight for the coast.  You have to have like an Atlantic or Caribbean experience.  You definitely have to have like a mountain experience, like Medellin or Bogota.  Another would be like just go to the Amazon, you know, like just go the jungle and --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m planning a vacation.  Should I come to Colombia? Should I come to Cali?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Most definitely, man.  Like, you will find great music, great partying, great food, beautiful views, beautiful nature around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, yes, look, the country is beautiful, we know this. OK.  But most Americans, they\\'re afraid to come.  Is Colombia any more dangerous for a tourist than Rio or Puerto Rico?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  South America (ph)?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, my impression is no.  You know, when you go to Rio, you don\\'t wear a big watch, you don\\'t wear an expensive suit, you don\\'t -- you don\\'t behave like an idiot, and life is going to be good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like maybe I\\'ve been lucky, but I\\'ve never been, you know, mugged or kidnapped or robbed.  Most people will tell you that we had an amazing time.  We heard some great music, we met some beautiful girls or guys.  We drank some great drinks, and we just hung out, and we went to the beach, and we -- it was a great and we want to come back, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, there\\'s a lot of hearty here.  People feel very, very deeply.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  About things.  It is the most welcoming country in Latin America that I\\'ve been.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Salud, salud, salud.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I leave the subtropics for more extreme climbs.  Riohacha is a city 600 miles northeast of Cali on Colombia\\'s Caribbean Sea.  The Guajira is the most northern part of South America and borders Venezuela in the east.\\n\\nIt\\'s home to the native semi Nomadic people of Colombia called the Wayuu.  The Wayuus are a tough autonomous tribe who\\'s never taken sides with either the government, the FARC or the paramilitaries.  As a result, they remain independent politically and live pretty much by their own code.\\n\\nI\\'m meeting Juan Pablo Majorca, a chef from Bogota who comes to this spot on a regular basis.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is not another country.  This is Colombia.  But it\\'s a very different part of Colombia.\\n\\nJUAN PABLO MAJORCA, CHEF:  The Guajiras are very rugged terrain. There\\'s desert.  There\\'s not that much water, so that\\'s part of why the Spaniards, they weren\\'t able to colonize it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve been coming more for some time.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  I became interested in Guajira because I began dealing with fresh fish and fresh lobster, fresh shrimp, and for goat meat to take back to Bogota.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it good?\\n\\nMAJORCA:  It\\'s very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Goats are important to the Wayuu, as they\\'re used for food, for bartering, and even as dowry payments.  Rancho owners come to the old market in Riohacha to sell, slaughter and cook goat in the mornings.  Today we\\'re having very frichi.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  This is a traditional fish from the Wayuu.  It consists of the trifes, the heart, the intestines, and the offal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Of the goat.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  So it\\'s really fresh because they slaughter them back here and this is where the Wayuu women cook it so it\\'s really fresh and traditional.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this is breakfast.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  This is breakfast for them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A little bit of everything in there?\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Yes.  We have hearts.  We have a little bit of meat, of ribs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now --\\n\\nMAJORCA:  And it\\'s interesting because this one, it\\'s for breakfast, and it\\'s almost done with the slaughter.  They have to eat this fresh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fresh this is delicious.  Not fresh this would not be so good.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  No.  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is where I say something to take us\\n\\nseamlessly from a discussion about fresh meat to me hauling my aging carcass on an ATV sugar bear style.  Tribal members of the Wayuu have dual citizenship and can cross the border into Venezuela to live or trade there whenever they need to.\\n\\nLuckily for us it means that cheap gas is easy to come by in these parts.  There are no stations as such.  You just keep an eye out for the cans.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Most of this gas is from Venezuela.  It\\'s extremely cheap. It\\'s like 50 cents a gallon.  The government subsidizes a lot of it. They are able to buy Venezuelan gasoline and sell legally Venezuelan gasoline in Colombia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Having taken on as much gas as can be mouth siphoned in one sitting, we\\'re off again.  Let me set the scene.  It\\'s hot out here. Desert hot.  And we plan to ride three hours along the coast to our lunch spot, and I ate salty goat innards for breakfast and I refuse to wear a helmet or sun block.  We avoid wild donkeys and goats and get lost more than a few times.  So a little heat stroke leads to a lot of horsing around, and we decide to open these puppies up.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  A momentary concussion is seldom a good thing. Waking up in Colombia on a beach almost always is.  Having abandoned the epic ride, we\\'re back where we started in (INAUDIBLE), in the Guajira at the Blue Sea Restaurant.\\n\\n(On camera):  How come you\\'re all clean?\\n\\nMAJORCA:  I changed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You brought a change of clothes?\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m hurting now.  I\\'m feeling every minute, every hour, every month and year of my age.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  So you\\'re ready for some cazuela?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  I trust it will make me feel all better.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Much better.  It\\'s a good end to a --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Can\\'t ask for better scenery.  It\\'s beautiful here.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  A beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I need the anesthetic qualities of the local fire water.\\n\\n(On camera):  That\\'s probably a really good idea.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  That\\'s going to be a good start for tonight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A good start.  I\\'m done.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Oh, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That dog has the right idea.  See, I\\'d be very happy if that was me right now.  Just like laying down in the sand with my chin out like that.  Man, it\\'s so beautiful here.  Who comes here?\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Basically tourists from Colombia and a lot of backpackers that are making their way up to the north in Guajira.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  But I mean, we saw one tourist all day.  Yes, it\\'s nice, really it\\'s completely off the grid.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  This used to be a fisherman village.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There are definitely worst places to eat seafood than beachside in a fishing village and the strength of this stew, cazuela de mariscos, lies in the variety of fish available.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Basically like a fish chowder.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Made with shrimp, clams.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  (INAUDIBLE), which is a small kind of clam, a lobster, fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  And conch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I need a bath.  Very clear sky for the Caribbean.  Oh, yes. Oh, man.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  Always accompanied by lemon and coconut rice and plantain, and some hot sauce in there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Some good food, a few shots of (INAUDIBLE), the sounds of waves in the background, a nice sunset.  These are things in my experience that will set most things right.\\n\\n(On camera):  Thank you to Guajira.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  To Guajira.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And Colombia.\\n\\nMAJORCA:  To Guajira and Colombia.  Salud.  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We had good fun.  MAJORCA:  We had good fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  I always find Colombia encouraging.  They face problems more extreme and seemingly more intractable than many of us can imagine, and yet every time I come here it gets better.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong.  Problems, serious problems, remain, which is particularly heartbreaking in a country so beautiful, so generous, so proud, so eager to love and be loved back.\\n\\nI come back to my own country from Colombia and I think if they can fix that, if they can make things better, then surely there\\'s nothing we can\\'t do.\\n\\nFor now, however, I\\'ll settle for fixing my headache.  That hurt.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  How does the joke begin? Three men in a bar, but it\\'s not a bar.  Imagine the Bronx.  A corner bodega, or maybe a luncheonette, a diner.  Three men, strictly by coincidence, find themselves in the same place at the same time. Sitting at the counter is Afrika Bambaataa.  Across the room is Melle Mel.  Door opens and who walks in?  D.J. Kool Herc.  Three men who created the musical style that\\'s become the soundtrack to, well, the whole wide world.\\n\\nDo they nod at each other, lament how all of them got screwed over, cut out of the big money, or just laugh of a the absurdity of it all? Hip hop came from nowhere else.  It could have come from nowhere else, but the Bronx.\\n\\nThis is the Bronx.  You\\'ve probably heard about it.  You may even have a pretty solid image in your head of what it looks like.  What it is like.  Or maybe you can\\'t picture it at all.  The South Bronx sounds familiar as a bad thing.  And the Bronx at one time was said to be burning, wasn\\'t it?  For the most part, the Bronx is overlooked, the never visited borough in New York City, which is a shame, because the Bronx is a magical place with its own energy, its own food, vibe, and rhythm.  You\\'ve been to Brooklyn.  Maybe it\\'s time you took a look at the Bronx.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In August of 1973, the sister of D.J. Kool Herc was holding a birthday party for herself in the basement of 1520 Central Avenue.  As Kool Herc was playing the music on his two-disk turntable, he began to slow the music down, slow the record.  People stood up and took notice, and they began asking him to do it again. He did it again.  They asked him to do it again and again.  He did it again, and he attracted more and more people to his performances, and people began to imitate him.  And that was the beginning of hip-hop music.  It started in the Bronx.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Moody\\'s Records, inside rummaging for records just like he used to do is the man, the legend, one of the very select few who started it all.  Who created the sound that hundreds of millions of people now claim as their own.  Google, \"Who created hip hop?\"  Go ahead.  You get, D.J. Kool Herc.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s a national landmark now, is it?\\n\\nD.J. KOOL HERC, FOUNDER OF HIP-HOP:  No, it\\'s not, we\\'re working on it.  Working on it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Working on it. HERC:  It\\'s still the birthplace of hip-hop, undisputed because I didn\\'t start it with four guys in a club.  I was inside a residential building.  At the time, it wasn\\'t really received in the building.  We had a watchful eye over the recreation room.  So she would watch for any disturbance.  It never happened.  And that\\'s how it survived because good music set itself, good drug set itself, good anything set itself, and this was something good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Was there a moment when you realized, well, this is big, this is going to be -- this is going to spread way beyond my neighborhood?\\n\\nHERC:  Never looked at it as that.  I saw it spreading, but it reminded me of Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone.  Dressed up like Jam Master Jay, you know?  The DMC fellows.  But I\\'d see that to sell commercial, and I know it was going.  It was going.  It doesn\\'t take a big lift.\\n\\nSo let\\'s say I don\\'t have money and all that.  Now, I\\'m rich in other ways.  But \"TIME\" magazine said when music was created inside the United States.  You got Louis Armstrong for jazz.  You got Elvis Presley for rock and roll.  Of course, that could be between him and Chuck Berry.  And you got Kool Herc for hip-hop.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Feel good?\\n\\nHERC:  Very good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Historically, from the last third of the 19th Century into about 1920, the second language spoken in the Bronx was German.  From about 1930 to about 1960, the second language spoken in the Bronx was Yiddish.  From about 1965 onward, the second language spoken in the Bronx is Spanish, and that\\'s the way it is today.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s got a reputation as a tough place: crime, street gangs, a lot of which goes back to the way it was and some of which, well, like I said, it\\'s got a reputation as being tough.\\n\\nThe Bronx is, let\\'s face it, a big blank space in a lot of people\\'s minds.  Even people like me who live, what, ten minutes away, we don\\'t know anything about that big area between Yankees Stadium and the Bronx Zoo.\\n\\nWhat you should know is that the Bronx is big.  Really big.  And that it\\'s a patchwork of ethnic enclaves, a cross-section of the whole world.  Every immigrant group you could think of.\\n\\nJustin Fornal, a.k.a., Baron Ambrosia, has taken it upon himself to serve as the Bronx\\'s culinary ambassador.\\n\\nJUSTIN FORNAL, \"BARON AMBROSIA\":  Let the dinner begin.  This is the porcupine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An evangelist for the cause of introducing the manifold splendiferous delights of this mighty borough to the ignorant, well, like me.  He\\'s got a show on the TV, and he throws parties where he serves creatures that would make Andrew Zimmer turn gray and slump unconscious to the floor.  Showman, iconoclast, explorer, and gourmet.\\n\\nFORNAL:  The Bronx, it\\'s so multifaceted, but for some reason this is the first place I always take people.  This just oozes and emanates kind of that flavor of the Bronx.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And he knows what I like.  Places like this, 188 Cuchifritos on 188th Street and the Grand Concourse.  Old-school New York Puerto Rican good stuff.  Get within 20 feet of this place and prepare to lose your freaking mind.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Cuchifrito itself is basically fried pig.  The ears, the tongue, chopped up and deep fried.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So off-cut pig parts, deep fried.  What\\'s not to like about that?  Is that the shank there.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Yes, the shoulder.  We\\'re going to get that in there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Big piece of the skin, just chopped up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So skin.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Skin, fat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Skin and fat?\\n\\nFORNAL:  Yes.  It\\'s almost like a little meat candy bar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s amazing.  Amazing.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Some morcilla.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Morcilla, for sure.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Always morcilla.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And then what else?  We need some placano (ph).\\n\\nFORNAL: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Puerto Rico, I missed you.\\n\\nFORNAL:  The Bronx to me became a place where I could really engage my bacchanalian sensibility.  You could really just come here, eat, drink, wine, women song, and just indulge.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is pretty much the center of the pork universe as I\\'ve ever seen it in New York.  I don\\'t any place porkier than what I\\'m looking at.\\n\\n(voice-over):  This is exactly the kind of thing I thought we\\'d lost in New York, that one after the other faded away in the neighborhood\\'s I lived in.  And all along, all along it was there, right underfoot, a gusher of porky goodness.  FORNAL:  There\\'s a great line, which is they say, in France, which is\\n\\nc\\'est la Bronx.  Which is, \"What do you think, this is the Bronx?\" And you know, this idea of the music\\'s really loud or someone\\'s making a mess.  To me I take that as a point of pride.  To be the Bronx, is where the music is loud.  The Bronx is where the men are tough, the women are sexy, the food is spicy.  If those things weren\\'t true, you wouldn\\'t know what the Bronx is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So its bad reputation is what protects it?\\n\\nFORNAL:  I think the perception, the perception of it being a place where the funk is alive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Incredible, incredible spread.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Yes, man, this is great.  This is one of the places you\\'ll just kind of dream about: was I really there?  I\\'m going back to see if that place is really there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I can\\'t lay off this pork.  It\\'s insane.  I\\'m actually going to get a to-go order.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yo, love for my haters, forgiveness for my enemies, move spectators.  AS I\\'m dead if they shot Kennedy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m from the Bronx, New York, and I don\\'t beg your pardon, I was 12 or 13 when hip hop was started.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just go and take a minute to listen to what those fools speak, it\\'s clear uncut garbage.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just let me bump, fill my energy up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No logic, a bunch of false prophets pushing a poisonous product.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I\\'m not hard to find.  I\\'m right by the zoo, by the gorilla cage.  Holler at me, baby.  Ooo, ooo!\\n\\nWatch it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First to call himself an emcee, another pioneer, Melle Mel. In 1982, and he Grandmaster Flash wrote and recorded \"The Message,\" an album that was a complete and ground-breaking departure from the kind of lyrics and content up to that point.\\n\\nMELLE MEL, PIONEER IN HIP-HOP:  Before we started doing hip-hop music, there was no hip-hop music, so we played everything.  We played disco. We played reggae.  We played rock.  We watched \"Hee Haw.\"  That was like the favorite in our house.  That was one of our favorite shows, \"Hee Haw,\" you know.  And all of those things kind of became the components of what became hip-hop music.\\n\\nI started out as a break dancer.  So I used to break dance.  You know, my brother used to, you know, do graffiti, and all of those individual elements wasn\\'t really happening anywhere else.  So it was just something that could only have went on right in that area in the Bronx.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, OK, you may be thinking, what about the Sugar Hill Gang, what about them?  They were an industry band like The Monkees or The Archies, built to cash in quick from what was seen as a fad.  And they did cash in.\\n\\n(on camera):  Where were you when you suddenly realized, shit, there\\'s money in this?\\n\\nMEL:  Well, that first record I ever heard was \"King Tim III.\"  The second and the most popular record was \"Rappers Delight.\"  I used to live on the fifth floor walk-up.  I walked out, somebody was playing it next door, was playing it on the fourth floor, was playing it on the third floor, second floor.  First floor.  Somebody had a boom box outside playing it.  The car that drove by had it on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nMEL:  Nothing that was like a plague.  It was like -- it was like locusts.  And that\\'s when I realized, you know, it was -- it\\'s something that was beyond what we was doing out in the street. Critically, it\\'s not a great record, but if you play it right now, it\\'s still, you know, it\\'s still a good record.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In this case at least, history has come around.  Today, nobody looks back at the Sugar Hill Gang as having been originals or innovators.  People know who did what.\\n\\nMEL:  As far as hip hop-now, as far as the music now, these guys are not trying to tell the story of their time at all.  OK, yes they popped a lot of bottles.  Oh, yes, they had sex with a lot of women and they drove a lot of expensive cars and nothing else happened.\\n\\nBut you would never know that there was a black president, you would never know that there was two wars.  You would never know those things, because it\\'s not reflected in the music.  And at some point, somebody was supposed to step up and make those songs.  Twenty years from now, they\\'ll still be talking about \"The Message\" and \"Planet Rock\" and all the classic records.  You know what I mean?  That\\'s what it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN;  Robert Moses has been dead over 30 years now.  And people in the Bronx, for the most part, still hate him.  His role as master builder, he ran the cross-Bronx Expressway and the parkway system straight through dozens of working-class neighborhoods, seemingly uncaring about the destruction of whole communities.\\n\\nMassive housing projects conceived as utopian solutions to stacking the poor or the centralized vertical ghettoes were also his bright idea.\\n\\nHe did leave some pretty impressive damn works behind, though, like the Tri-borough Bridge, Flushing Meadows Park, the Verrazano Bridge.  The Bronx happens to be the home of the two largest parks in New York\\n\\nCity, Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt, and you see stuff here you probably ain\\'t seen in Central Park.\\n\\nThe Garifuna come from Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize, and they trace they ethnic group back to a single slave ship that crashed off St. Vincent and whose freed Africans then mixed with Carib Indians.  Where is home for many of the Garifuna community living in the U.S.?  You guessed it, the Bronx.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Living in the Bronx, you\\'re able to kind of travel the world without leaving the borough.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nFORNAL:  And, you know, it\\'s like an addiction.  When you go to another country and the first day in the market, and all your dreams and you smell the diesel, and you\\'re just looking around, like where\\'s that one thing I\\'m looking for?  To be able to do that, really, in your own backyard, it\\'s...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have mohutu (ph).  That\\'s coconut soup with fish.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Uh-huh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Over here, we have a tapo (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  ... with banana, yucca, yotia (ph), malanga and coconut soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That sounds good.  Yes, there\\'s some neck bones and it. Yes, let\\'s do it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So let\\'s put some plantain here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In Garifuna cuisine, mashed plantains come with just about every dish.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Plantains are just part of me.  That\\'s part of hotutu (ph). You\\'ll never have this without it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like fofu (ph).\\n\\nFORNAL:  Yes.  Same method, same right hand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Same principals.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Same everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s fish and coconut soup.\\n\\n(on camera):  What kind of fish is this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Blue fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Blue fish.  Awesome, I love blue fish.\\n\\n(voice-over):  And some nice smoked neck bones with bananas and yucca.\\n\\n(on camera):  That\\'s officially awesome already.  Oh, that\\'s tasty. It\\'s really good.  An underexploited fish, one of my favorites.\\n\\nSo you know what I\\'ve noticed already?  The Bronx is big.  How ludicrous and shameful is it that I can literally see my house from here and I basically have no idea where I am?\\n\\nFORNAL:  No fault on your own, but I think that\\'s kind of what keeps the Bronx so amazing, is that you have all these in-touch ethnic enclaves.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I didn\\'t know there were Hondurans here, much less 200,000 Garifuna.  No clue.\\n\\nFORNAL:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve been saying the neck is the next big thing for years now.  Still waiting.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People from all over the world reside in the Bronx.  As a matter of fact, we have residents from every continent on the face of the earth, and if you count the penguins in the Bronx Zoo, that includes Antarctica.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The wellspring of hip-hop is right around here, a mostly Jamaican community in Bronx River in the South Bronx. Jamaicans began arriving here back in the \\'50s, and still today, Jamaican food, Jamaican culture, the music, is all over.  Sundial International headquarters, makers of traditional tonics and herbal remedies, a Bronx institution since the \\'70s.\\n\\nBABA RASHAN ABDUL HAKIM, SUNDIAL INTERNATIONAL:  This is enough ingredients.  This is the mahogany bark.  This one is used for any type of bodily weaknesses.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Baba Rashan Abdul Hakim, or Pops Baba (ph) as he\\'s called, a grassroots bush doctor, healer.  He uses recipes passed down from mothers and aunties, blends of roots, spices, herbs, barks, and woods.\\n\\nHAKIM:  wood root in the morning and at night, it\\'ll cure what\\'s wrong with you.  You\\'re going to have improvement.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whatever ails, he\\'s got a cure.  Wood root, cure for the blood, the body, the nerves.  Portamanti (ph), an intestinal cleanser, and traditional African manback (ph), helps you get your manhood back, among other things.  HAKIM:  It was about 1956 that I came to America.  So I could make it\\n\\nin the apartment in the Bronx River.  And the whole project smell up this roof, they used to jive then.  Hey, what are you doing in there? What kind of hocus pocus in there doing.  You know what I mean?  And I\\'d box it and go in the car, and I\\'d sell it in the Bronx.  The Bronx is the best place in America.  Nowhere like the Bronx.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In the yard out back, some freshly roasted Jamaican coffee, and this man.  A Tyrannosaurus Rex of music.  A man who changed the world for generations, Afrika Bambaataa.  Bambaataa and Pops go back together to the same housing projects.\\n\\nAFRIKA BAMBAATAA, MUSICIAN:  You know James Baba Papa don\\'t play no rest?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nBAMBAATAA:  That\\'s the Baba.  Brother Rashad.  That\\'s right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): He and his associates in the Zulu nation were absolutely instrumental in shaping what became hip-hop culture: break dancing, graffiti, DJing and rap.\\n\\n(on camera):  Is this true that you\\'d soak your records in water, you\\'d take the label off?\\n\\nBAMBAATAA;  Yes, we\\'d put tapes on it or we\\'d soak the label off.  You know, you\\'d have spies in these other camps, trying to find out what was that beat Bambaataa playing?  So I used to soak it off.  I used to put on tape to cover the records, and we was digging in the crates hard.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were unusually voracious in your musical tastes.  Of all the records in the world, how did you come upon Kraftwerk?\\n\\nBAMBAATAA:  I came about it digging in the crate down in the Village. I said this looks type of weird.  When I took it home and I heard the sound, I said, \"Whoa.\"  I said, \"This is some funky, hmm.\"  I said, \"Man, this is some futuristic type of funk here,\" whether they didn\\'t know they were doing some style of funk, and thus came the birth of the electric funk sound, Miami based sound.  And since the beginning, we always paid tribute to James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone and George \"Parliament Funkadelic\" Clinton for bringing the funk from which the hip hop came and the reggae and to, you know, all the pioneers of hip hop.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Up north a ways in West Jamaica, another working class community where subway service is pretty limited and yet people to have to get up, go to work, and often make the long hump to another borough.\\n\\nAfterwards, a person could use a drink.  And if you\\'re a Jamaican person, you could use the everyday, go-to drink of back home, any time of day and night, Ray and Nephew.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ray and Nephew was a very strong Jamaican white rum that we use for everything from baby fever...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ... to drinks here in this bar.  You get it with cranberry juice, with milk, or water.  What water would be in any other borough is what Ray and Nephew is in the Bronx.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jesus is one half of the brilliant podcast team Jesus versus Kid Marrow (ph).  It\\'s a very fast, freeform riff diatribe on life in the Bronx and what\\'s happening on the news, in hip-hop, or last night.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE;  Growing up in the Bronx you\\'re isolated from the rest of the city.  You know what I\\'m saying?  So the other city has like City Bite.  The Bronx doesn\\'t get any of that.  We\\'re kind of abandoned up here.  People get on a boat and go to Staten Island before they ride up to the Bronx.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve got to reluctantly -- have to be in part of the problem.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They always say the Bronx is eventually going to be gentrified.  That\\'s not happening any time soon.  It\\'s not.\\n\\nThere\\'s the owner right here.  This is the man right here who made today possible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\n(voice-over):  I am happy here.  And I will drink more of your Ray and Nephew, regardless of what it might be doing to my brain, but then, I will eat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is this?  Pork foot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Pigtail.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Awesome.\\n\\nOh hell, I love this.  Oh.  Man, that looks good.  People sort of stopped paying attention to the Bronx when it wasn\\'t burning anymore. When Fort Apache was something we didn\\'t have to think about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Do you remember your first time?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I remember my first time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do you feel, first time, stopped the first time?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I cried.  And that summer, 15 times, stop and frisk, just thrown up against the gate, fingers to our genitals, and cops looking for guns.  But you remember that, you remember your first time.  When you lose your stop and frisk virginity.  You know, you remember it. BOURDAIN:  I\\'ve never been stopped and frisked.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I wonder why?  What is - Is it because you have a CNN show or is it just because ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve been arrested.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you hang around here long enough, I can get you stop and frisked.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  They talk about DIY culture, about do it yourself.  And you better be able to do it your damn self in the Bronx because often, nobody else is going to do it for you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When you go in the Bronx, you\\'re basically going back in time.  There are certain crimes that will happen here that are not going to happen in Manhattan and Brooklyn.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  OK, it\\'s an ...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Purse snatchers.  BOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s still - there is a little bit crackheads in front of that building over there.\\n\\nAnd they are getting their cracks, and they not bothering anyone.  And you know the thing is, they are respecting parts of this community. You see them every day.  There\\'s literally a crackhead that\\'s been here for 25 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That takes some determination now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Listen, if I could be a crackhead, I would be the best crackhead possible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was a crackhead, and oh ...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Listen, people have been there.  No judgments.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How are you doing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, what\\'s up?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  Look, I\\'m thinking curry goat. BOURDAIN (voice over):  Pheses\\'s (ph) Uncle Vernon used to own this place, but that was three owners ago.  Now it\\'s Lammy\\'s, and the Lammy took over from some people who put too much cinnamon in their curry goat, which as we all know, is a sin against god.  Lammy fixed things. Curry goat and stewed ox tail with rice and peas, collards, and yes, mac and cheese.  I can\\'t resist.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, correct me if I\\'m wrong, listen, there\\'s a lot of good food in the Bronx.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is, there is.  If people would like you know get over their bias and come above 96th street, they would find out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean if the Bronx were a neighborhood in Manhattan, sort of shrunk down, you\\'d have hipsters crawling all over.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh my god.\\n\\nIf you live in the Bronx it\\'s not necessarily that you\\'re going to ever leave the Bronx for the Manhattan.  Because everything you want, everything you need is in the Bronx, so why would you go past 149th street?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So all that, wrapping my neighborhood, the ethnic pride and all that stuff, people would definitely hold on to that. And that\\'s definitely true of Rylander (ph) Avenue, that avenue to do - that stuff.\\n\\nEven this neighborhood was all white until the \\'50s.  It\\'s very recent the whole immigrant ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who lived here in the \\'50s?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All white people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What kind of white people?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  White white.  Like we enjoy milk white, that kind of, we\\'re kissing dogs on the mouth.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s moved forward, now you have this, and there\\'s definitely this whole, you know, like I\\'m from 233rd, you\\'re from 225th, every ethnic group, at least in the Bronx has that.  I think the next group that\\'s going to take over here is definitely Mexicans, and the thing is, it\\'s an immigrant neighborhood.  So, it\\'s not a matter of who owns it, it\\'s who owns it at what particular time and they\\'re next.  And I\\'m looking for it tonight, because I enjoy good quesadillas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But I made the good decision to come to Lammy\\'s today.  So ..\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.  That was good move.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lammy\\'s you speak of Lammy\\'s.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Speak of Lammy\\'s\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m here all the time.  I\\'m always here.  I live right there.  So, I\\'m always here for the curry goat, mac and cheese, you know.\\n\\nLammy\\'s don\\'t play, man.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The twos and the fives here are the greatest trains because they go from Bronx through Manhattan all the way through Brooklyn.  So, it\\'s the only number of lines that will get three boroughs, you know, visibility.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Bronx still here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, it\\'s still here.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But you know, like even that, I mean that brings me back, Tony, that sound.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you remember the first time you put spray paint on a wall?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When was that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Summer of \\'70.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Back then, seemingly overnight, they were everywhere, princes of the city, their pieces stretching across city blocks, whole trains, evermore audacious, some, like this man, were artists.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In the late \\'70s, to be on of a rooftop like this with a brew or whatever, hanging out, we\\'re waiting for something to come through with a cool letter or like oh my god, look at that T. And so inner kids are screaming, like, oh my god, look, oh my god, you know, here it comes.  Here it comes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  There\\'s my mine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s mine, there\\'s mine.  But what if you thought the train you painted here was on the left side.  Then you kind of messed up.  Oh no, it\\'s on the right side.  And no, you\\'re not screwed, you just wait until this train goes all the way to Brooklyn and comes all the way back.  BOURDAIN:  So, this was the audience that you had in mind?  Does\\n\\nmatter?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think all of us spoke to each other back then.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Other arts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, you know, I mean it was just the rush of the event, and then the accolades you may or may not receive.  Certainly not from the public, but from your peers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Futura 2000, his style and that of a few of his colleagues, spread across the globe.  I miss those trains. Others, not so much.  I get it, it went on and on until there seemed there wasn\\'t an untagged, unmarked, un-scrawled upon bit of wall or window in New York, but for a while, it was a golden time.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well the whole point of being here ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Was to me what the Bronx was about, not just the music and the scene and coming up with the parties, with the likes of Bam and Herc (ph) and, you know, everyone of that era, but it\\'s watching trains.  It\\'s what we used to call it benching.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You were watching each other\\'s work go by?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Art lovers.\\n\\n(voice over):  This was his museum.  Where he and his fellow artists would meet and exchange ideas and admire each other\\'s work.  And it\\'s jarring coming to learn all those years later that it was really all about this, how about a few seconds as their pieces rode by to be evaluated by peers.  There for a moment, then gone.  Like well all of their work from that time, long since removed or painted over.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ultimately, the legacy -- here, here\\'s our legacy. You know, we don\\'t have a movement anymore.  The movement has been given to the world.  And if you go to trains in Milan and, you know, Paris, or wherever, you know, certainly not the Russian system, but if you go to some of these cities around the world, they\\'re bombed.  You know, their rail systems are destroyed.\\n\\nBut I mean, today, if I could have a train running --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That would be nice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It would be epic.  And I think any artist, Picasso, any artist from any generation, if that concept was available, like here is some public art guys, let it run through our countryside.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK) BOURDAIN (voice over):  Take the six trains to the end of the line, then do the same for the number 29 bus.  Technically you\\'ll still be in the Bronx, but it kind of won\\'t feel like it.  City Island is a fishing village turned what?  A parking lot for pleasure boats, and a long established restaurant row for New Yorkers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You picked the perfect day to come out here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Desus (ph) says this place, and Desus is always right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  How far from the neighborhood by car?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  By car?  Maybe 15, 20 minutes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  20 minutes.\\n\\n(voice over):  That seems like a world away.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, but I want to buy some nautical brick-o- brack while I\\'m here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is New York City?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is - Cape Cod in the Bronx.  Many of my childhood memories, getting all this out, to come out and be get there and they\\'re like oh the beach is closed for the medical reason.  It\\'s not a day that you go in the water and just come out with like a maxi pad stuck to you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Been there.  So you were here like when, yesterday?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was literally here yesterday.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For my sister\\'s graduation because every time you have an event of note in the Bronx, you have to come celebrate at City Island.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I noticed all the big catering halls.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, you can get married, you get arraigned, the baby\\'s not yours, come here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Seashore restaurant, a massive fish factory on the water of a type I\\'m very familiar with, having started my cooking career in one just like it.\\n\\nI\\'m also a sentimental fool, and I love this kind of thing.  Steamers, a true taste of childhood.  Boiled striper and some snow crab and a nice cold beer, yes, thank you, Desus.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s like a knighting ceremony.  Just kind of sit up, and you\\'re just like oh, just take it all in.  Enjoy guys.  BOURDAIN (on camera):  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I could have done that myself, but ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s part of it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s part of the ambience.\\n\\nThis is the perfect place for a date, but it\\'s the worst food for a date.  Either a huge turnoff or a huge turn on.  Like you might give a lady a preview of what they\\'re about to get into.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All the little bib, little sucking action.  Just let them know, you know, in an hour, this could be you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Maybe I missed it all my life.  This is pretty awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Saturday night, City Island, that\\'s where people are going.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The first European settler to come to the Bronx came in 1639.  His name was Jonas Bronck.  B, R, O, N, C, K.  In 1874, all the area west of the Bronx River was annexed to the city and in 1895, all the area east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city, and in 1898, the city then decided that the two areas previously annexed should also become a borough.  But what to call it since it never had a name before?  They looked at the map and right smack to the middle of the territory ran the Bronx River, so they named it after the river, the borough of the Bronx, and that is why it is called the Bronx and not just plain Bronx.\\n\\nIf you have a question about the Bronx, chances are Lloyd Alton has the answer.  Born and raised here, he\\'s never really left for over seven decades.  This is a disappearing aspect of New York for sure. The real thing Jewish deli, Liebman\\'s is one of the last.  There used to be dozens of places where you can get your brisket, chopped liver, ragu patstramis (ph) or pickles, and the black cherry soda or a souree (ph) of course, to drink.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The World Series is going on, Howard Kosel (ph) is on the air.  Suddenly you see a tongue of flame licking up into the sky.  And he says, this is the kind of thing that Jimmy taught us all, ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning.\\n\\nThe old image of the Bronx as middle class, mobile, healthy area had survived up until 1977, this shattered it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right. (voice over):  The Bronx was burning, went the story, and that stuck. Politicians making the south Bronx a poster child for what was hopelessly wrong, would always be wrong, would never, we were told, get any better.\\n\\n(on camera):  So we now have what you call a slum lord essentially. Snapping up large numbers of buildings.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, first of all, he takes out a huge fire insurance policy.  So as he goes to these junkies and he says listen, you see that empty apartment on the top floor?  I\\'m going to turn my back.  You take all of the lead pipes that are in there, but I have one request, please, before you leave, turn on the water, and the water comes down, driving everybody else out.  They then hire an arsonist and sets fire to the building, they collect all the money, and they leave.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I remember it well.  I remember those few years.  Things were bad.  Are things borough-wide, are things getting better?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is the Bronx better?  Absolutely.  There is more home ownership in the south Bronx than had ever existed in history. That doesn\\'t mean that we\\'ve reached utopia.  We have not.  How long it will take, I\\'m a historian.  I look in the other direction.  I would say my crystal ball is cracked.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I got four cheeseburgers for the front.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Is it the best hamburger in the world?  Far from it, my friends.  Is it even strictly speaking, a burger?  I mean, it\\'s small and square and steamed.  It can be, especially when you eat a lot of them, as one tends to, a hate yourself in the morning experience.  But if you grew up with White Castle like I did and like handsome Dick Manitoba did, this connects with some deep dinosaur part of the brain, evoking a powerful emotional response.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These are a great cultural part of my childhood. We\\'d come here 24 hours a day.  There were guys on their dates.  There was a bunch of punk rock kids.  So along with that potpourri of humanity I just described you had these guys from the mental institution.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Ah, that\\'s community for you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That was the Bronx.  That was the Bronx, man.  It was great.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Maybe you know handsome Dick from such pre- punk legendary bands as the dictators.  Dick grew up, where else, the Athens, the cultural geyser, the font of art and music that is the Bronx.  And back in the day like me, this was his special warm and happy place.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can go by and eat a full 2 1/2-hour meal, be stuffed, and see someone eating a white castle, I still want one.  You can forget mickey d\\'s.  You can forget Burger King.  You forget all those places.  If you need a White Castle scratch, none of the cheap places will do.  I can\\'t stop eating.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Bronx Academy of Letters is something of a cause for me.  An institution whose mission I see as absolutely vital.  If kids like these kids from a tough neighborhood, often coming from tough family situations, are going to do the things that they\\'re capable of, of having the things they want.  I believe that there is no way to realize your dreams if you can\\'t articulate them, if you can\\'t with words convince others to give you the opportunities, the chances you need to grasp.\\n\\n(on camera):  So I wanted to talk today -- really I\\'m going to tell you in a short period of time everything I know about writing.\\n\\n(voice over):  Today I\\'m dropping by in my role as substitute teacher.\\n\\n(on camera): I\\'m from Manhattan.  And I don\\'t know anything about the Bronx really.  I\\'m ridiculously, shamefully ignorant.  Do you think people know about the Bronx, what it\\'s like to grow up in the Bronx?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody perceives the Bronx as the emergence of hip-hop and all that, the culture.  But apart from that the Bronx is actually lively at all times.  At night, and in the morning.  You hear people screaming from outside your window.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I\\'ve grown up - since I was what, I think seven.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.  And it\\'s happened that way.  So, some community it\\'s likes the biggest thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I\\'ve been teaching here for eight years, and I think that what people forget is a lot of times we talk about this in class, they focus on lots of diseases, health issues, lack of education.  But I can be out with them just walking to the train to go to a field trip and they say hi to at least 30 people.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know everyone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What other Bronx specialties should I be paying attention to?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Montano\\'s.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That works for you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bacon tastes pretty good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I like bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a classic.  That\\'s a New York classic.  That\\'s sort of a bodega classic.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Love that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I walk outside and have the Italian Ice\\'s.  Soon when - as soon as like the weather gets nice and you hear Cohito, dames (ph) ...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  they\\'ve got the best.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what is - what is chopped cheese?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Chopped cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is chopped cheese?  I have to see.  Where does this come from?  This mutant cheese.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  This thing, whatever it is, it\\'ll do just fine.  As long as you\\'re reading Orwell\\'s essays while you\\'re eating it, kid.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it was somebody who experiments in their home.  Because it tastes so different than like a cheeseburger, which is what it kind of is actually.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People uptown or like downtown say chopped cheese and they\\'re like, what?  Like - here you\\'re like\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So this is a regional indigenous specialty.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And it\\'s newer, too, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It hasn\\'t been around that long.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve been everywhere in the world, and I mean just about everywhere in the world that you can think of.  As beautiful as many cities around the world are, it\\'s really in your blood, and particularly if you grew up here.  You\\'re living in Paris, you don\\'t want a chopped cheese sandwich.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER) BOURDAIN:  Maybe you\\'ll be angry that can\\'t get one.\\n\\n(on camera):  So there it is.  A peek, a narrow slice of an old, deep, and noble subject.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Causing the co-existence to morph into a vicious remorse these laws relentless illogical ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sitting right there, relatively unexplored.

       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, PARTS UNKNOWN HOST:  We go up this beautiful mountain.\\n\\nThis is incredible town.  It goes back to the 12th Century.  People charge (ph) up the hill to the beautiful church to take the walk that Michael Corleone had took.  Now and forever more it will be sort of the \"Godfather\" theme park where they\\'re just playing the \"Godfather\" theme over and over.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the most thoughtful Sicilians are disgusted by this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Imagine not waking up every day.\\n\\nAs one bus after another filled with Japanese tourists go up there, \"Oh, look, Michael Corleone got married there.  Oh, it\\'s so fantastic.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s one of the most beautiful places in Europe, a place whose roots are very much the roots of the town where I live.  But somehow I\\'ve never been able to get it right to tell the story -- any story of Sicily.  It\\'s the biggest island in the Mediterranean.  Two main towns are Palermo and Catania on opposite sides.\\n\\nI\\'ve done a show in Palermo before.  It was an epic goat rodeo, a failure of humiliating scale.  This time I was going to get it right.\\n\\nThere\\'s the Sicily we know from films -- an evocative, deeply felt history that\\'s not quite reality but cool anyway, right?  There\\'s the simple fact of its location tucked away under the boot of Italy, part of but not really part of that country.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE: (inaudible)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Its own language, culture, its own history of Norman, Arab, Spanish, Roman, Turkish, Egyptian interlopers, all leaving their mark and their influence.\\n\\nI grew up in New Jersey which was pretty much Sicily on the Hudson. The Italian-Americans next door weren\\'t from Milan.  I could tell you that much.  I guess what I\\'m telling you is I figured this will be easy.\\n\\nVilla Monaci delle Terre Nere, a certified Agriturismo, meaning it\\'s a hotel, restaurant and working farm that in this case produces olive oil.\\n\\nHow many acres of property do you have?\\n\\nGUIDO ALESSANDRO, OWNER, VILLA MONACI DELLE TERRE NERE: Tony, it\\'s about 40 acres.  It\\'s one of the oldest organic farm in the mountains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Guido, the proprietor.\\n\\nWow.  So that\\'s where potatoes come from.\\n\\nHow freaking hard can it be to make an awesome show in Sicily?  Eat the nice food, drink the wine in an idyllic villa in the countryside outside Catania.  How low-impact can it get?\\n\\nSo the plan was we go fishing. We get some fresh octopus, maybe some cuttlefish, explore the bounty of the surrounding waters, all while working on our tans with the local chef, fishermen, man of the sea. He\\'s experienced.  He knows where to get it good.\\n\\nTURE:  You like the urchin?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I love it.  How do you say it in Italian?\\n\\nTURE:  Ricci.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ricci.  Yes.\\n\\nTURE:  Ricci de mare.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It\\'s one of my favorite things to eat.\\n\\nThis is Ture, my host.\\n\\nWhat else is out there?  Octopus?\\n\\nTURE: Octopus, now it\\'s out.  Cuttlefish and I like (inaudible)  I want to try to find some small abalone, we call it orecchia di mare (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nice.\\n\\nTURE:  And also there\\'s clams.  Here the water is still cold.  I think they will be really full.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I\\'m thinking, really?  Are these prime fishing waters?  I don\\'t know about this. But all this boat traffic and all these people, so close to the action I can\\'t see much of anything living down there.\\n\\nTURE: OK.  Let\\'s anchor.  We anchor here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I am famous for my optimism so I dutifully suited up for what was advertised as a three-hour cruise.\\n\\nSo I get in the water, and I\\'m paddling around and splash.  Suddenly there\\'s a dead sea creature sinking slowly so the seabed in front of me. Are they kidding me?  I\\'m thinking, \"Can this be happening?\"  Splash. There\\'s another one.  Another rigor mortis half-frozen freaking octopus but it goes on, one dead cuttlefish, deceased octopus, frozen sea urchin after another, splash, splash, splash.\\n\\nEach specimen drops among the rocks or along the sea floor, to be heroically discovered by Ture moments later and proudly shown off to camera, like I\\'m not actually watching as this confederate in the next boat over hurls them into the water one after another.\\n\\nI\\'m no marine biologist, but I know dead octopus when I see one. Pretty sure they don\\'t drop from the sky and then sink straight to the bottom.\\n\\nTURE:  How many do we have -- octopus?  Three?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nTURE: OK.  I tried to get some patate now and also some (inaudible), small abalone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Strangely everyone pretends to believe the hideous sham unfolding before our eyes, doing their best to ignore the blindingly obvious.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nTURE:  Don\\'t swim at it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Then they gave up and just dumped the whole bag of dead fish into the sea.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At this point, I begin desperately looking for signs of life, hoping that one of them would start -- become revived.  I\\'m frantically swimming around the bottom littered with dead things looking for one that\\'s still twitching so can I hold it up to the camera and end this misery.  But, no, my shame will be absolute.\\n\\nFor some reason I feel something snap, and I slide quickly into a spiral of near hysterical depression.  Is this what it\\'s come to?  I\\'m thinking, \"Is this other dead squid narrowly misses my head?  Almost a decade later back in the same country, and I\\'m still desperately staging fishing scenes, seeding the oceans with supermarket seafood, complicit in a shameful, shameful incident of fakery?\"\\n\\nBut there I was, bobbing listlessly in the water.  Dead sea life sinking to the bottom all around me.  You\\'ve got to be pretty immune to the world to not see some kind of obvious metaphor.\\n\\nI\\'ve never had a nervous breakdown before.  But I tell you from the bottom of my heart something fell apart down there, and it took a long, long time after the end of this damn episode to recover.\\n\\nTURE:  And no longer.  We don\\'t need to boil.  We\\'ll be ready without it.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nTURE:  I\\'m cleaning it.  Only the fish eat this part.  Who wants to eat this one?\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Raw clams, abalone and a heart-warming beet sea surrounded by a gaggle of curious and hungry kids.  It was at this point about the only positive way for Ture to redeem himself.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ll notice, I\\'m not there.  I\\'m sitting in a nearby cafe pounding one Negrone after in a smoldering miserable rage.\\n\\nOur evening meal will be at Ture\\'s place Osteria Nero d\\'Avola which is just up the hill in Turmina, by the time dinner rolls around, I\\'m ripped to the -- did I mention it\\'s my birthday?  I\\'ve had three hours of bobbing around on a pitching boat, a couple more hours getting looped, two more hours lying on the sidewalk outside the restaurant while the crew hangs light so I\\'m gone, baby, gone.  I don\\'t remember any of this.  Any of it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So how is your day today?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good.  A nice boat trip, a little swim....\\n\\nI would be told later that a gentleman named Tomaso that joined me for dinner.  Also someone on the crew mentioned that his wife was present and that she didn\\'t say much.  Presumable because this was not her preferred way to spend her birthday.\\n\\nTURE:  Hi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hi.\\n\\nTURE:  Tony.  This is my passion.  I like to find that whole variety of olive and one of this is white.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So that\\'s the original?\\n\\nTURE:  Yes, the original.  You don\\'t find it anyplace else.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Apparently there were these white olives harvested from some secret tree only Ture knows about.  Maybe it\\'s next to his secret fishing hole.  There was great Sicilian wine apparently, and apparently I drank quite a lot of it.\\n\\nThere was bread and olive oil.  Abalone served raw in the shell, baby sardine called vionata (ph), also served raw with a splash of citrus and salt.\\n\\nTURE:  And this is vionata (ph), the baby sardine, totally raw without no match ingredients to taste better the fish.  Salud. BOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you ask a Sicilian, right, say where you come from?  The correct answer should be I\\'m Italian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  We say I\\'m Sicilian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?  Is Sicily, Italy?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Should it be?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t know, but we used to have influence from Britons, Normans, Arab, Spanish.  So basically we are a mix.  We\\'re a blender.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, look, my octopus.  I remember personally catching that one.  It was a mighty struggle, too.  No, actually I don\\'t.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  The octopus.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  Beautiful little shrimp.  Very tender, the octopus, very nice.\\n\\nAnd another traditional specialty.  I\\'m told they call this tuna tartar.  And cuttlefish -- I recognize you, my friend.  Now crudo like this, how traditional is this to Sicily?\\n\\nTURE:  I think from the part of the sea they almost eat it raw.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Always?\\n\\nTURE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But fisherman only, fishing communities only, or in restaurants?  Always since long as you\\'ve been alive.  You go to a restaurant you see crudo like this?\\n\\nTURE:  No.  I see crudo in the poor family.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s not like this Japanese influence, but the Japanese sort of gave everybody permission to eat traditional foods, their own traditional foods.  What are the great mother Sicilian classic dishes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The anchovy.  Anchovy and parmegiana.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  Parmegiana.\\n\\nTURE:  Pasta colisarde (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, that\\'s...\\n\\nTURE:  I think this is -- for me... BOURDAIN:  I ate with the sardine.\\n\\nTURE:  Yes.  But it\\'s an explosion of flower, because at this plate -- it\\'s Arab, born in the period when Sicily was very poor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This I like.  I even remember it.  Pasta (inaudible), actually a true Sicilian classic made with fennel, pine nuts, saffron and anchovy served alongside some sardines that have been curing in chestnuts and salt for days, then lightly fried in oil.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have to use our hand.  We have to use our hand to eat the fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No problem.\\n\\nI must have slump back to bed somehow, collapsed in a sodden drunken heap of self-loathing.  I would ordinarily have turned on the porn challenge and maybe loaded up on prescription meds.  But there\\'s no T.V. at the Agriturismo.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I love the films \"Godfather 1\" and \"Godfather 2\" but they had nothing to do with any organized crime from reality.  They\\'re opera -- magnificent opera but basically a morality tale about loyalty and destroying the things you claim to love and want to protect.\\n\\nActual organized crime members generally speaking a bunch of spectacularly uneducated lazy ass sociopaths who have no problem stealing from their own harder working neighbors.  Here in Sicily they are interested and less glamorous than gambling and prostitution. They are and have and traditionally have been a gigantic parasitical organism -- one that has now grown to be of mere equal size as its host.\\n\\nMary Taylor Simeti is originally from New York, but she\\'s been living here in Palermo for half a century now.  She\\'s a food writer and at one time a reformer for social justice which is a dicey thing to be here.\\n\\nYou\\'ve been here all this time?  Well, why?\\n\\nMARY TAYLOR SIMETI, FOOD WRITER:  Well, I came for a year.  It was going to be a year between college and graduate school.  I just finished college.  I met a man and therein lies the tale.  I married a Sicilian and has lived here ever since.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Piccolo Napoli is a restaurant like a lot of others around here except for the quality of its food.\\n\\nTell me about where are we, first of all.\\n\\nSIMETI:  OK.  The father and mother of the present owner opened this in 1951 when there was a wonderful photograph there on the wall of the opening day.  It started as really a tavern and has become a well- known and much appreciated restaurant now.  Now it\\'s very straightforward Sicilian cooking at its best.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We start with some typical things, the kind of things I deeply love, the kind of simple good things that make me happy. Panelli which is a fritter made from chickpeas, some caponata -- a sweet and sour eggplant dish, kind of like ratatouille but more Arab in influence -- a plate of olives husband white wine produced from a small batch vineyard run by Mary and her husband.\\n\\nThis is a panelli?\\n\\nSIMETI:  Panelli.  Chickpea flour probably come in with the Arabs, maybe even earlier, because chickpeas have been around for a long time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this is the famous caponata.\\n\\nSIMETI:  Caponata.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  About as Sicilian as it gets.\\n\\nSIMETI:  Yes.  That\\'s caponata and canoli the two internationally known Sicilian dishes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is what I\\'ve been waiting for.  This is what I wanted Sicily to be, something to soothe my shattered soul.  It doesn\\'t take much, a bowl of good pasta.  In this case the famous spaghetti al nero di sepia, spaghetti and cuttlefish, also some (inaudible) pasta with swordfish, eggplant, and tomatoes.\\n\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Perfect.  Perfect pasta.  Very happy with that.\\n\\nSIMETI:  Good.  I know you\\'ve been looking forward to it so I\\'m glad it\\'s good.  Palermo\\'s an expensive city for some things because the consumer is paying...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More.\\n\\nSIMETI:  ... more so that the store can afford to pay its extortion money.  The big change that has happened is that up until the mid- \\'80s, the late \\'80s, there were a great many Sicilians who thought if they were honest and didn\\'t have anything to do with the Mafia, they could live without being affected by the Mafia.  Apparently, 80 percent of the businesses in Palermo and 70 percent in the rest of Italy that pay extortion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a lot.\\n\\nSIMETI:  That\\'s a lot.  That\\'s a lot. BOURDAIN:  But not everybody pays the bite.  A small but growing coalition of businesses have joined a group called Addio Pizzo, a grassroots organization taking a stand against the Mafia\\'s traditional mere total control over the food chain, from farm to table.\\n\\nI come out of the restaurant business in New York.  You got taxed with every laundry order every time they took your trash away.  It was built in to all your basic services.\\n\\nSIMETI:  Here it\\'s much more going around.  Christmas and Easter.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A guy comes by.\\n\\nSIMETI:  The guy comes by.  I mean, it\\'s plain and simple extortion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Given that that\\'s a pretty straightforward situation, some of these guys who banded together for Addio Pizzo, I mean, what happens, the guy shows up and says I\\'m not paying you.  What happens next?\\n\\nSIMETI:  Well, apparently now the Mafia has decided that it isn\\'t worthwhile bothering with the people who belong to Addio Pizzo. There\\'s so many others out there and why look for trouble.  How true it is, I don\\'t know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSIMETI:  To belong to Addio Pizzo, you have to sign a pledge that you will not pay and that if you are approached, you will go to the police.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSIMETI:  Then they send you to lawyers and to another organization which deals with the people who are actually having trouble.  It\\'s incredibly complicated.  I mean, there are no easy answers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSIMETI:  I mean what about big farm?  What about some of the things that are -- that are happening on a much more legitimate level?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, who is more destructive worldwide?  I mean, yes, you can make a very good argument.\\n\\nSIMETI:  That\\'s horrible.  I\\'m upset because I sound as if I\\'m making apologies for the Mafia.  It\\'s just I think what has happened, that having lived 50 years in Sicily, I\\'m much more skeptical than most Americans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSIMETI:  I don\\'t know the...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I know what you\\'re saying.  You\\'re saying you\\'re not so sure that a Mafia-free Italy would be that much more functional? SIMETI:  Well, absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not so sure.\\n\\nSIMETI:  I\\'m not so sure at all.\\n\\nBut I am constantly amused by the fact that 45 years ago, if I said to Americans, \"I live in Sicily.\" They\\'re fascinated (ph).  How did a nice girl like you end up in a place like that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really.\\n\\nSIMETI:  Now it\\'s -- \"On a farm in Sicily, how romantic.  Oh, I envy you.\"  So perception of Sicily...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It has changed.\\n\\nSIMETI:  ... has changed enormously.  Enormously.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 2007 there were only 160 Addio Pizzo members, now over 800.  Pretty cool considering we\\'re talking about a group who have demonstrated no regret or hesitation in killing judges, politicians, police, prosecutors.\\n\\nBack to Catania, and when you\\'re talking late-night dining options, you\\'re talking one thing.  The enticing smell of smoke wafting through the streets, a smell that\\'s enticingly equine.  I smell rainbow dash.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Yes.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Anthony and Marco, a couple of Sicilians and aficionados of Macelleria Equina.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is (inaudible) and (inaudible).  It\\'s one of the older side, famous, you know, pro-families of Mafia, you know, that grows in crime organization here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, right here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And now these things -- yes, yes, yes.  Nowadays seems to be like a bit more quiet because they are all getting arrested so they prefer to sell meat against drugs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So right over there you can bet on a horse?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can bet horses, yes.  People like to bet horse and you eat the one that lose.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The loser goes on the fire.  That\\'s not a nice thing, but, I mean, sometimes it happens for real.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cycle of life.  All right. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So why horse?  Where does this tradition come from?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe also the Egyptians, then we have Greeks, 750 years before Christ.  Then we have Romans because we have to say that Sicilians are big bastards.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of course, we\\'re being conquered by everybody, also our dialect.  There are many words that are understood by our people.  If I say a Sicilian dialect word, maybe an Arab can understand me, an Italian no, because Italian language comes from Latin, something different.\\n\\nWe are Sicilians before to be Italians.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Remember this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (inaudible) I\\'ll never forget.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Look at this opposite (ph) side of the meat.  It\\'s yellow, it\\'s not white.  When it\\'s yellow, it means that the horse has been breaded, eating fresh grass.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Who wants to eat?\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Perfecto.  OK.  Thanks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Prepare and go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  You like the taste?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a bit sweet.  You don\\'t need nothing.  The horse meat basically is loved by quite everybody here, you know. (inaudible) you can have -- we can have also meat balls, Anthony, we can have a horse meat ball.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As you wish, man.  Whatever. I\\'ll try it...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whatever, I\\'ll try anything.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some mix of different things, you know.  Scramble of bread, parmesan cheese, pecorino...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ... parsley, eggs, and, of course, horse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Horse.  Everything\\'s very tasty.\\n\\nLet\\'s put it this way.  When my daughter asks me for a pony, I\\'m bringing her here, pointing at that grill and saying here is your pony.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Parco dei Nebrodi is a national park and within that is this free range pig farm.  They breed these special heritage pigs here -- the black boar of Nedbrodi.  A combination of wild Sicilian boar and domesticated swine thought to have been brought here from Spain long ago, this breed of pig is raising the profile of the pig here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Smell of shit everywhere.  Look, look, they hear now, the noise of the car they will arrive.  Fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But any good-tasting high-quality pig, the secret is largely what were they fed?  How did they live?  Were they happy?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m a hunter.  I\\'ve never seen so many in once. It\\'s like I feel...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You should be shooting something.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  (inaudible)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A poorly fed pig who lived his life in squalor, stress and fear makes poor bad pork.  This is why we should treat animals well, not just because that\\'s the nice thing to do, but because it makes them provably more delicious.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chestnuts, acorns, roots and stuff foraged from the hills, supplemented by some nice fattening grain during the winter months when wild food is less easy and less plentiful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They catch here the animal only with the traps.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a shame that they don\\'t let you shoot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like pigs.  Not to hang out with, to eat.  I don\\'t have a tattoo of a pig or anything, but I like them fine.  And when given the opportunity to shoot one in the brain or see one shot in the brain so that I may suck on its entrails and other parts, I\\'m down.  That\\'s what\\'s called cheering me up from some manic depression.\\n\\nBang.  And this pig is like Pauly, you won\\'t see him no more.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Even with the brain dead, the heart still goes on beating, sort of like pick a Kardashian.  In the case, however, the last few beats of the heart are absolutely necessary to pump all that red, red crabby (ph) into a bucket for Sanguinacco.  The salt helps keep it from coagulating prematurely.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can do it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  That\\'s so fast.  Incredible.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There was a Kardashian joke there somewhere.  Kim gets ready for the big day.  It\\'s date night at Khloe\\'s house.  Real housewife gets ready for summer.  Grooming tips from Teresa Guidice. I got a million of them.  Let\\'s hope Kanye never has to see this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We hang now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bye.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Bye.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Then get to work.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very fast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All those good bits, the lungs, kidneys, they get cooked slowly in fat with garlic, chili pepper, a little wine.\\n\\nIs the meat also what the liver?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  Yes, liver, oil -- a bit of this and that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s interior with a little bit of fat?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The interior with a little bit of the fat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a pork confit.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (inaudible)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s pretty.\\n\\nMeanwhile the intestinal casings get filled with blood and gently poached until creamy bloody delicious.  And a nice spread of homemade cured meats, local cheese and homemade wine.  Let the party begin.\\n\\nSo what do we have here?  Let\\'s identify these products.  Capicolo.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Capicolo.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s the Spanish...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Prosciutto.  Yes.  Lardo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lardo.  Pancetta.  That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The cheese is local, it\\'s provolone.  This is the ricotta and just cooked in the oven.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The bread?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The bread is from the ankle, and they have also salami and they have sausages.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this cheese?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cannistrato.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And what do you call that dish?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ... just on a pan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Beautiful.  That\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The best moment of the day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Indeed.  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What did you think about this?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good.  For me the ricotta, it\\'s really good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s a country -- this place.  You discover Sicily, and I expect that that very few people know this is incredible, even the bread is the old lady that she made.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think of Sicily, you think of family, you think of food.  This is more like it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'ll stop here for the train (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Catania, the early morning market.  It\\'s been going on for longer than America has as a country.  It\\'s old, old Italia.\\n\\nDo they know you here?  Do you shop here often?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is not Tomaso\\'s first trip to the market by a long shot.  His mom is a regular.  She comes here almost every day.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And this is the next stock market you can find here everything.  Each butcher, more likely they have their own specialty.  Fresh ingredients, you know.  You know, they...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They do lamb?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, they do lamb, sausage, the hamburger, the (inaudible).  This is pig (inaudible), at least six months old, at least, over here.  This is the place where she buy the spices for her home, and the veggies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is what the market is best known for -- seafood.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This one is one of the biggest sellers that we have in the fish market.  You can see also the variety.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We consider the tuna like a pig.  We don\\'t throw away anything.  See, this is typical.  You can find it all here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Those are the tiny, tiny little clams.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right. This is the thing (inaudible) In Sicilians they\\'re called (inaudible).  You can see the shrimp are still alive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So I see sepia?   Baby...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, baby sardines.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Swordfish.  I\\'m joining Tomaso for lunch today.  Mom\\'s cooking, so we\\'ve got to do some shopping.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They look beautiful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The color is beautiful.\\n\\n(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED MALE:  Bon jour.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we\\'ll go have some today, so shrimp.  And...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And baby sardines.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gracias.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll tell you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you want to try?  The blood sausage?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Saukernaut?  Just blood, no onion, no spice, nothing?  What you -- a little salt, a little pepper?  You squeeze it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  Italiano?  Crepa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (inaudible).  Oh, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Interesting runner up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s good.\\n\\nUsually I don\\'t like it plain, I like it in a sauce and spicy.  That\\'s good.  It\\'s very tasty.  Looks like hell.  Tastes like heaven.  If you like this, you\\'re Sicilian.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Very, very.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t have any grandparents.  My mom, I guess she cooks, but the last time she ever invited me for dinner was like 1972.  So given that tragic, dysfunctional, too much information kind of history is it any mystery why I\\'m always on the lookout for grandma? Anybody\\'s grandma will do.\\n\\nHell, I\\'ve been known to cruise rural state highways looking for hitch-hiking grannies to abduct so they\\'ll cook for me.  And given my fragile emotional state it makes perfect sense that I\\'d dragoon Tomaso\\'s mom into making me a nice lunch.  Is that heartwarming or like creepy and sad?\\n\\nHey.  It smells good in here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let\\'s go open a wine in the meantime.  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Need any help chopping parsley?  Yes, perfect.\\n\\nFor lunch we\\'ve got the shrimp and sardines from earlier at the market, but first this.\\n\\nJust grab one?  It\\'s like Arancini but with hole owed out potatoes filled with cheese, breaded and fried.  Delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Basically, when it finish the bread is ready and you fill it with all the cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They deep into the hands to seal the potatoes...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right. UNIDENTIFED MALE:  ... and then crumple it and fry.\\n\\nMy mother cooks for everybody, even if it was midnight.  My parents are also was the parents of friends over my friends.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we have to do something, we want to share some time all together and they have a dinner, my mother is cooking for everybody.  Because the problem is when she cook, even if she know it\\'s only for five people, she cooking for...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  10?  Just in case.\\n\\nMore caponata.  This is Sicily, after all.  And this is the classic starter.  Also, a bread and tomato salad.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Would you like to try something?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s old school.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because of the bread.  We use bread that a harder. We usually do bread that is two days old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  It\\'s really good.  Really, really good.  That\\'s Sicily right there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fresh shrimp sauteed in garlic, butter, and herbs.  I have noticed over time as I travel around the world that every great and enlightened culture, when they are confronted with the shrimp or a prawn -- right away.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s the way you see if it\\'s fresh or not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  So typical day, when you were 15 years old what did you eat for lunch?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Never missing a pasta for lunch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pasta and meat...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... or pasta and fish?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And fish.  Of course, something local.  Basically you have to go right behind the corner to find your products.  So whatever we could produce in Sicily, that\\'s what we choose to buy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Watch this.  Zip the bone right out.  Out comes all the bone.  Who needs a knife?\\n\\nSardines filleted neatly, sauteed in garlic and oil, a little red pepper.  That\\'s a beautiful thing right there. UNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  Sir.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll tell you, another two hours here I\\'ll be speaking Italian.  Well, speak Sicilian.  Yes, you have to eat it hot.  This is very nice.  If you don\\'t like this, there\\'s really no hope for you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If there\\'s something that you don\\'t like it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everything is...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tell her.  Tell her because --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m so happy.  This is a delicious meal.  And to eat in this beautiful home with some really good home cooked food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFED FEMALE:  OK.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My last night in Sicily.  And after this I\\'m going back to New York crawling under my bed and adopting the fetal position for like six weeks.\\n\\nCould I cut some vegetables.\\n\\nI may look normal -- OK, I don\\'t exactly.  But I\\'m not barking uncontrollably or running around shrieking with my pants wrapped around my head which is what my instincts are telling me I should be doing.\\n\\nTo me one of life\\'s great joys is cheese.  No, I\\'m eating cheese which makes me happy always -- and drinking wine -- good wine -- and a hell of a lot of it. And I\\'ll just make it over the hump with any luck at all.\\n\\nWe have a mozzarella here, a peperoncino.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We got one on the meal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I will.\\n\\nTure joins me for a final meal along with Antonio, Guido and Guido\\'s girlfriend Ara.\\n\\nThis is an Agriturismo.  This is not a concept that exists in America. But it is a concept that should exist.  OK, now please explain what it is?\\n\\nALESSANDRO:  Agriturismo is a hotel linked to the territory.  You have to use local product, local recipe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Penne, sun dried tomatoes, zucchini, all from the farm. Man, that looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow, wow, wow, fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Some nice rabbit, olive oil also from the farm, more wine. I might just make it.\\n\\nWhat now, this is called  crivoi agrodolce, sweet and bitter.  If you talk about Italy, it is the most interesting aspect of Italian cuisine.  I mean just gastronomically but philosophically because it is a philosophical thing.  Life is too good.  I need a little bitterness to remind myself of the internal tragedy of our existence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, right for fact the sweet and sour of the life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One final attempt before I go to extract something meaningful on what it means to be Sicilian.\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with these people in the north?\\n\\nALESSANDRO:  People from the south are coming from these Greek street culture where the philosopher while in the north came through and also very...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That\\'s the meanest thing anyone can say.\\n\\nALESSANDRO:  ... very practical people and figured out that the last century the three best writers in Italy are come Sicily.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they consider us a weight when there are problems.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But finally on summer, they all come here to make maggots.  It\\'s a good thing for us, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: In the end, it all comes back to the \"Godfather.\"  We go up this beautiful mountain, this incredible town.  It goes back to the 12th Century.  There are few places on earth more beautiful.  But there we are sitting in one of the -- it was like a \"Godfather\" theme park.\\n\\n\"Look, Michael Corleone got married there.  It\\'s so fantastic.\"\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, we just look at these people with the \"Godfather\" T-shirt and talk and I would say\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And say oh, my god.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why people get stuck on this, I love the \"Godfather\" movie because there is this big sense of a fact.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Michael had many options.  He destroyed his family.  Then everybody, everything he touched.\\n\\nALESSANDRO: In a way it\\'s fair. BOURDAIN: It\\'s fair?\\n\\nALESSANDRO: Coppola did  good movie, for sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Coppola, he didn\\'t -- it up. No.\\n\\nALESSANDRO: No?  No?\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, TALKING ABOUT THAILAND: I remember the moment I first realized I've been living my whole life in black and white. It was like discovering a color I never knew existed before. A whole\\n\\nnew crayon box full of colors, that was it for me. From then on, there was no putting the pieces back together. No going home. Things were different now. Asia had ruined me for my old life.\\n\\n(BEGIN OPENING SONG)\\n\\nI took a walk through this beautiful world felt the cool rain on my shoulder found something good in this beautiful world I felt the rain getting colder. Sha La La La La Sha La La La La La  Sha La La La La Sha La La La La La La\\n\\n(END OF OPENING SONG)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whiskey.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, that's good. Trying to kill us. They make more than 100 bottles a day so 30,000 bottles. That's a lot of -- did I do that right? Or have I had too many whiskeys? How did this happen? How did I get here?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Coming into focus, the man across the table. He looks familiar. Maybe if I can remember who he is, it will be a clue as to where I am.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. Andy. Andy Ricker. The white guy who cooks awesome Thai food.\\n\\nANDY RICKER, THAI FOOD COOK: Pretty spicy? Put that in there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The Pok Pok in Portland, restaurants in New York. Andy has made a name for himself faithfully reproducing the cuisine of Northern Thailand. The good stuff comes from places like here. Rice country. Chiang Mai Province. In this part of the world, you live and die by the harvest. Thai food is intensely regional. In Northern Thailand in particular, has many distinctive features. This is a world of fresh, delicious, spicy, meaty, salty, sour, sweet, bitter. Often with a just-picked herby dimension. And always the most vital thing, giver of life, sticky rice. Andy here is constantly back and forth from America to Thailand, for nearly 25 years now, looking for recipes, techniques, digging deeper and deeper into an amazingly complex and widely misunderstood cuisine. And getting his ass chastised by a few aunties as he goes. On this trip, Andy's working on a new cook book, investigating the eating and drinking culture of the region. Which might be why he thought of me and why we're drinking shine for breakfast. Where there's food, there's also going to be booze. And likely, a lot of it.\\n\\nRICKER: This is Nempik Ong. We make a chili paste with chilies, garlic, shallot, shrimp paste and tomatoes. And then you mix it with pork.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's for you. OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah. I think it's awesome.\\n\\nRICKER: Isn't it delicious? This rice is grown here in the village. You just kind of make a little spoon-shaped ball with it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Now, what's the famous greeting? Is it have you eaten yet or have you had rice?\\n\\nRICKER: It's both. Literally it means have you eaten rice yet. But what it literally means is how's it going.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It is assumed that if you haven't eaten yet, things are not going well. If you have eaten, rice is such a fundamental component.\\n\\nRICKER: Eating is synonymous with eating rice. To eat a meal without rice would be unthinkable.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What makes their whiskey seem special?\\n\\nRICKER: Because of the flavoring that they add to it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN Conveniently, our hosts in addition to having provided us with a fine meal, just so happen to run a distillery out back.\\n\\nRICKER: They use a spice mixture they add to the yeast balls, let it ferment for five days, and then she smashes it with a wood mallet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thai rice whiskey, Lao khao, bucket of hooch, whatever you want to call it, this stuff is a delightful beverage that taste better and smoother, apparently, the more you drink. Here  we go.\\n\\nRICKER: And then fried fish. I believe it's called Nile tilapia or Nile carp. It s salt the hell out of it and deep fry it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good stuff. Hmm.\\n\\n(SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BOURDAIN: This guy's trying to kill us.\\n\\nRICKER: Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok, ok.\\n\\n(SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: For my uncle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: For your uncle, yes.\\n\\nRICKER: 69 years old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Looking good.\\n\\nRICKER: He drinks half a bottle every day. So, it's pretty much the Keith Richards health and preservation plan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right. Will we get healthy, too. The whiskey, I have to say, is taking hold. In some clinically fascinating ways.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Funny.\\n\\nRICKER: I lost the plot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, that's OK. It all comes back to me as the world shifts and tilts.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Although I'd been looking out a lot of hotel windows these days struggling to figure out where I am, being here, throwing back shots of rice whiskey with these guys, I know I'm back in Thailand.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Not just Thailand, but Northern Thailand. Once known as kingdom of a million rice fields, it's a fertile, green and gorgeous area, home of the ancient Latta people. Welcome to Chiang Mai Province, tucked up near the borders of Burma, China, Laos, India not too far away. All of them have left their mark on the food.\\n\\nRICKER: Here's the local hooch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And if you're eating here, chances are, you're also drinking.\\n\\nRICKER: Compared to the stuff we had this morning, this is substantially more harsh, I would say. And less fragrant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The village of May Yon. In this place is called Hin Tang. How did you find this place? We're in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nRICKER: It's a very popular place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A restaurant showcasing one of the distinguishing elements of Northern Thai cuisine, the heavy use of animal protein.\\n\\nRICKER: You see the local people, they're ling up. Here in Northern Thailand, pig reigns supreme. So, most of the stuff we're eating here is made out of pig.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What did you order?\\n\\nRICKER: Grilled pig tail.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That sounds superb.\\n\\nRICKER: Yep. And then we ordered some sai oua(ph) Northern Thai herbal pork sausage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yeah, I'm on that.\\n\\nRICKER: Brain. Some pig's brain.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah. I'm not a big brain fan. A custardy sort of texture, coupled with this sort of nutty taste. Frankly, I'd sooner grab a big handful of nut sack, so to speak.\\n\\nRICKER: It's mixed with a curry paste and some herbs and stuff, thrown into a banana leaf and then grilled. It's like eating scrambled eggs. You'll love it. Then we ordered new raw blood soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Raw. What do you mean, they don't cook it?\\n\\nRICKER: They do not cook the blood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: They put it into a hot soup.\\n\\nRICKER: No. This is raw blood.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really.\\n\\nRICKER: There's two kinds that you can get here. One is the addition of ki ang(ph) which means young shit. So, it's basically the partially digested juice that's made from when a cow eats grass.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Shit juice. Oh, geez. Oh, no. I did not order that. We're not having that.\\n\\nRICKER: OK. We're not having that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: We're not having that.\\n\\nRICKER: OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I'm thinking we'll stick to the plain blood soup, thank you very much.\\n\\nRICKER: The way that they make it is they take the raw blood and they scrunch it with lemon grass for a long time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. RICKER: Because that kind of kills the gamey flavor of the blood,\\n\\nhelps with the coagulation and adds flavor. Then they actually make chopped lab. That meats that's raw, that goes in. Bunch of deep-fried krunai(ph) or innards.\\n\\n(SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: Here it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You're not kidding. That's like a horror movie. Like CSI soup. I'm eating out of an open wound. Actually, that's completely delicious. Utterly delicious.\\n\\nRICKER: That makes you look like a vampire. It's quite spicy. You can taste the chili. It doesn't really taste like blood. It just kind of tastes sweet and rich. Let's see if we can change your mind about brains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Delicious. I'm not lying. This is delicious. Anyone would completely love this.\\n\\nRICKER: You eat too much of it, you'll go blind. That's what they think. It has to do with parasites and all kinds of stuff.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Huh?\\n\\nRICKER: Can I tell you some stories.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Whoa, back up there. Parasites?\\n\\nRICKER: Two or three years ago, a whole family in Nan Province, all seven of them died.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You probably should have told me that during the appetizer course, OK? Honestly, best food I ever had in Thailand, ever.\\n\\nRICKER: I'm super happy to hear that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I'd eat it out of (inaudible) jockstrap on a hot summer's day. This is CNN. Oh, god.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: In Chiang Mai you can move in and out. From the quiet green of the countryside to just a few miles away, the madness and chaos of Chiang Mai City. Second largest in Thailand. Spirituality, reflection, the serene beauty of the rice paddy, village life. Maybe next episode. This time, it's all about consuming medically inadvisable amounts of food and drink. If Thailand is one of the best countries to eat in, in Chiang Mai it's a particularly good city to find yourself hungry. Oh, that's the frog.\\n\\nRICKER: That's the frog. It's basically taking that frog, grill him first, hack it up, fry the living bollocks out of it with garlic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Mm. There's almost an inverse relationship, like the more hideous looking the dish, the more delicious it is. As you probably noticed by now, the food here is not Pad Thai or green curry chicken. There are complex layers of flavor, sophisticated balances, spicy, sour, a little bitter, salty, herby. Color and texture are important. Crispy, soft, cold, hot. It's exactly this interplay between elements that makes Northern Thai food so thrilling and so addictive.\\n\\nRICKER: This place is called La Gouchung Cha. Larb is the dish that they're known for it's just a mints means solid(ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What is that curry material?\\n\\nRICKER: That's one of the many stomachs of the cow. Might be the third stomach. Mine's bitter. It means it has a little bit of bile. The gentleman over there, uncle, he's the larb master. They win lard competitions. They're killing it, they're supporting a whole damn of family. The woman that just took the order, her family and her husband this guys who's a cashier, the uncle's -- when it gets really busy, the rest of the family comes and helps.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You famously said that you hate the word authentic. What does that word mean?\\n\\nRICKER: Depends on the context. If you're in the United States and you say traditional authentic Thai restaurant, to me that has come to mean a standard Thai restaurant in America. That menu. When you come here, authentic is different. You're the daughter of the woman who made this, then to you this is the most authentic version of that dish. If you are from Nan province, you still make larb but it doesn't taste like this. A little bit different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This larb is amazing. Friday night and Chiang Mai comes alive.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thailand, we will come. We love you!\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Andy has promised to compressed eating and drinking grand tour of the city. A bounce by Tuk-Tuk from one place to the other until we simply can't take it no more. Next stop, it ain't flavor town. It's some place beyond that, man. Way beyond.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to Thailand and happy day here in Chiang Mai.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: On your mark, get set, go. Cheers. This may surprise you, but I am not an alcoholic. I don't drink at home ever. There's no beer in my fridge. If I'm not working, I'm not hanging out in bars. But if I was an alcoholic, and I did hang in bars, I would hang here.\\n\\nRICKER: Some karaoke, maybe?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Even though the very mention of karaoke makes my blood run cold with fear.\\n\\n(SINGING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You had the French fries? RICKER: Yes, I did.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Apparently it's indigenous specialty.\\n\\nRICKER: In Thailand, it's probably one of the most popular menu items. They always have food to eat when you drink.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What is the whiskey we're drinking, by the way? I really haven't paid attention.\\n\\nRICKER: The whiskey we're drinking here is actually rum.\\n\\n(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This guy's good.\\n\\nRICKER: It's one of the great things about a place like this. You'll never have to fill your own glass.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That could be me some day, I'm thinking. Things go just a little wrong, I go off the rails, this would be all too attractive. I could well see myself singing happy birthday in German to tourists at a hotel bar in Jakarta or Bangkok. I enjoy my time quite, this is a fantastic discovery. This is gonna stick in my head now, this song.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Chiang Mai at night. We are well on our way. To where, to what, I don't know, I don't much care. But I do know it's time to eat. In Thailand it's almost always a time to eat. Yes, and drink. We shall be doing that, too.\\n\\nRICKER: The inevitable ice and beer. Way to drink beer in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Beer, you say? Oh, all right. In the interest of research, of course.\\n\\nRICKER: You got beer, you got booze, you got ice, you got some grilled meat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Snackage? Yes, I would like snacks.\\n\\nRICKER: They've got pork chin and intestines. Got a spice dipping sauce. Ah, this is a Chinese liquor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, tastes like medicine.\\n\\nRICKER: Yes. It also tastes like a dirty sock.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: When did you come to Thailand first?\\n\\nRICKER: I believe it was 1987. And I came as a backpacker. It was all about smoking dope on the beach, eating mushrooms, chasing girls and drinking beer. I had a three-month ticket and ended up staying away for four years. Here we go. BOURDAIN: Oh, man. So, what was the dish? A dish in every traveler's\\n\\nlife where they just said OK, my previous life is not gonna be enough for me anymore, you know?\\n\\nRICKER: There's a particular mushroom. They make soup out of it. It was unlike anything I had ever had in my life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: When I first came out to this part of the world, noodles. I mean, I knew right then. I mean, I'm not joking. It wasn't the girls, it wasn't the beaches. The noodles, the greasy bottle of fish sauce and the smell. There's this terrible moment where you realize I can't share this. That's it.\\n\\nRICKER: In about five seconds we will go past a woman who has a cowboy hat on.\\n\\n(SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The lady with the hat stands out among the dozens of street vendors across from the old city's north gate.\\n\\nRICKER: The best Khao Kha Moo or stewed pork leg in the city. Potentially none finer in Thailand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, are we going? Are we doing that? For years, she's been serving this. Khao Kha Moo slowly stewed pork.\\n\\nRICKER: She cooks it in a master sauce,(inaudible) master sauce, where you cook it in the same thing. It probably goes back at least a generation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Like sherry, there's a little bit of the original batch still in there.\\n\\nRICKER: Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Just hacking dead (ph) meat all day and there's like not a drop on the frilly...\\n\\nRICKER: This is a sauce that goes with it. It's kind of like a sour chili sauce. And then, you got to have some of these pickled mustard greens, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That's really tasty.\\n\\nRICKER: This place is just famous as hell. Half the people here are tourists, probably Chinese tourists.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Let's do it.\\n\\nRICKER: You want to stick your feet in some fish water?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No.\\n\\nRICKER: No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right. Let's go, guys. I need to stop at a sports bar. I need to have some chicken wings. I need to have some like fried mozzarella sticks. I need to go to a gun range, more beer, more food.\\n\\nRICKER: If you go on the sidewalk it will take us like ten minutes to get 50 feet. So, kind of stay to your right and don't get killed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What was I saying? Oh, yes. Beer loves crispy. Beer loves salty. Beer loves fatty. Spicy, salty, fried, together? Happiness.\\n\\nRICKER: OK. No beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK. What are they drinking?\\n\\nRICKER: They're drinking water.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Clear, kidney cleaning water. So, good, and so important to a healthy lifestyle. I would imagine. Midnight nam prik num That's what you do after you've had a few drinks -- maybe a lot of drinks, meaning a lot of drinks, because what you need, maybe you didn't know you need it but you do, is Nam Prik, Thai Chili dip.\\n\\nRICKER: Yeah. Nam prik is what the vast majority of Thai people who live in America who come to Thailand to visit and go back end up getting busted at the airport for trying to bring in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: We get two kinds. Nam Prik Tua Daeng.\\n\\nRICKER: It's a combination of chilis, garlic, shrimp paste, dried fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And this.\\n\\nRICKER: Colloquially (ph) known midnight nam prik num.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Create from roasted green chillies, accompanied by God's preferred delivery systems for beer-friendly goodness. A whole bunch of deep-fried little salty meaty delicious things, yes, please.\\n\\nYes. And something I loved from the first mouthful I ever had right here in Chiang Mai all those years ago, Thai pork sausage.\\n\\nRICKER: Crispy, meaty, salty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I love it. I want to rub it all over my body. This sauce is just so amazing. Somehow the thing you need right now. This is totally the thing I need right now. Oh, that's so good.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK, come to me, my love, right now, you big nasty unfamiliar semi-cooked egg. Oh, that's so good. I once wrote your body isn't a temple, it's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride. But that was before I had a daughter and a respectable job at CNN. So, when that little voice in my head, said call it a night, quit while you're ahead, I probably should have listened. Wait, where did we leave off? Ah, yes, now I remember. Bouncing to one bar after another.\\n\\nRICKER: We're going that way. Which way?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That way.\\n\\nRICKER: OK. Good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Andy and I have clearly tuk-tuked our way well beyond the threshold of acceptable conduct. But we call it a night, quit while we're ahead? No.\\n\\nRICKER: We're gonna head over to see a Time-Honored tradition.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen...\\n\\nRICKER: The lady boy cabaret.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Let's do that. All right. Here it is. Lady boys, as they're known in Thailand, have led to many an embarrassing moment for the amorous cowboy too buzzed to notice or care much about the details.\\n\\nRICKER: My first experience with this kind of an atmosphere in Thailand happened in Ko Pha Ngan in the 1987. I met this girl and I was like stoked because it was like oh, she's into me and like at some point she sat on my lap and she's like oh, well, I have to go now, I have to go do something. She gave me a kiss. I was like I'm in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nRICKER: And the show started. You have to forgive a guy for making a mistake.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Many of the lady boys frankly are pretty spectacular looking, especially the ones who have breasts.\\n\\nRICKER: You know the women are harshing the buzz. It should be a guy thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Absolutely.\\n\\nRICKER: They should have a sports bar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Actually, that's a brilliant idea. A lady boy show in a sports bar. You can watch football, drink a lot of beer and around beer number eight, bring out the lady boys.\\n\\nJust my luck. At a show like this, what happens? Like she says. I end up kissing the one lady boy in Thailand who looks like Ernest Borgnine straight on the lips. Of course, I am completely oblivious to the day- glow white lipstick all over my face. Out of context photos of me here tonight end up on the internet. This could look bad. Watch the show. Oh, yeah.\\n\\nTotally going home alone, by the way. Just want to make sure that's established to the company. In spite of all evidence to the contrary.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nRICKER: Snacks?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Snacks. Let's go eat. This train has long ago come off the rails. One bar after another. It's time Andy and I head to an appropriate follow-up to a night like we've had. More food, quickly, this has become an emergency situation. There it is. Drunken noodles dude.\\n\\nRICKER: Pad kimao is actually not a noodle dish. Something served with rice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How can it be drunken noodles with no noodles? This is what we need, whatever it is.\\n\\nRICKER: It's something devised for drunken people to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That's us. Something to sop up the roiling tide of (inaudible) sloshing around in my stomach, and I need to sober up in case Ernest Borgnine calls. She said she'd call. I feel so used.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: I live in town, in the north they love to eat pork here. Look at all the damn chilis. There's a lot of chilis here. We got these fresh red ones. We've got these green ones that are sliced and stir- fried in there. Then we've got small green peppers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: Whoa! That's hot. Whew! I breathed in, got hit with the chili.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah.\\n\\nRICKER: Down the side of the throat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah. You know when you have been really hit by super hot and you feel like having a brain hemorrhage? It's like an ice cream headache but like a pepper headache.\\n\\nRICKER: Yeah. And your vision starts to tunnel out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You're halfway through and you're aware that your hair has just burst into flames. That perfect balance of pain and pleasure and more pain, brain flooding with endorphins and all is well with the world, until tomorrow morning. So, I've had a couple cocktails. Maybe we should like totally get a tattoo tomorrow, man.\\n\\nRICKER: Magic tattoos.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Time for bed.\\n\\nSo, I woke up in a state of confusion and deep concern after inadvertently making out with Ernest Borgnine last night. I have spiraled into some identity crisis. Inadvertently making out with Ernest Borgnine, I would like to say. It was very dramatic. I need to go to a strip club and watch a football game, mow the lawn and barbecue all at the same time. I hope some of you moved on. I don't mean that in a figurative way. I can't talk. It hurts to talk. Get out. Every region has sort of an iconic dish. They're talking the word of Thailand, Chiang Mai. This is it, hearty broth of curry, coconut, noodles and spices. I'm all over that. Oh, yeah. Mm. Needs some more onions. The boys at the bar tonight are going to be in for a surprise if they move in for a smooch. Damn, that's good. I am a big believer in a healthy nutritious breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day. My doctor said that. Of course, he also said that just about everything I love and hold dear is killing me, so what does he know. Attention, hippies. This is a salad. Clean papaya salad, that's not really a local thing. It's a piece of something but I couldn't resist. Spicy papaya salad, some (inaudible) I got to find a Catholic church. Bless me, father, for I have sinned. I kissed a man on the mouth. Oh, it burns like the fires of hell. Burn away sin. Burn away.      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: OK. Last mealtime, last lap, stagger across the finish line.\\n\\nRICKER: Meow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Andy's favorite spot in Chiang Mai. A family-run restaurant named Auntie Deng's Hammered Meat, and the jokes pretty much write themselves, folks.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, every year, every year. Andy has been coming here forever since it was only Auntie Deng's slightly slapped meat. He is practically family.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) OK. OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hammered meat here anyways, beef or pork has been charcoaled grill and pulverized in rope beef thread (ph) and then given a distinct texture and served with spicy chili in galongo (ph) dip.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: Oh, so, I guess that I have been accepted by the family, and I will be living in the house here next door, and my job is going to be to smash beef with the hammer every night, probably for the rest of my life.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: This woman has expectations, dude.\\n\\nRICKER: I am in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: It is pretty obvious. What if they didn't pound it before they cook?\\n\\nRICKER: It wouldn't look like that if they didn't pound it before they cooked it. The whole idea...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Classic. Mm. That's good.\\n\\nRICKER: Chewy. Hmm. Still chewy, and still chewing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And because Andy is a VIP and potential future son-in-law, dad is sporting his 40 amulets with protection, brings out the chef's special, a bitter soup with buffalo tendon (inaudible). That doesn't sound good. Oh, that is addictive right away.\\n\\nRICKER: Deep and dark basis and you are getting some of the heat?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah. You know, we talked about once you experience some of the sensory pleasures of the east, your previous life just isn't adequate anymore.\\n\\nWhen the journey is coming to an end, when the movie is over, what's left to do? Oh, yes, wrap things up. I think, we've learn something here today in Chiang Mai, I can't summon what it is might be right now, you know, I was thinking of what Muhammad just said, you know, don't tell me what a man knows on what he says, tell where he is trapped, you will learn stuff. Maybe it is to remember to bring something to remove makeup before hitting the cabarets.\\n\\nRICKER: Like, the first time I spent a long period of time in Thailand, that sort of greatness, the spiciness and the simple elements making kind of -- this bright explosion of flavors and when I got back home, I immediately like wished I could be back in Thailand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Or maybe just say screw it, and have a good time. It is quite beautiful. Thank you so much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nRICKER: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  It takes a special breed to live in a province like Quebec.  It gets cold in winter, and winters are long.  It takes a special kind of person for whom frozen rivers, icy wind-whipped streets, deep seemingly endless forests are the norm.\\n\\nI will confess my partisanship up front.  I love Montreal.  It is my favorite place in Canada.  The people who live there are tough, crazy bastards, and I admire them for it.  Toronto, Vancouver, I love you, but not like Montreal.  Why?  I shall explain.  All will be revealed.  In the meantime, check this guy out.\\n\\n(On camera):  What\\'s the Post Office\\'s motto?  Neither rain nor sleet nor driving snow nor plague of locusts prevent the mail carrier from delivering my junk mail?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Here in Montreal, the simple task of delivering the mail in winter comes with its own set of hurdles.  Icy hurdles.\\n\\n(On camera):  I got to ask, do you have special equipment for this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'ve got on, like, slip on boots.  We do have our boots in the rains -- sorry, when it gets icy with the spikes on them.  And they give us also slip on the spikes for when it\\'s icy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any sort of city ordinance that you have to shovel or -- they\\'re not penalized financially?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, nothing like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any injuries in the line of duty?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'ve had several, like, tumbles, one incident I was off for two months.  I thought I broke my ankle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is the most perilous aspect of the job?  Would it be dogs or icy stairs?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In this area there\\'s a lot of dogs, but I would say icy stairs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s one thing to have to work outside in this wintry mess, but it takes a strange and wonderful kind of mutant to actually find it pleasurable like, well, these two gentlemen.       (On camera):  Do you like the cold?  I mean, by you, I mean the\\n\\nQuebecoise.\\n\\nFRED MORIN, CO-OWNER, JOE BEEF:  It cleans the streets of (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The cold?\\n\\nMORIN:  Yes.\\n\\nDAVE MCMILLAN, CO-OWNER, JOE BEEF:  The frigid cold keeps the riffraff out of the city, for sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Fred Morin and Dave McMillan, restaurateur, chefs at the legendary Joe Beef, (speaking in foreign language), historians of their beloved great white north, princes of hospitality.\\n\\nAnd what do men like these do for fun when the rivers turned to ice three-feet thick, when testicles shrink and most of us scurry for warmth and shelter?  If they were like so many other Canadians, they would go ice fishing on the St. Lawrence River.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  The cabin fever induces in the Quebecoise family because we are confined perhaps to spend so much time indoors.  A lot of the families love to do, you know, activities together, like this, go to the cottage, goes ice fishing, you know, it gets you out of the house.  And it\\'s very much a family thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like many of their ilk, they seek one of the temporary small towns of sled-born cabins, drill a hole in the ice, and wait. But these are not normal men.\\n\\n(On camera):  So is Quebec better than the rest of Canada?\\n\\nMORIN:  Obviously.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, come on.  You can\\'t think about that long.\\n\\nMORIN:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now wait a minute.  Now are strippers paid hourly here?  Is that right?  It\\'s not a tip system?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s considered an art -- a performance art.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You consider it a performance art.  So how does that work?  You don\\'t --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  You pay for a song.  You pay for a song.  And then --       BOURDAIN:  You pay per song.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  And then you can get a dance in the back, which is a private dance.  And that\\'s 10 bucks a song, five bucks a song in public.\\n\\nMORIN:  That\\'s why I go to (INAUDIBLE) strip because the songs are super-long.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI\\'m a bit (INAUDIBLE).  You know, I go for the king shrimp and lap dance.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  After a suspiciously stunned-looking fish emerges from the deep, previously whoof (ph) and all by an eager producer no doubt, it is ignored, because Fred and Dave do things differently.  No crudely fried fish and bread crumbs for these large living 19th Century men.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow.  Holy shit.  Look at that.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Instead, a hearty lunch of French classics, accompanied by many fine wines and liqueurs, as befitting gentlemen of discerning taste who\\'ve exhausted themselves in the wild.\\n\\n(On camera):  So this is how you live?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Well, more often than not, yes.\\n\\nMORIN:  We always have to travel well and eat properly.  We\\'re taking a natural white wine, (INAUDIBLE), white burgundy.  These are Glaser bay oysters as well as a couple Boujelois thrown in there.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  They\\'re delicious in my prized possession those little --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  I mean, the funnest part about the restaurant business isn\\'t the cutlery.  It\\'s just the spoon is absolutely gorgeous.  You know, Fred has a wonderful collection of tableware.  Without getting, you know, snobby or elitist, you know, eating off vintage tableware is one of the great joys out of life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, this is the interesting paradox of you guys. You aspire to -- to run a democratic establishment, and yet you are hopeless romantics when it comes to --\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Painful nostalgics.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The art of living.  Right?  What the --       (Voice-over):  Sustenance is required.\\n\\n(On camera):  Holy -- look at this.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Like say a consomme of oxtail to begin.  Followed perhaps by a chilled lobster a la Parisian?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  The art of dining is kind of disappearing much to our chagrin.  I work super hard at being an excellent dining companion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  When seeking excellence in a dining companion, what qualities does one look for?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  I turn my phone off.  I -- you know, I never put my elbows on the table.  I don\\'t --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Of course.  Come prepared with stories.  Don\\'t drink too much, don\\'t become sloppy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come prepared with anecdotes?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No elbows on the table?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  No, it\\'s not -- it\\'s not proper.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m a total failure as a dining companion.  What is that?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  What\\'s that, you ask?  An iconic (INAUDIBLE) era classic of gastronomy?\\n\\n(On camera):  Look at that sauce.  Holy crap.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The devilishly difficult (INAUDIBLE) ala Royale, a boneless wild hair, in a sauce of its own blood, a generous heaping of fresh black truffle, garnished with thick slabs of foie gras, seared directly on the top of the cabin\\'s wood stove.\\n\\n(On camera):  Damn, look at that.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  We\\'re in a wooden shack, over three feet of ice, and 100 feet of water.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You are hopeless, hopeless romantics, gentlemen.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that.  Oh.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The seared foie is perched atop in ethereal suspension of Joe (INAUDIBLE) inspired potato puree.  Of course.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  This is (INAUDIBLE) from (INAUDIBLE) Vineyard by Teddy (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Nice.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  That\\'s wonderful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, yes, it is.  Really, is there a -- is there billionaire or a despot anywhere out on Earth who at this precise moment is eating better than us?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  Look at that.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  (Speaking in foreign language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Cheese.  There must be cheese.  In this case, a voluptuously reeking Epoisses, who some less hardy outdoors might call overripe, but not us.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is awesome.  What do we have here?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  A few Cuban.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wait a minute, you guys have a much more relaxed attitude towards the importation of Cuban cigars.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Chartreuse, of course, and a desert as rare as it gets, a dinosaur era monster long believed extinct.\\n\\nMORIN:  This is Gateau Marjolaine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Who does this?\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s one of those, like, painful nostalgic things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Layers of almond and hazelnut meringue, chocolate butter cream.\\n\\n(On camera):  My god, look at that.  Damn, that\\'s good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  For these guys, this is normal.  This is lunch.\\n\\nMORIN:  Some days it\\'s like playhouse in my house, it\\'s French playhouse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes, what do you do?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  They get dressed at their house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No way.  Tell me all about it.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  The kids, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He\\'s a dandy.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  He\\'s a dandy.       MORIN:  A Sunday dandy.  Last time I did, I did (INAUDIBLE),\\n\\nprimrose and the Linzer Torte, I made (INAUDIBLE) caramel, I made salad a la orange.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMORIN:  I made (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMORIN:  With a creme fraiche, and then a huge cheese curd that was about like 15 kinds of cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  And how many people are in your family at this meal?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Him and his wife, and two young boys.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And how old are the kids?\\n\\nMORIN:  Two and 4.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you, your wife and a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old.\\n\\nMORIN:  They don\\'t make it to the end, usually, after like -- I have to like prematurely open --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  They don\\'t like (INAUDIBLE)?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And I\\'m thinking this, and I\\'m think, well, that\\'s really tough, but I\\'m also thinking, you know, I\\'ve got to do that.  I want to do that.  And actually my daughter would totally be into it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Once every few decades, maybe every century, a nation will produce a hero.  An Escoffiere, a Muhammad Ali, a Dalai Lama, a Joey Marrone, someone who changes everything about their chosen field, who changes the whole landscape.  Life after them is never the same.\\n\\nMartin Picard is such a man.  A here-to-for, an encounter hybrid of rugged outdoorsman, veteran chef, with many years of fine dining experience.  Renegade, innovator, he is one of the most influential chefs in North America.  He is also a proud Quebecois, and perhaps he more than everyone else has defined for a new generation of Americans and Canadians what that means.\\n\\nHe\\'s an unlikely ambassador for his country and his province. Maybe not so unlikely.  I mean, look at him.  Out for a day, trapping beaver with local trapper Carl.\\n\\n(On camera):  So the bait is wood?\\n\\nMARTIN PICARD, CHEF:  Yes, just the bark.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They eat the bark?\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes, yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I understand in pioneer days, beaver was the financial engine of Canada?\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Empires were built on it.  Every hat practically in the world was made of a beaver pelt.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s why today it\\'s the icon of Canada.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  To a lesser extent, the tradition continues today.  Carl continues to trap, usually called on by provincial officials to trap beaver and clear away dams and control what could become an destructively over populated situation.\\n\\n(On camera):  Hello, my little friend.\\n\\nPICARD:  This is a young one.  And those are the ones we want to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What would you compare the meat to?  Is there anything like it.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s the thing, you know, there\\'s nothing like it. You know, when you eat beaver, you understand that it\\'s beaver.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Martin, along with an encyclopedic knowledge of fine wines and an attachment to the music of Celine Dion, is a big believer in honoring history and tradition.  If you still trap beavers, you should, if at all possible, cook them and eat them, not just strip them of their pelts.  And as incredible as it might seem, you can cook beaver really, really well.\\n\\nBeaver tail, on the other hand, is not actually beaver at all, rather a quick spoonbread type of thing that in our case goes somewhat awry during an inadvertent inferno.\\n\\n(On camera):  The sauce, it almost looks like chocolate.  So rich looking, huh?\\n\\nPICARD:  I love it.  When it\\'s like this.  Some people don\\'t put too much blood, but I like when it\\'s very thick.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  It\\'s absolutely delicious.\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes, it is.  I wasn\\'t joking about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It tastes like chicken.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNo, it doesn\\'t take like chicken at all.\\n\\nPICARD:  This is your first time?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nPICARD:  Wow.  That\\'s something.  I think you almost eat everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, at this point, you know animals, they see me and they\\'re like oh --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPICARD:  No, no.  Not him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Not that guy.\\n\\n(On camera):  There\\'s a joke around here somewhere, but to tell you the truth, the stuff is just too good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  It\\'s like 10 below zero in this freaking town. And that generally does not spell good time for me.  A good time for me is more like a palm tree, a beach, a swimming pool, with only cold thing is my beer.  But no.  These hearty culinarians of the north like to frolic in the snow and ice.  More accurately they like to obey their genetic Quebecois imperative to risk dental and maxillofacial injury, by skating around, slapping at a hard disk, trying to drive it in each other\\'s general direction.\\n\\nI believe they call this sport hockey.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is not in my blood.  Do you skate?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes, we grew up on rinks like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Does everyone in Quebec, it\\'s pretty much obligatory?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s your stick, kid.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  What else can you do?  There\\'s no reason to live here if there\\'s no hockey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Hockey rinks pop up all over the city to accommodate Montreal\\'s desire to risk teeth, groin and limb.  And right behind Fred and Dave\\'s restaurant Joe Beef, a pickup game of chefs, cooks and hospitality professionals is under way.\\n\\n(On camera):  Some of these guys have put (INAUDIBLE) a little long and a tooth to be out there, swinging sticks at each other and skidding around in the ice.  This is normal behavior.  People actually do this for fun?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  This is every day Quebecois, growing up, playing hockey.  Canadian national sport, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  And this young one is already being indoctrinated.  Hello, young man.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  You want to play?  Are you good at hockey?  Are you going to be a goalie or a player?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A player.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  A player.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Am I going to get, like, a mouth full of puck, by the way?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Being catered with Fred and Dave\\'s usual restraint.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Come eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hot coco in Styrofoam cups?  No, try a titanic Chucrute Garni ala (INAUDIBLE), containing Flintstone-sized hunks of pork belly, (INAUDIBLE), bacon, homemade Boudin Blanc, kielbasa, smoked chops, plus veal and pork links.\\n\\n(On camera):  Oh, yes, this is a truly heroic Chucrute.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Look at that beautiful work of linking (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This dish is the single best argument for sharing a border with Germany.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And, of course, the finest wines known to humanity.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  German wine, Silvaner, in pirate bottles.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Sweet.  What am I drinking here?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Canadian Riesling.  This is Norman Hardie Riesling from Prince Albert County five hours from here.  Amazing wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s an allegory here somewhere.  I\\'m reaching for it.  Something about Fred and Dave\\'s reckless abandon, coupled with precision and technique.  A hockey metaphor, perhaps. The hell with it.  Look, sausages.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Montreal to Quebec City by rail.  160 miles of wintry vistas, whip past the windows, evocative for some of another time.       MORIN:  The Canadian caviar, Sturgeon Canadian caviar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not sure about Dave McMillan, but in Fred Morin\\'s perfect world, we would all travel by rail.  It would still be the golden age of rail travel.\\n\\n(On camera): So tell me about the great Canadian rail system.\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s purely emotional.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMORIN:  There\\'s nothing rational about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Fred is what one might call conservatively an aficionado.\\n\\n(On camera):  So how extreme is your railroad nerdism?\\n\\nMORIN:  This is how bad it gets.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  You have other operating manuals?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of this model train.\\n\\nMORIN:  Yes.  The model.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you have other operating manuals?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Books, printed ephemera, collectibles.  Fred retains an enduring love for the great iron horses that still take passengers across the frozen land he calls home.  But it\\'s something more than just nostalgia.  It\\'s also an appreciation for a dying art.\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s like the old cruise ships.  You transport your comfort, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For those halcyon days of cross-country rail, there were lavish dining cars, luxurious sleeping compartments, a bar car with liveried attendants.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Look at the menus, how people used to eat on the trains.  It\\'s also an inspiration on how we cook in the restaurant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Casserole and sweet breads and fresh peas with Veronese sauce.  Leg of lamb (INAUDIBLE) jelly.\\n\\nMORIN:  Some very nice pictures in the dining by train book, with the guy holding the turkey and cutting the turkey.  And you order a drink, it comes from a bottle made out of glass, into a glass made out of glass.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMORIN:  Which is kind of cool in our day and age.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It goes back to service, doesn\\'t it?  Thank you.\\n\\n(Voice-over): We are presented with a perfectly serviceable omelet.  There may no longer be a smoking lounge with brass pitons, but this does not mean a traveler has to suffer.\\n\\n(On camera):  So you always travel with a truffle shaver?\\n\\nMORIN:  During truffle season.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As a gentleman must.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  I\\'ve got to get a inaction photograph.  Hold on.  Canadian rail.  People are going to be expecting, wait a minute, where is my fist-sized truffle?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Can I get the truffle option, please?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, of course.  Don\\'t forget the foie.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Quebec City, one of the oldest European settlements in North America.  Samuel de Champlain, known as the father of New France, sailed up the St. Lawrence and founded the site in 1608.  When the fighting started with you know who, Quebec City was the French stronghold until the bitter end when the French fell at the plains of Abraham.\\n\\nThe French may have lost that one, but some things French have stayed firm, unbowed, resiliently unchanged by trends or history.\\n\\nThe Continental is the kind of place about which I am unreservedly sentimental.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  When I was younger, I ate here with my grandparents and my parents, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, that\\'s older restaurant in town.  It\\'s open since 1956.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Classic, unironic, cuisine (INAUDIBLE), meaning dishes you haven\\'t seen since like forever.  A hipster-free zone of French, continental, ocean liner classics such as Caesar salad, tossed fresh to (INAUDIBLE) tableside and beef tartare, also prepared tableside as one must.\\n\\nShrimp cocktail, not a deconstructed shrimp cocktail mind you, a shrimp cocktail, the way Jesus wants you to eat them.  All served by a dedicated professional.\\n\\n(On camera):  In culinary school we were taught this.  I mean, real customers as your final class.  We had to do the (INAUDIBLE) of fruits, tableside, all of that, which inevitably would fly off the fork or land (INAUDIBLE) soup.  I was so bad at it.  I would run into trouble and I would be like, I\\'ll be right back, behind the scene.  I bite with my teeth.  Stripping the thing.  At least once a day one of the students would set themselves or the customers on fire.       The bather would, like, spill, and they\\'d light, there\\'d be this\\n\\nline from, like, the thing down up across the floor up their leg.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  No, that shit doesn\\'t happen here.  Like I said, professionals.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is going to go like a big fireball.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Fireball.  Good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The kind who know how to properly prepare these dishes.\\n\\n(On camera):  Sweet.\\n\\nMORIN:  Like a goose bump moment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  For Dave, another classic, filet de boeuf en (INAUDIBLE).  A filet mignon, a sauce made of cognac, cream and glass (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(On camera):  That is nice.  Look at that.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And for Fred, scampi Newburgh.  When is the last time you saw the word \"Newburgh\" on a menu?\\n\\n(On camera):  Awesome, absolutely awesome.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  But for me, that most noble of dishes, Dover sole. This appears to be one of the few remaining servers alive who knows how to take that fish off the bone, sauce it, and properly serve it.\\n\\n(On camera):  Thank you very much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bon appetit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Merci.  Man, I love this place.  I\\'m so happy.  It\\'s very comfortable.  There\\'s continuity in this world.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Across town, another thing entirely.  The younger, wilder L\\'affaire est Ketchup, which I\\'m reliably informed means everything is cool in local idiom.\\n\\nAt this point in my life, I just don\\'t know anymore.  Are these young cooks, these servers, these dedicated entrepreneurs, are these hipsters?  Or am I just a cranky old who think anybody below the age of 30 is a hipster?  I don\\'t know, but I admire them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So how much did it cost you when you opened?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look at this tiny electric four-burner stove.  At no point in my cooking career could I have worked with one of these without murdering everyone in the vicinity before hanging myself from the nearest beam.\\n\\n(On camera):  How long did it take to adapt?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say like three months.  At the beginning, I was lucky that I didn\\'t have, like, a lot of customers. It was like, oh, man.  I was freaking out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And yet these kids today, look at them go, serving a wildly ambitious and quite substantial ever-changing menu out of this -- this Suzy homemaker oven.  Tonight there\\'s razor clams with burned (INAUDIBLE), and a cream of haddock roe.\\n\\n(On camera):  Very cool.  Thank you.  I love razor clams.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And coquille St. Jacques.  You\\'ll notice that nobody in Quebec seems to skimp on the portions.  A (INAUDIBLE) of foie gras, head cheese with (INAUDIBLE) mustard, and Ris de veau truffe, that\\'s truffled sweetbreads, and you got some goose hearts (INAUDIBLE) for good measure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now the goose heart is excellent.  Goose heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Hearts in general.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Also you got your morue salee with grilled tomato bread.  That\\'s salt cod for you, Anglos.\\n\\nI\\'m all swollen up, like the (INAUDIBLE), and ready to burst in a livery omni-directional mist.  Hotel motel time for me.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  How Canadian is Quebec?  Are they truly one entity or two?  This is a question that has been wrestled with for some time.  Quebec is certainly part of Canada, but in many ways both culturally, spiritually and linguistically, it\\'s very much another thing entirely.  There\\'s a lot of history, much of it contentious.  Go back far enough and you get a clearer picture of why.\\n\\nThe French arrived on the shores of Quebec City in the early 16th century that succumbed to the military might of Great Britain in the mid-18th.  Thus began a gradual but steady persecution of all things French.  The Quebecois had struggled mightily to hang on to their French heritage and language.  The issue of seceding entirely a notion that persists to some extent even today.\\n\\nJournalist Patrick Lagace meets me at Bistro M Sur Masson to help me understand a little bit of what many Quebecois feel is at stake.\\n\\n(On camera):  So I was going to talk about the whole history of French Quebecois identify.  A separatist movement, but I have to get right to the pressing matter of the day, pasta-gate.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPATRICK LAGACE, JOURNALIST:  Pasta- gate.  What do you want to know about pasta-gate?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  For those not up on current Quebec politics, pasta-gate refers to an incident where local authorities notified an Italian restaurant that they were in violation of French laws because they used the word \"pasta\" which is Italian.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is --\\n\\nLAGACE:  OK.  Stop apologizing, OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Don\\'t get me wrong.  My last name is Bourdain.  I lean French.  Hard.\\n\\n(On camera):  I am enormously sympathetic to the language laws.\\n\\nLAGACE:  You don\\'t think it\\'s preposterous?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do not think it\\'s preposterous.  But here we have a situation.\\n\\nLAGACE:  It is stupid.  I agree with you completely that this province 40 years ago was in some respects an English city, so we needed to have language laws for signage and stuff.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Now signage, for instance, must by law be principally in French.  French first in all things.\\n\\nLAGACE:  But ever bureaucracy produces byproducts of stupidity, and that was it.  And you know what?  It will not stand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Anglo Canadians treated French-speaking Quebecois like second-class crap for much of history.  So I get it.  I\\'d be pissed, too.  I want my own thing and when I got it, I\\'d wake to make sure there\\'s no backsliding to the bad old days.\\n\\nLAGACE:  When the (INAUDIBLE) Quebecois, the first sovereignist party to be elected, it was in 1976, it didn\\'t come out of a vacuum. It came out from a couple of decades of awakening and struggle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Fifty years from now, will people still speak in --\\n\\nLAGACE:  French.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- predominantly French in Montreal?\\n\\nLAGACE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No doubt about it.\\n\\nLAGACE:  No doubt about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  French first is something most would agree with.  How far and how rigorously you want to go with that? Well --       (On camera):  Do you think there was ever any possibility or real\\n\\nmajority or plurality of Quebecois who would have voted in separate nation status?\\n\\nLAGACE:  You know, in English, you guys say timing is everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nLAGACE:  And timing was never better than in the period 1990, \\'91, \\'92, because in \\'95 this country came inches from being broken up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Close.  Yes.  And do you think it will ever happen in the history of the world?\\n\\nLAGACE:  I don\\'t know, but I know one thing.  Anybody who says separatism is dead in this country and this province is a fool.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  No matter how you feel about Quebec as either separate from or as an essentially part of greater Canada, any reasonable person loves this place.\\n\\n(On camera):  Correct me if I\\'m wrong, Wilensky\\'s is famous for the sandwich?  The special.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wilensky special.  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And it was tradition does this fall?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s basically Eastern Europe.  It was a survival thing.  It was because they were poor.  And that\\'s what they could make.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Wilensky\\'s, an old-school corner institution around since 1932, serving up pressed beef baloney and salami sandwiches, or specials as they call them, along with egg creams and milkshakes.\\n\\n(On camera):  So the special and an appropriate beverage and egg cream?  Very happy.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Here\\'s how it goes.  There are rules.  The special is always served with mustard.  It is never cut in two.  Don\\'t ask why, just because.  That\\'s the way it\\'s always been done.  A little respect for tradition, please.\\n\\n(On camera):  I\\'m happy now.  You know?  Some things are beloved institutions for a reason.  This is delicious.  Thank you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The tradition of the cabane a sucre or sugar shack is as old as maple syrup here in Quebec, where 70 percent of the world\\'s supply comes from.  Deeply embedded in the maple syrup outdoor lumberjack lifestyle is the cabin in the woods, where maple sap is collected and boiled down to syrup.       Over time, many of these cabins became informal eating houses,\\n\\ndining halls for workers and a few guests, where a lucky few could sit at communal tables and enjoy the bounty of the trees and forests around them.\\n\\nMartin Picard has taken this tradition to what is somehow both its logical conclusion and insane extreme, creating his own cabane a sucre open only during maple season and serving food stemming directly from those humble yet hearty roots.  It makes perfect sense in one way, I mean, 130 acres produce about 32,000 gallons of maple sap, which run through these tubes to here where they\\'re cooked down to about 800 gallons of syrup, which is more or less what they use per season here.\\n\\nNothing leaves the proper.  And it makes sense, while you\\'re here to raise hogs, and cattle on the property.  And maybe keep a cabin or two around for any friends who get too loaded to sleep it off.  But this?  This?  Is there really any reason for this?\\n\\n(On camera):  What are you doing here?  Why do you have to make life so hard?  If money were your primary motivation --\\n\\nPICARD:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This doesn\\'t seem like the fasters road to untold wealth.\\n\\nPICARD:  My grandfather, you know, had a sugar shack.  Everybody had a -- you can go back, you know, three generations, they had a sugar shack.  And I\\'m very proud of Quebec.  I\\'m very proud of Canada, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You celebrate Canadian history, you celebrate Canadian traditions, you celebrate Canadian ingredients in a way that no one else has.  Are you some kind of patriot?  Is that what\\'s going on here?  Is it national Quebecois fervor?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  That\\'s very much it.  He\\'s very much a patriot.  I say it all the time, it\\'s one of the most important restaurants to me, in North America if not the world.  It\\'s an art installation if you actually -- if you look at it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The meal begins -- begins with a tower of maple desserts.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good lord.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Sponge maple toffee, maple doughnuts, beaver tails, maple cotton candy, but wait, there\\'s more.  Almond croissants, whip-it biscuits, some nougat.\\n\\n(On camera):  There we go.  I think that\\'s a first for me.  I\\'ve never seen that done.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  No?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not with a hammer.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Let the madness begin.  Next, a whole lobe of foie gras with baked beans on a pancake cooked in duck fat, of course, cottage cheese and eggs cooked in maple syrup.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow, that\\'s awesome.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  There\\'s a healthy salad, sauteed duck hearts, gizzards, and pig\\'s ear, topped with a heaping pile of fried pork rines.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good lord.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And a calf brain and maple bacon omelet.  And these.\\n\\n(On camera):  How is this made?\\n\\nPICARD:  With love.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With love.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Panko (ph) encrusted duck drumsticks with shrimp and salmon mouse and maple barbecue sauce.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good lord.  Wow.\\n\\nPICARD:  So this is a classic Quebecer dish, it\\'s called la tourtiere, you know, a meat pie.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tourtiere de Shack, a whole lot of cheese, foie gras, calf brain, sweetbreads, bacon and arugula, but with Martin, that\\'s not sufficient.\\n\\nPICARD:  Usually there\\'s no truffle, but I just.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, black truffles.\\n\\n(On camera):  More truffle.\\n\\nPICARD:  There\\'s going to be too much truffle.\\n\\nMORIN:  My blood is getting thicker as I look that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And now the main course, a homegrown smoked right out front local ham with pineapple and green beans almondine.  And chicken, but with Martin the chicken is never just chicken.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s (INAUDIBLE), with foie gras and lobster.  We pump lobster bisque in the chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  In the chicken.\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes.       BOURDAIN:  Good god.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  There is a light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\n(On camera):  Someone should be singing the national anthem now, I mean really.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And practically prehistoric old school Canadian classic.  Maple syrup is heated, then poured on snow, becoming a kind of taffy, but the preferred delivery mechanism does present some issues.\\n\\nPICARD:  No, no, no, no.  Take a big one, and you have to suck it.  Don\\'t swallow it, you know.  Look, you have to go like that, slowly, slowly, no?  Slowly, slowly.  That\\'s how it\\'s good.  That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Got to do that in a manly way?  You just don\\'t look down.  You sort of look away, a distracted way.  It\\'s like I\\'m not really (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  The best way is to look up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Finally there\\'s maple meringue cake and maple ice cream with chocolate shards.\\n\\n(On camera):  Any suggestion on how to attack this?\\n\\nMORIN:  We did it once.  I won the check (INAUDIBLE) for the ice cream cone.  Chefs suggest that eat the ice cream like that.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s the thing.  I think there\\'s too much focusing on the food.  You know?  Like, wow, this is very intellectual and I wow, and then blah, blah, and have done too much all those shit, you know? I don\\'t want to do that.  I don\\'t want to play game anymore.\\n\\nMORIN:  Because food is feces in waiting.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is CNN.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If there\\'s one thing you always need on a cold snowy night, it\\'s yet another hearty meal.  I meet back up with Fred and Dave in Liverpool House, the sister restaurant to Joe Beef.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  I think we always compensate a little bit with overabundance of food because of our insecurity of not being like good cooks.\\n\\nMORIN:  You know, you know what, it\\'s a combination of low self- esteem and generosity that explains the amount of food perhaps.       BOURDAIN:  First course.  Look at that.  Unbelievable.  Look at\\n\\nthe aspic work.\\n\\nMORIN:  This is smoked veal and potatoes inside.  Salmon pastrami.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But wait a minute, this is super classic.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And this.  Egg and aspic, soft boiled or poached egg in clear gelatin set broth classically garnished with white ham, tarragon leaves and black truffles.\\n\\n(On camera):  Oh, my gosh.  I was pretty sure that I would live the rest of my life without ever seeing this again.  Delicious.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  But tonight after a full week of Franco-Canadian full on assaults on our livers and our lights, Fred and Dave\\'s sauce would be both delicious and merciful to take advantage of the somewhat lighter and insanely delicious fare by their brilliant chef Omar, who\\'s from Pakistan.  Amazing authentic Pakistani food.\\n\\n(On camera):  So what do we have here?\\n\\nMORIN:  Butter chicken crab, octopus (INAUDIBLE), little eggplant grazed with (INAUDIBLE), pomegranate, a little mushrooms, rabbit (INAUDIBLE), fingerlings with (INAUDIBLE) fennel.  This is donkey in a hurry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Yes.  He did say donkey meat.  Is there something wrong with that?  The dishes continue, a Pakistani gumbo with okra and coriander, and sesame seed and green pepper curry, hanger state (INAUDIBLE).  All beef scotched egg, a pouri (ph) with horse meat tartar and an authentic goat (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow.\\n\\nMORIN:  Are you full?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  Food for 12.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We did good work here.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  In the end, but perhaps as a nod to the Anglo tradition however there will be stilt.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is a genius meal.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  These princes of gastronomy never a suboptimal moment, nothing short of excellent accepted.  Beyond excellent.  Too much excellent, yes, possibly.  Over the top?  Yes, definitely.\\n\\nIt all comes around in the end, the circle of life.  We begin at the beginning.  The heart and soul of every right-thinking Quebecois apparently.\\n\\nIce, a stick and a puck.  Fred and Dave and Martin Picard are joined by the original god of Montreal gastronomy, the great chef, Normand Laprise, to watch their beloved Montreal Canadians lay waste to the Carolina Hurricanes.  All the while eating, of course, and drinking as it turns out the finest wines known to humanity.\\n\\n(On camera):  Yes.  Here we go.  Whoa.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(THEME SONG)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, PARTS UNKNOWN HOST (voice-over):  Nearly a year on the road, all those miles, all those airports, infinite variety of awful plumbing, it was time for something low impact.  So, off to Jamaica.\\n\\n(on camera): This is the first time I\\'ve ever driven a car on the wrong side of the road, I mean knowingly.  How hard could it be?  Oh I get to pass on the right, too.\\n\\nThankfully, we have a roll bar.\\n\\n(voice-over): But this time a different angle, you probably know of Jamaica as a vacation paradise, but it\\'s worth mentioning this is a divided country and it is has been in one form or another since the days of slavery.  There\\'s a small minority who control most everything and then there\\'s the poorer, generally darker skin majority less connected, left out.\\n\\nJamaican cuisine, a lot of it, still reflects this conflicted story. Breadfruit, salt fish, this was slave food.  Cheap, long-lasting, filling introduced basically as feed.\\n\\n(on -camera) Day one, first order of business, get my, you know, some jerk chicken.\\n\\nCan you blame me?  No.  I think not.  Oh that was good.  Yeah, yeah, I know this routine, believe me.  It\\'s brown.  It\\'s murky and it burns money (ph).  It burns.\\n\\n(voice-over): And there are still all these years later, two Jamaicans.\\n\\nThere\\'s the Jamaica that most Jamaicans live in, cook in, struggled to survive in, the real Jamaica.  Then there\\'s the Jamaica which you\\'re probably more familiar with.\\n\\nThe tourists have been coming to Jamaica for a long time, when this part of the island, particularly, Port Antonio, threatened to become an international jet set destination.\\n\\nLocal legend has it that Errol Flynn was shipwrecked here on his yacht in 1947 and promptly fell in love with the place.  Before Flynn, it has been an empire of bananas.  A huge industry that later become United Fruit.  Bananas went out, tourist came in.  The banana business eventually went elsewhere and when tourism shifted to the other side of the island with the construction of an airport at Montego Bay, well, that was pretty much it.  The northeast coast was largely forgotten.\\n\\nIt has the feel still of a forgotten paradise.  There are those who believed that the area can come back and it must come back, that the future is in hotels and resorts and restaurants for wealthy visitors as it once was.\\n\\nTake this place, for instance.  The Trident Hotel, expensive, luxurious, best of all, I\\'m the only guest.\\n\\nOh, did I mention it comes with a castle?  What kind of person would own a building like that?  Who?  Why?\\n\\nThen this man arrived and kind of answered that question.  All of this belongs to Michael Lee-Chin, local boy turned billionaire, one of the richest men in the world and my host.  He\\'s invited me for dinner.\\n\\nMICHAEL LEE-CHIN, OWNER OF TRIDENT HOTEL:  We\\'ll try some rum before we do some crabbing, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  You\\'re right.  Yeah, that\\'s sounds like a plan.\\n\\n(voice-over): But first we need crabs for that dinner I\\'m told, caught in a traditional style.  A drink is in order.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right, cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let\\'s start crabbing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Crabbing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of crab holes.\\n\\nThis time of year, Port Antonio was literally crawling with crabs.  I am told it will be really easy.  Just scoop up the little bastards and then it\\'s back to the pool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tony, you haven\\'t seen any, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  No, I\\'m looking, I\\'ll launch at them.  It\\'s hot.  I think is that rum.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'ve got to take in the bush, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s sweltering, freaking hot, and dark.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You finding something?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Awesome, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  But it doesn\\'t seem to bother the hotel chefs who willing risk dismemberment for the sake of procuring a tasty dinner.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We want them alive.  We have questions to ask them.  Where are your friends?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yeah.\\n\\n(voice-over): One crab down, 49 left to go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re down by 20, we\\'ve got to get some more tonight.  So...\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I\\'m, frankly, anxious to get this over with so when the opportunity rises to stick my paw down into a hole where there\\'s probably a pissed-off crab, looking to clamp down my pinky with his pincers, I could careless.\\n\\n(on camera): Nothing.  Nope, nobody home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Damn it.  I think I step on an ant nest.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Are those fire ants?  Wonderful.  Please attack my nutsack.  Anything to get this over with quicker.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He\\'s running...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you all right, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Good.  And I don\\'t want to kill the little guy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s it right there.  Right on the left, right on the left, woah.  Expert.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nice one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Next.\\n\\n(voice-over): But seems like several sweltering hours later, it\\'s mission accomplished and it is back to home base and time to get ready for dinner at the castle, followed by a party, I\\'m told.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you recognize this, Tony?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I put this guy in a bag tonight.\\n\\n(voice-over): I\\'m joined by billionaire Michael, his partner John Baker, music producer and hotelier, John\\'s wife Nordia, Errol Flynn\\'s grandson, Luke Flynn and his wife Sky.\\n\\n(on-camera): You grew up in this...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... in this area.  What was Port Antonio like in the \\'50s?\\n\\nLEE-CHIN:  Port Antonio was -- it was vibrant, banana, lots of wealthy tourist.  So Port Antonio was a happening place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You are a man with a diverse financial interest, banks, communications.  As a veteran of 30 years in the hospitality business, why?  Why would you do such a hard and probably unprofitable thing?  I mean, usually unprofitable.\\n\\nLEE-CHIN:  You\\'re being very kind.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a really...\\n\\nLEE-CHIN:  Well, I thought you\\'re smart and that you\\'re brilliant but you behavior shows that you don\\'t.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, no.  I know the answer.  Are you a romantic?\\n\\nLEE-CHIN:  Great thing can and will happen when you romanticize, you dream, you aspire, you see a vision and you settle to achieve that vision.  Trident is here to catalyze people to come to Port Antonio and discover wow, wow, and wow again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where does it cross over where all of the things you love about this area, where all of the villas are spanking new and people are building 400 room hotels?  Is there a threshold for things start to not be -- the things that you loved about the place in the first place?  And how do you guard against that?\\n\\nLEE-CHIN:  You know, Tony, Port Antonio is a long way from getting there.  It has not progressed out of the \\'50s.  It\\'s had very little tourism in recent years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why is there a lots of -- everybody loves reggae, everybody loves Bob Marley, everybody loves spicy, delicious Jamaican food. What is the problem?\\n\\nLEE-CHIN:  Because you don\\'t get off a plane and go 100 yards to an all-inclusive.  There is no rural lift here.  You have to get here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That simple.  There is no....\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s as simples as a lift and it is as simple as -- we\\'re shrouded by the Blue Mountains and it\\'s an effort to get here.  So it filters out certain forms of travelers.  So we have to make it a little bit easier to get...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beat (ph) out by a lot of lame islands these days?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, totally.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And even in Jamaica, lamer areas for me, I say if someone says I\\'ve been to Jamaica and they haven\\'t been to Port Antonio, I\\'m like, \"Really?  You didn\\'t get a real feeling of Jamaica.\" LEE-CHIN:  You can\\'t go many places in the world and find natural beauty, people who are genuinely warm where there\\'s a strong culture, food, strong culture, in terms of music.  And at the same time, being able to be a part of a community and you can be a visitor without being a part of a tourist industry.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Hello.\\n\\n(voice-over): During World War II, British Naval Intelligence Officer Ian Fleming came to Jamaica on a secret mission to investigate possible U-Boat activities.  Like the legendary character he would later create, he was a spy.  The mission came to nothing and Fleming fell immediately in love with the island and vowed to return, which he did, buying this place, Goldeneye.\\n\\nAt the time considered, very Spartan (ph), a cottage, a single room really, a few smaller rooms in the back but an incredible view.  He spent much of the rest of his life here writing a book each year at this desk.  You know those books.\\n\\nToday, Fleming\\'s cottage has been enlarged and made more luxurious as a hotel but the original house still stands along with some improvements.\\n\\nBravo, aye?\\n\\n(on camera): What did every young American boy want?  Every red- blooded American male born in 1956, I could tell you, they wanted a grotto.\\n\\nIt sounds a pretty good to be a 12.  As I got older, I started to think about this.  It was like exactly who was in that grotto before me, it becomes more of a concern as you grow up.  It\\'s like did Ron Jeremy (ph) just leave the grotto?  Am I the first one in the grotto? Did someone change the water in the grotto?  These were concerns later in life, but this was it.  I wanted a grotto.  I still kind of do.\\n\\nThank you so much.  This is totally better than the Playboy mansion. You know that the Playboy mansion totally smells like old man hero (ph) stink.\\n\\n(voice-over): The current owner of Goldeneye is another unusual man, Chris Blackwell, legendary music producer, turned hotelier.  Over the years, Blackwell has expanded the property into a resort.  Its gates reaching right up to the fishing beach at neighboring Oracabessa. Blackwell has big plans for the area.\\n\\nThe next day, I leave GoldenEye\\'s luxurious embrace headed into town for something, well, I just I had to have, a long time favorite.\\n\\n(on-camera):  What do we have here?  Ox tail.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Yeah, man.  Curry goat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sweet.\\n\\n(voice-over): I don\\'t care whether it\\'s the Bronx or Kingston or wherever I can get it.  Ox tail, curried goat, (inaudible) and, of course rice and pigeon peas, got to have that.\\n\\n(on camera): God, I love the food in this country.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, man.  The best.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s such a mix.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Asian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  African.  A lot of - people totally miss that.  I mean curry goat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, man.  It\\'s...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It comes from the East Indies, what they use to call it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And that\\'s true.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Chef Precis\\' (ph) cook shop has become something of a local institution, a thriving business in a town that seen better days.\\n\\n(on camera): How long you\\'ve been up in here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'ve been up in this little shop for 13 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  13 years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The town changed in that time or stayed the same?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well right now, you know, we are in -- our economy\\'s not been so good right now so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not?  It\\'s one of the most areas in the world.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, for real.  We have a beautiful water front.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful weather.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, beautiful ladies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fantastic food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, what more could a guy ask for?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think went wrong?  I mean why would people stop coming?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I guess the guys in the top seat mess it up, so they are trying to correct it now, you know. BOURDAIN:  It\\'s expanding fast.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The town.  And then they\\'re going to be building all the way...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, all the way down there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All the way around.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, so...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So that\\'s thousands of tourists?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, thousands probably.  To be honest, I\\'m waiting for that moment.  I don\\'t want to...\\n\\nWe really need that, you know, because this town was dying fast, and real fast.  So it\\'s about, now, coming back and it\\'s now booming his town.  So, it\\'s a good step in the right direction.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  See now -- now I\\'m happy.  That is just beautiful.  Nice place to grow up?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s the life being a kid?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My childhood days I use to spend it on a beach.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s pretty good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who gets to do that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well I guess me and my friends.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean do you ever take it for granted?  Like you ever said -- do you ever get...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we do.  We do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You do?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.  We do.  See, and the thing about it when we really need it, that\\'s the time we cant have it, you know?  Because a lot of our water fronts have been gone, you know, we have very little right now.  You know, it\\'s OK, we have Kingston Beach like a 10 minutes walk from the house and so, at least we were one of the lucky ones.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s inevitable of course, that next door to GoldenEye there would be a James Bond beach.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All of the Bond movies were conceptualized and written here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When Blackwell heard I wanted to visit the local fisherman, he hooked me up with his good friend, Carl, to accompany me.\\n\\nI\\'m here to hit Dr. Hoe\\'s (ph), a local rum bar where one can indulge in a typical hard working fisherman\\'s breakfast, rum.\\n\\n(on-camera): So we\\'re drinking rum here?  We\\'re drinking beer?  Or are we drinking rum and beer?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All I know, it\\'s hardcore.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But you\\'re recommending just like some beer and some rum together.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right, Steel Bottom now, right?  Then the one part of rum.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One, yup.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And four parts of beer.  No water, no ice.  Try that.  The Steel Bottom, meaning it\\'s none.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  And you could take it in your dimension.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So who fishes here?  Do you fish?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are you fishing for?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hold on, let me get it.  It\\'s multiple fishing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This will be your snapper, your pirate, your grunt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  So is business better these days or worse these days?  OK, worse, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Over fishing is a problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Oracabessa is fishing village, for now at least.  All throughout the Caribbean, fish stocks are in decline and making a living from the sea is getting harder and harder. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So right here, it actually become a fishing sanctuary where we\\'re trying to now revive the fish stock around the island.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if this becomes a protected sanctuary, what are you going to do for a living?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, so they have to go farther out to sea for deep sea fishing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That means more gas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  More gas, more economic (inaudible) less fish.  So it\\'s a stream, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there a future for the traditional fishing industry in Jamaica or do you think like every place else in the Caribbean, is it going to end up an entirely tourist economy?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s going to be like that in two ways.  This place because I think things on the island does -- love the spot which is in a cove just like Chris Blackwell.  And he will tell me that I cannot fish in there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well what is happening now...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And here\\'s what I\\'m kind of getting at, rich people want to live what they\\'d see as a simple life.  In their minds, they want to live the life of the Jamaican fisherman.  So they want to live the life of somebody who doesn\\'t have a lot of money.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But the people who actually do that now are given up their living and essentially entering the tourist sector.  There\\'s a certain amount of weird irony at work here.  Who gets to live in paradise?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nobody because guess what...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got a point.  And I\\'m like clearing the point (inaudible), right?  There\\'s a lot of things going on here, right?  I write a piece of paper couple of months ago that\\'s going on down here, right?  Nature\\'s here.  There are no beach in a few (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s architects model sits on one of GoldenEye\\'s offices, showing what Oracabessa coastline will look like if all goes according to plan.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re going to have an ID to come inside here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re not here about truth, man.  We kill people kill for truth.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, I\\'m telling the truth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m no expert at local politics but whatever is going on here has clearly stirred up some strong emotions.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s where the school kids are going to school. They also want to own their (inaudible) school.  And they are still students...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait up.  Wait up.  Wait up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait a minute, I\\'m talking here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait up.  Wait up.  Wait up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait a minute, Chris.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got to stop talk.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hold on.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you going to stop...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We got to talk really...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right, all right.  Big man, stop talking.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why?  Why?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Come here.  Come here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Go back, go back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Please don\\'t do that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no, just sit down, you know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible), assuming we got to speak back (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is better, to be your own man, uphold family tradition in a dangerous ever shrinking, ever more difficult business, trying to catch fish in the sea or carry golf bag for a wealthy tourist.  I couldn\\'t tell you.  I was in the service industry cooking people\\'s food for most of my working life, so it\\'s not like I have anything against it.  But I don\\'t know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a joyous day.  Let us find the spirit in man and travel to the unknown.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You think because we are here in the present that it just started.  This has come in (inaudible) of the nothingness.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nothingness.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And we are going to go on into nothingness and now into the celestial. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are -- what it\\'s called astral travelers. Travel from dimension to dimension.  If one man dies, all man did.  If one man lives, all man live.  Tolerance (ph).\\n\\nOne dog, one fall, one go, one puss (ph), one moon, one sun.  It has to be multipurpose, you know, to sustain energy and life.  So you have black, blue, green, pink, yellow, river, sea, mountain, birds, dogs, puss (ph), man.  Everything it comes in none such.  Everything is relative.  The chair, the money, everything is connected to the universe.  So if any one person do not realize how vulnerable we are within the chains of time, and we will not disappear, my brethren, is I and I.\\n\\n(COMMERICAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who gets to live in Paradise?  It\\'s Jamaica.\\n\\n(on camera): Let\\'s accept as a basic premise that this is about as close to paradise as it gets, right?  This place I\\'m staying was built by a guy who lived here two months out of year.  That place down there is probably the same, two months a year.  Sad to say, I think it\\'s unlikely that 50 years from now, any one but the extraordinarily fortunate, the extraordinarily connected and the extraordinarily rich will be able to even look at a vista like this.  That is my personal theory.\\n\\nLook, here I am, fully aware of the irony of the situation.  It\\'s like the whole preservation thing.  Who preserve for who?  Save the reef for who?  Save the beach for whom?  Not you, probably.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Later that evening Blackwell invited me to his private bar, just down the cliff from Flemming\\'s old villa.\\n\\n(on camera): There are very few pieces of land anywhere on earth like this, especially with this kind of legendary status.\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  Legendary status, yes, it\\'s Flemming\\'s where Bond\\'s flat space.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Chris Blackwell is the founder of Island Records.  He is credited with discovering Bob Marley and spreading the gospel of reggae into the mainstream all across the world.\\n\\n(on camera): To the extent that one person could sort of be responsible for the soundtrack of your life, you are responsible for much of the soundtrack of my life.  You signed Roxy music and Bryan Eno, both.  Yes?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you have any idea signing Bob Marley of the extent to which his image, alone, would blow up to, you know, Che Guevara level?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  Bob somehow managed to catch people in every corner of the world, different cultures, different societies.  No, I never could have imagined.  I don\\'t think anybody could have imagined it.  It\\'s so unbelievable.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Having sold Island Records for a sum rumored to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Blackwell spends his time, well, doing whatever he wants.\\n\\n(on camera): You have a number of hotel properties, rum business. What\\'s the master plan?  Or you\\'re just having fun?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  Well, always, is to have fun is part of the master plan. You only live around at one time, so I\\'m very excited about here, what we\\'re going to be doing here.  I\\'m trying to break a little resort time that\\'s something that\\'s focused into the town, focused into the parish, focused into the country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Lately, the project at hand is the Oracabessa Fish Sanctuary, set up to protect the local fish habitat and breeding grounds.  A noble cause but one has put Blackwell squarely at odds with some of his neighbors.\\n\\n(on camera): It seems to me that most people who come to Jamaica pretty much stay within the compound of, you know, sandals or whatever, and don\\'t really get out there much.\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  It\\'s a business model and that business model works well for people.\\n\\nThe market that I\\'m going for are the ones on the high level in terms of a high cost level.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it in inevitability that basically all of the Caribbean -- that it\\'s essentially going to end up as a service economy?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  Yes, I think -- yes I think manmade so.  And then it\\'s based on tourism, it\\'s based on people\\'s -- it\\'s tough balance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The engine that\\'s going to preserve or save is often dependent on who\\'s coming to look and what they\\'re willing to pay to come and look.  Can there be a balance do you think.  I mean, can a place this beautiful be unspoiled, forever?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  I think there could be a couple hundred places like this in Jamaica.  As long as there are people who can go and spend some money in communities, go to a little restaurant, go to a little bar, go to, you know, a shop, that\\'s essential for Jamaica to really thrive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If life were a Bond film?  Who would you be in the Bond film?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  Well, there\\'s only one hero in a Bond film.  That\\'s...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'d be the hero?\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  I have to be, yeah.  I have to figure (ph) about this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know who\\'d rather be villain.  I\\'d be like number 17.\\n\\nBLACKWELL:  You know, unhappy ending.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nBLACKWELL:   And his end is quite short, yes.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What we\\'re all looking for, isn\\'t it the perfect beach?  Remote, uncluttered by douchery, cold local beer.  The perfect end to a long and, well, bumpy road.\\n\\nWinifred Beach is that beach.  Mostly locals, a few clued-in visitors, white sand, clear, warm water, and of course local food.\\n\\nCYNTHIA:  This is ackee, Jamaica favorite dish.  Typical in Jamaica we use it as a breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cynthia and Dennis run this place and come highly recommended.  I\\'m told this is the spot for the classic \"Got to have it or you ain\\'t really been to Jamaica,\" ackee and salt fish.  Salt cod, redehydrated and cooked with ackee, a local fruit that happens to be toxic if you don\\'t handle it right.\\n\\n(on-camera): Now, they say best Ackee and salt fish.\\n\\nCYNTHIA:  In Jamaica.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any where.\\n\\n(voice-over): And yeah, also some banana.\\n\\nCYNTHIA:  Delicious?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That is delicious.\\n\\nCYNTHIA:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cynthia\\'s friends Joy and Marjory also have little restaurants or food stalls on the beach and they tell me that here too, it\\'s in danger of redevelopment, that all these might disappear into ever turning wheel of well...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Winifred Beach is a public beach.  It has been one of the best beach in Jamaica.  The beach was left to give the poor people of Jamaica.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So the government takes it over supposedly to make it a public space.  But they want to sell it to a -- what a hotel group?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah, they want to make like a resort.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are a lot of islands in the Caribbean where you\\'re not allowed to own a beach, meaning all beaches are public, even if it\\'s a really exclusive hotel.  At least theoretically anybody can go. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here it\\'s different.  Here if you could by a house and the beach.  You can -- if you\\'re a hotel, you can make it a private beach meaning they don\\'t let have the locals on or vendors or any.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They can keep people out.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how many public-accessed beaches are there in this area?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Just one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just one.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This one, this one no more.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And that\\'s it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No more.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No more beach.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have other beaches around.  We have like Blue Lagoon which is a private beach.  (Inaudible) private and San San is private, so this is the only public one, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, what happens if -- I mean that would be sort of ridiculous if Jamaicans can\\'t go to the beach in Jamaica?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There are two sides to every story of course, and the government for its part, claims locals will still have access to their beach.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We don\\'t trust them.  So we do not believe what they say.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What they want to do.  They wanted (inaudible) and like five, six, seven years, they don\\'t do anything on it until (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(on camera): What kind of monstrous human being or organization would displace...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... the people from their own beach. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  From our freedom.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If they take this away from us...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you very much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  ... we would likely are in prison.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because when time is hot, we would have nowhere to come and swim.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So we, the people, we are in court with the government because we do not want them to take away the one and only beach that we have in Jamaica (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think your chances are?  Do you think your chances are good?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re going to win?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  I\\'ve been fighting over seven years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We trust in the Lord.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Seven years?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In seven years.  And I I\\'ve said I\\'m going to fight until I reach the top.  When I reach the top and I lose, I feel much better.  But I\\'m not giving up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Let\\'s face it.  There are only so many beaches in this world, even fewer unspoiled beaches.  And even fewer beaches like this.\\n\\n(on camera): I mean that\\'s one of the things that\\'s nice about this area, is it\\'s not a big resort area like some of the other parts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And the food is amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nice food here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can\\'t get this at the hotel.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That is not like this. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That is so fresh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Really, really, really taste, I mean I - I\\'m going to have to come back here like tomorrow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Whenever people come here and they have problem, they go to the sea and they look over there in the ocean, and when they are finish they never have a problem again.  It go right in the water and down.  We got (inaudible) here.  And I hope that the world can see what is going on at Winifred Beach.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And that they come and enjoy the beauty of the beach, the nature of the beach, the people and the love of the beach.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Next day, and I know where I\\'m going.  Because you never know, because it may not be here that much longer, not like this anyway.\\n\\nSun, sand, rum and tea (ph), and some more food.\\n\\n(on camera): Oh, yeah.\\n\\nHi.  Wow.  What a spread.  I\\'m not going hungry today beautiful. Thank you.  I\\'m so excited.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is actually quite delicious.  You\\'re not missing out on starches.  When you get yam, breadfruit, rice, peas, corn, carrots, dumpling, festival (ph).\\n\\n(voice-over): I (inaudible) instead eat desert first, life is uncertain.\\n\\n(on camera):  That\\'s good.  I knew I was coming back here.  And it was the smart move to come back here.  This place is (Inaudible).\\n\\n(voice-over):  Point being the way world turns, the inevitable grind of history seems to indicate that places like this and people like this, get plowed under, pushed aside, paid over.\\n\\nWho owns paradise after all?  Who in the end gets to own paradise, use paradise or even visit it?  That\\'s a question that\\'s probably worth paying attention to, before there\\'s none left at all.\\n\\n(on camera): How do you do this and be a good person?  I don\\'t think you can.  Like if you wanted to do this regularly for the rest of your life, I would like to spend three months out of the year in a hammock looking at the Caribbean in a secluded beach like this.  You have to do bad things to do this, right?\\n\\nJames Bond doesn\\'t get this.  James Bond\\'s a hustler.  He gets this for couple of days before he moves on to next location.  The guy who lives here is the Quantum villain not James Bond.\\n\\nIan Fleming was much closer to like Blofeld or Hugo Drax.  You know, these guys have lots of leisure time sitting around in hammocks, figuring out how to take over the world.  Lot of downtime in the world domination.  Bond was a working class.  It\\'s what I\\'ve been missing.\\n\\nAll right, go like summon the robot piranhas.  Where\\'s my cocktail?\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  This is where I bought my first bag of heroin.  It was 1980.  I was 24 years old.  But in a lot of ways, my whole life up to that point was leading to this address.  Western Massachusetts, the unlikely new frontier of America\\'s war on drugs, where heroin has become an exploding problem that\\'s begun to touch nearly every family.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s nothing like the North Atlantic.  It\\'s majestic.  I love the beach.  Pretty much had my first everything on a beach.  You name it, first time I did it, beach.  I was miserable in love, happy in love, alternately, as only a 17-year-old could be.  This is where I lived.  Very happy summer in the early \\'70s, and that was my room on the left.  It\\'s an amazing spot if you think about it, a bunch of knuckleheads working as dishwashers, waiters, pizza servers.  We could work on a beach like this.  You know, happier, stupider times.\\n\\nYou know, I can still hear the play list, Strawberry Letter and the Brothers Johnson.  If you put on Marvin Gaye right now, I\\'d burst into tears.  What do you do?  You\\'re young, you go to the beach, you know, you get laid, and you get high.\\n\\nIt was here, all the way out at the tip of Cape Cod, Provincetown, Massachusetts, where the pilgrims first landed.  And it was where I first landed.\\n\\n1972, washed in a town with a headful of orange sunshine and a few friends.  Provincetown, a wonderland of tolerance, long time tradition of accepting artists, writers, the badly behaved, the gay, the different.  It was paradise.\\n\\nThe joy that can only come with an absolute certainty that you\\'re invincible, that none of the choices that you make will have any repercussions or any effect on your later life.  We didn\\'t think about those things.  I don\\'t even know what I thought I was going to be.  At that point, I certainly didn\\'t think I was going to be a cook.  I don\\'t know what I thought I was going to be.  I was just, you know, hanging out in a beautiful place.\\n\\nA golden time.  I look back on those fuzzy memories, and they seem golden anyway.  Oh, there\\'s John Waters.  First love.  And there\\'s me. This guy, Johnny Yingling, was sort of a sinful figure in all of our lives.  JOHN YINGLING, SPIRITUS PIZZA:  Well, my name is John Yingling, and\\n\\nthis is Spiritus Pizza.  It\\'s been here since 1971.  This town is everything to me.  Provincetown is a really special place, where people can be themselves.\\n\\nWe all did drugs, acted young and crazy, and Tony was -- he was probably a little wilder than some and not as wild as others.  But he was always the guy who I always liked.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And you let me sleep on top of the walk-in.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Right.  I actually remember that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At Spiritus.\\n\\nI cannot tell you how frequently I dream about Spiritus Pizza.  I\\'m walking down Commercial Street, and I\\'m sort of dimly aware that Spiritus has moved, and there\\'s a sense of dislocation and a loss as I stumble around this sort of Provincetown dreamscape of 40 years ago. I was still here and living in hope.  Unbelievable.\\n\\nMany of the old places in p-town are gone.  But the lobster pot is still going strong, all these years later, and still has what I want and need.  The essentials.\\n\\nMy friends worked in the kitchen here, starting the tradition among my set that cooking work was noble toil.  At that point, I never intended a career as a chef.\\n\\nYINGLING:  It\\'s great to be a cook.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was getting to that.  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is homemade Portuguese kale soup, made on the premises.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s been a long time, thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Enjoy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Portuguese soup, a p-town version of the Azorean caldo verde, and just what I remembered.  Kale, fiery red chorizo, linguica, kidney beans, potatoes.\\n\\nOh, I missed you.  I missed you bad.\\n\\nAnd that was precisely what I loved about the food here.  The Portuguese thing, dishes like this stuffed cod crusted with ground Portuguese sausage, bread crumbs, stuffed with scallop and crab.  Some sherry, red sauce.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t been working for a while, I was a deadbeat.  I was just scarfing off everybody else.  And Nancy Poole (ph) comes home from work and says, our dishwasher didn\\'t show up today.  You are our new dishwasher.  And I said, oh, really?  And the next day I put on the apron and I didn\\'t take it off for 30 years.  I\\'d wake up, all of us would go to the beach, hang out on the beach until like 2:00, 3:00.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Yes, it was fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Roll into work.  Work all night.  Drinking, getting high, drilling out food.  You have got all the food you wanted, all the liquor you wanted?\\n\\nYINGLING:  All the sex you wanted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All the sex you wanted.\\n\\nYINGLING:  It was true, it was fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And yet it was still an essential part of the economy.\\n\\nYINGLING:  It was a lot of fun, believe me, I remember.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The flagship, it\\'s where my cooking career started.  Where I started washing dishes, where I started have pretensions of culinary grandeur.\\n\\nIt would seem like a good gig for anybody.  Who else got to live like that during that time?  You had to sort of be in a band, here we were, we were dishwashers.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Yes, you get a little older and you get a little more sense and you realize that like, you know, you got to like pace yourself a little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Otherwise, we still wouldn\\'t be here.  Well, you know, many of our friends from those days didn\\'t make it.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Many of my friends are dead, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Keep drinking, keep drinking.  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This place has been here forever.\\n\\nThat used to be the back room.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Back room\\'s still there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  See, it\\'s all falling into place again.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Yes.  It\\'s not that much different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s early spring now, but come Memorial Day, it gets crazy around here, and doesn\\'t stop until Labor Day.  Provincetown was always gay-friendly, in my time and way, way before my time.  And this place, the Atlantic House, known always and forever by locals and visitors alike as the A House, is America\\'s oldest operating gay bar. Everybody has come through these doors, so to speak.  Most notably, naked and frolicking Tennessee Williams.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  That\\'s really too bad.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody got seasick and started tripping.  Now that (inaudible) they all (inaudible) cocktails so I can get my sea legs back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  April Cabral (ph) owns the joint now, taking over for her father, the legendary Reggie Cabral, a forward-thinking dude if there ever was one.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was built in 1798.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long in the family?  In your family?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Over 75 years.  My father during that time, he had Billy Holiday appeared, he had Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, all the big names of jazz.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How has town changed?  Has it changed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, I think tremendously.  Gay lifestyle is much more accepted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay, 1972, my feeling was that this was a gay town, and that I was here at the pleasure of, you know, somebody else, which is sort of the opposite of everywhere outside of here at that time.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This was a largely Catholic, Portuguese, conservative fishing community, but it was also known as Hell Town.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Hell Town, there\\'s where the puritans sent their rejects. Right out here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Yes.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nYINGLING:  Not kidding.  Provincetown always had the mixture really of the Bohemian people and the fishermen, the pirates, the writers, the drunks, all that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Anyone who had a lifestyle outside the mainstream was welcome here pretty much.\\n\\nYINGLING:  Whatever floats your boat.  You know.  It\\'s all good.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOURDAIN:  Over a century ago, Provincetown was a hard working fishing village with multigenerational families of fishermen.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My name\\'s Bo Gribbon (ph).  My father fished, and I was pretty much raised here my whole life.  Where I\\'m from.  This is who I am.  But it used to be like two out of three families in this town, in this community, were fishing families.  Most of them are now gone.  And we\\'re really like a minority.  Used to be a fishing community with a homosexual problem.  Now it\\'s a homosexual community with a fishing problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The first Portuguese fishermen arrived here in 1840.  The main families created a community built around fishing, and this town lived off that industry well into the 20th century.  It persisted even when I was here, keeping up old Catholic fishing traditions like the blessing of the fleet.  These days, however, there are fewer and fewer boats to bless.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My name\\'s Scott Roe (ph), I\\'m a commercial fishermen.  Sea scallops, fourth generation.  Started when I was 5. It was cool back then.  There were like 70, 80 boats here, there were five or six feet, now it\\'s just down to like seven or eight.  Now I\\'m wicked proud of my heritage and I would never do anything else.  This is my office, man, look at it.  I\\'m going to do this until I can\\'t move anymore.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We were all on the town like clockwork, 2:30, 3:00 in the morning, it\\'s quiet, the town\\'s been ripped up all night long. We come down here, hit the water.  What could be better?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good time to be here, and nice weather today.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, nice day.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Little breezy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Might be a little nautical.  A little bit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m sure I\\'ll be fine, I\\'ve watched \"The Deadliest Catch.\" So.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m ready.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Time to press the fun button.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clear?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All clear.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Used to be this was the best thing in the world. The greatest thing about fishing was, you were kind of like a cowboy, like a pioneer, you could go out, and as hard as you could push, competition was welcomed.  We were fiercely independent.  Independence is like little by little by little taken away.  BOURDAIN:  Is there a limited number of stuff out there?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, there\\'s a total allowable catch.  We\\'re on a 600 pound trip right now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And the payout ain\\'t much.  Do the math, a good day of scalloping brings in, say, 9,000 bucks.  From that 9,000, take away 3,000 for the lease, 1,000 for fuel, and split the remainder amongst the crew.  And on top of that, fishing is really just a crap shoot. Many days, there\\'s simply nothing to catch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why the [ bleep ] are you doing this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We love to do it.\\n\\nLike for us, we say it all turns to ship when we come around the break water.  Once we get out to there, we feel like we\\'re at home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like I said, it ain\\'t easy.  Today, according to Bo, Scott, and Zeb, this was just a little breeze.\\n\\nHow rough does it have to be when you look out and say I\\'m not going out today?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It starts like blowing like 30, 35.  We like days like this because the competition stays in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My dad used to say if you\\'re staying dry, you\\'re not making any money.  We\\'re fishing.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not too often.  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I hate when that happens.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, it\\'s a bummer.  In the summer, you\\'d be able to smell the coconut, another big trick we have.  Now the guys decided they like this part of the beach, right.  So they\\'re all out here, nude sunbathing.  So I pick up my glasses and I tell them, wow, look at the breasts on that girl.  And you give it to them and they see something they weren\\'t expecting to see.  Works every time, though.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t cook nothing.\\n\\nI can\\'t believe it, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Got Anthony Bourdain on deck and we don\\'t have nothing to eat.\\n\\nThe best part of it, the anticipation to see what\\'s in there.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh every time.  I\\'m like, I just can\\'t wait.\\n\\nYou\\'re like, look and you\\'re like what\\'s going to be in there?  What\\'s going to be in there?  Sometimes it\\'s a disappointment.  But a lot of times, it\\'s disappointment.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How many did we get?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A few.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is there?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right, we\\'re out.  That\\'s why it\\'s fishing and not catching.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yep.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Going to taste all that much better.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This place was -- has been here forever when I rolled into town.  How long has that place been open?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For a long time.\\n\\nI think this is the only place in town that\\'s unchanged.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, how long do I have to drink here to get my face up there?  40 years?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Couple more years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Back when I worked in town for fishermen, there was the Folksel (ph), Cookie\\'s Tap Room (ph), and this place.  The Old Colony. Of the three, it\\'s the only one left.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, baby.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, wait a minute, I recognize these.  You guys eat scallops?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As brawny, hard working men of the sea, we deserve these beers, these finest of all oysters, the wellfleets.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Finest oysters known to man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These are fantastic.  Wow, what a treat.  Is there going to be a next generation of fishermen in the family?  What happens after you guys?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The next generation of fishermen that are like\\n\\ncoming on to our boats, they\\'re opportunist for the income, it\\'s not for the love of being on the water.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the end.  The fishing is going to die. Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  Thank you, guys.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is going to end badly.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a nice house.  Man, it just feels like I never left in a lot of ways.  But it was 40 years later almost.  That was the Sodom and Gomorra by the sea over there, you know, a big candy store for horny, stupid, 17-year-olds with a taste for chemicals.  You know, I was an angry young man.  What the hell was so I angry about?  It came as a rude surprise to me when I turned 30 because I always sort of figured I\\'d be dead by then.\\n\\nI was still quite some time away from my first bag of heroin, but, you know, in a lot of ways, it was a foregone conclusion.  My whole life was sort of leading up to that point.  To my first bag of dope.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I left Provincetown with restaurant experience, a suntan, and an ever deepening relationship with recreational drugs.  I went to culinary school, then to New York City, and never returned.  Today, however, I\\'m staying in Massachusetts, heading over to the western part of the state, one of the most beautiful areas of the country. The gorgeous mill towns, Victorian houses, deeply felt famously upright New England values, Norman Rockwell America, where something really inexplicable and unexpected has happened.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  New England is a new mecca for heroin use.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- but never happened before.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Detectives are working around the clock. Dealers are making a killing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not New York or Baltimore or L.A. or Chicago, but rural towns like this one are now statistically ground zero for the heroin epidemic.\\n\\nWhat the hell happened?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The next couple years, if this heroin use trend continues to grow, it may be beyond getting a handle on.  I\\'m a detective with the Greenfield Police Department here, and my focus is undercover and narcotic investigations.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a well-known area to us, and very active.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Heroin use in the past year, it\\'s just increased to a level I\\'ve never seen any other drug come into an area.  People who are in it are all going to be affected.  It hasn\\'t topped out yet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Someone you have known, someone you went to school with, someone you work with.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, Sonny Crockett gets a Ferrari.  What\\'s wrong with this picture?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I tried the Lexus, but they said no way.  So I got this one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s been reported in the national papers there\\'s been an explosion of heroin use, heroin-related crimes, overdoses.  How does that happen?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think once this area realized we had a heroin problem, we were already behind it, trying to play catch-up.  We are on the 91 corridor.  Route 91 has been dubbed the heroin highway at this point.  It\\'s a widely used road to go north and south.  There\\'s opportunists here, and for low money input, they\\'re getting a high profit.  That\\'s the typical heroin packaging  Bundles of ten, 50 bags here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So 60 to 80 bucks for ten.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They can charge what they want.  It\\'s all supply and demand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One dose per for most people?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'ll do multiple bags, anywhere from three to five bags at a time, 30 bags a day.  And the current economics of the town, I am the only one assigned to the narcotics position.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many heroin addicts you think are walking the streets of Greenfield right now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m going to say we\\'re in the high hundreds.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re in the high hundreds.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  High hundreds.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s hitting every age group, economic household, it\\'s out there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We don\\'t have Crips and Bloods taking over motel rooms. The person selling you dope more likely to be familiar than a stranger?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Going to meet a house distributor I\\'ve known for several years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We meet Carmen, as we\\'ll call her, a powerful local heroin dealer turned paid confidential police informant, out in the woods.\\n\\nHow\\'d you get into the business initially?\\n\\nCARMEN:  I needed the money.  I needed to support my family.  Couldn\\'t get a job.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How easy was it to get into the dope business?\\n\\nCARMEN:  Not hard at all.  Because it\\'s cheap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Was there money in it?\\n\\nCARMEN:  Oh, hell yes.  Yes, oh yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s like Mayberry out here from looking around.  Who\\'s using heroin now?  I mean --\\n\\nCARMEN:  Kids.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kids.\\n\\nCARMEN:  Kids.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Today\\'s heroin epidemic is different than the one that raged through America in the 1970s, in a few significant ways.  Back then, heroin was mostly seen as a poor people problem, somebody else\\'s problem.  The sort of thing that musicians and criminals got into, marginal people, far from the white Main Streets of Mayberry, USA. What those people did to themselves, well, it was unfortunate, but not our problem.  Until somebody broke into your house.\\n\\nToday, it\\'s absolutely the reverse.  The new addicts are almost entirely white, middle class, and from towns and areas like this.\\n\\nHow do you think you make it better?\\n\\nCARMEN:  You don\\'t.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa.  You don\\'t?\\n\\nCARMEN:  No.  There\\'s going to be more robberies, there\\'s going to be more killings.  Take one person off the street here, two more come in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many customers do you have?\\n\\nCARMEN:  Practically all of Greenfield.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happened?  How did the kid next door, along with mom, pop, and grandma too, become users of hard-core illegal narcotic drugs, the worst drug, with the worst reputation?  Well, maybe start here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Once you found the right doctor and have told him or her about your pain, don\\'t be afraid to take what they give you. Often, it will be an opioid medication.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s a 1996 promotional video from the fine folks at Purdue Pharmaceuticals.  Sent around to doctors, it encouraged them to prescribe the latest, newest, more wonderful drug for long-term pain management, OxyContin.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some patients may be afraid of taking opioids because they\\'re perceived at too strong or addictive.  But that\\'s far from actual fact.  Less than 1 percent of patients taking opioids actually become addicted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sales of OxyContin -- initially and falsely proclaimed as not addictive -- absolutely skyrocketed, from $45 million in 1996 to $3.1 billion in 2010.  That same year, Purdue tweaked the way they were making Oxy in an attempt to, they said, limit its addictive qualities.\\n\\nFinally, the government and law enforcement took a harsh look at the drug, and it became much harder to get legally, which sucked for the thousands and thousands who by now had a serious habit.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am Ruth Putie (ph), a family physician in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and I grew up here.  My dad was actually a small town doctor out here.  I\\'m a total generalist, but for the last four, four and a half years, a larger part of my practice has been focussed on addiction to opioids.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I got put on pain medication.  Then when they started disappearing, everybody else is doing it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The heroin?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  I can get a bag of heroin easier than I can get a joint.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Once they start, they just slip down that rabbit hole, and, you know, maybe they make it out.  That\\'s our goal is to get them out and to live healthy again.  We\\'ve really in our own way created this mess we\\'re in now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In downtown Greenfield, the People\\'s Pint, an ecoconscious, local locavorian pub that brews its own beer, uses only farm fresh ingredients, and composts its leftovers.  It\\'s where I meet up with Dr. Putie for dinner.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I guess my first question is, who\\'s doing dope?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody starts with the pills.  There\\'s nobody--\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody starts with pills.  There\\'s nobody who goes from marijuana to heroin.  There\\'s an in-between step.  Always pills, it\\'s pills that people get from their doctor.  From me. Particularly the young people.  Had an injury, a sports-related injury, had their wisdom teeth out, and they felt awesome on the drug, and they were like how can I get more of that?  After three to six months of looking for more of that, they couldn\\'t find it, and then they jumped.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it big pharma\\'s fault?  Is it doctors\\' fault?  Who\\'s fault is it?  Who made a mistake here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it\\'s complicated.  I\\'m not going to say there\\'s one entity here that\\'s responsible, but there was a lot of money to be made by promoting the treatment of pain to the highest level.  Big pharma made a lot of money on this.  And I was taught in residency, you give people as much pain medicine as they need.  You get them out of pain, we\\'ll judge your hospital, we\\'ll judge your emergency room based on your pain scores.  That\\'s how we were taught. And we were also told these medicines aren\\'t all that addictive.  We started handing out pills like crazy.\\n\\n100 million Americans have chronic pain.  So, we did a disservice as doctors and as prescribers, like we took data that was [ bleep ], right, and then we went forth with it and said, oh, prescribe it to everyone, they won\\'t get addicted.  We know what we\\'re doing.  Guess what, we didn\\'t know what we were doing.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few miles down the road from Greenfield is Shellburn Falls.  The good old days that everyone used to talk about back when I was a kid.  Sundays, church and picnics.  Saturday nights, Sox games, beer, and bowling.  The Shellburn Falls bowling alley is where time seems anyway to have stopped.  First opened in 1906, this is the second oldest bowling alley in America.  Dedicated to old school New England-style candle pin bowling.  The holy rollers, the crowd of septuagenarians who grew up in Shellburn and plan -- and this is a reasonable expectation -- to kick my ass.  They\\'ve been playing here since the \\'50s.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I was never allowed to come near the bowling alley.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really, this was the den of inequity?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This was -- my aunt did not think this was a good idea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Man, it\\'s a tiny little ball.  This looks really hard.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s very different, Shellburn Falls.  I grew up here.  Very different.  People don\\'t know each other as well as everyone used to know each other.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When I grew up in Greenfield, everybody had jobs. I worked from the time I was 13.  If I had to go back there now, I don\\'t believe in drugs, I don\\'t have anything to do with them, but, what choice would I have?  Standing on the corner, I would probably get into a business.  What\\'s a good business?  Well-paying business? I\\'m sorry.  That\\'s where we are.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, it used to be a very different world, towns like this one.  And there were many.  But like everywhere else, it seems the mills, the factories closed down, and with them a certain kind of social contract with the people who worked there.\\n\\nED GREGORY:  My name is Ed Gregory, originally from Terrence Falls (ph), born and brought up here, born in 1945.  My father was an employee of this draft mill, as was my grandfather.\\n\\nDuring the hay day, there were three paper mills, a cotton mill, a silk mill, a foundry, which was just a beehive of activity here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Back then, a company town like this, the company actually took care of you.  They built and provided homes for their employees. Schools.  The river provided energy.  The company provided nearly everything else.\\n\\nGREGORY:  The hay day is gone.  People are definitely struggling to find work.  The town just kind of died during the \\'80s.\\n\\nWhen the folks came to work, they were immigrants.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Attracted by the manufacturing here.\\n\\nGREGORY:  Correct.  Made it a possibility of owning a home in a real decent part of the county here.\\n\\nSo my father was here, a millwright.  A millwright\\'s job is a jack of all trades, if you will.  If there was something that needed to be repaired.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you could work in a mill and live in a nice home, send your kids to school, make a living, all on a mill salary.\\n\\nGREGORY:  You bet.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s unthinkable now almost.  What happened to the business?\\n\\nGREGORY:  Things are going to other countries, but not coming back to the United States.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This town became redundant?\\n\\nGREGORY:  Correct.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Again and again all over the country, I keep running into situations like this.  Where industry has died or fled or simply relocated.  I meet people like Charles Garbel (ph), hometown heroes who for some reason -- though they could probably go anywhere -- take their skills and return to where they grew up.  Shady Glenn Diner. Today\\'s special, a tribute to the old European immigrant culture of the area, the New England boiled dinner.\\n\\nSo I hear rumors of corned beef and cabbage, is that right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Every week we do a corned beef and cabbage dinner.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Slowly cooked corned beef, boiled potatoes, steamed cabbage.\\n\\nThat\\'s a beast, awesome, thank you.\\n\\nHow long have you been here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you from the area?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  I grew up here, and I\\'ve been coming through here since a kid.  And went through a few owners and then it came up for sale, and decided to give it a shot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Generally speaking, who are your customers?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Most of them are retirees, they\\'ve been coming here since they were 30.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And this, you don\\'t see so much anymore.  Homemade pies and lots of them.  All baked on premises.  Raspberry cream pie for me, thank you.  This is not something we see a lot of.  Old school pie like that, and this number of them?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everything is made here.  And they\\'re all the original recipes from the \\'60s.  The index cards are so old, they\\'re all faded yellow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just exotic for me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.  How\\'s business?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s getting better.  The drug problem has started to really get rampant.  Took over May 1st, 2012, and by the end of that year, I was broken into four times.  It wasn\\'t just me, though, it was multiple businesses time after time.  I came in one morning to open up, and I actually had a guy in front of the register, and he got up, pulled a knife out.  I realized it really wasn\\'t worth anything over a knife.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I think what you\\'re doing here is terrific.  A man can go and get a good pot open turkey sandwich and a good slice of pie, it\\'s a beautiful thing.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My name is Heather Taylor (ph).  I\\'m a mother of three.  The two older kids experienced my addiction.\\n\\nMy addiction started with pills.  I started sniffing heroin.  I shot up for the first time, and shortly there later, I found out I was pregnant.  I had my daughter.  She was in the hospital for six weeks because she was addicted to the methadone, and I had to watch my baby go through withdrawal.\\n\\nMy son was four, and my daughter was six weeks when they were taken away.  I lost my kids for 33 days shy of two years.\\n\\nI became serious about my recovery.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So is this the bad part of town or is this just a place where you\\'re unlikely for people to find you?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Just a place where people are unlikely to find you.  I wouldn\\'t necessarily say there was a bad part of Greenfield. I mean, it\\'s probably pretty spread out bad, I guess you\\'d say.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What would you do?  Would you just come here to shoot up?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yep.  You know, we\\'d go down here and just hang out down there.  I bet if we walked along here, we\\'d probably find needles and bags.  You know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So basically you\\'d come down here, shoot up, and what are you going to nod out?  Just sit down --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Just sit down and hang out.  On a day like this, probably just hang out under the underpass over there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not exactly la vida loca.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  As you can see, all the trash and yuck, it\\'s dirty and gross.  There\\'s probably people who live down here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, there\\'s a lot of homeless people in Greenfield.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think now when you see somebody who\\'s clearly junk sick on the street?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It gives me that yuck, sick feeling.  And it scares me.  It reminds me why I don\\'t want to be out there.  It\\'s just scary.  A friend of mine overdosed January 1st of this year.  And my brother-in-law overdosed in Wendy\\'s bathroom, and they found him.  And they brought him back to life.  He was dead in the bathroom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-huh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So this is my Narcan.  I carry this around, I have one of these in my house and I have one in my car.  I have a fear that my husband\\'s going to relapse and I\\'m going to find him dead. You just put this in here and squirt it up their nose.  BOURDAIN:  Now in most cases, as I understand it, they\\'re right out of\\n\\nit.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They\\'re right out of it and they are instantly sick.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They don\\'t wake up happy.  But they wake up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They wake up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  (inaudible) you walk to the bathroom and there\\'s somebody\\'s blue there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Somebody on the floor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you saving that life?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yep, saving that life.  Absolutely.  And then kicking their ass.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Better now?  life better now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Absolutely.  My kids have been home three years. You know, I no longer have to watch my back.  You know, I live a pretty straight and narrow life.  Which, you know, people might say is boring, but I love my life today.  I\\'m grateful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where are we headed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, okay.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To the Recover Project.  This is where my recovery started.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Started nearly a decade ago in one of the two Main Streets of Greenfield, the Recover Project is community-based.  An open arms program aimed at helping addicts stay clean.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Given the opioid heroin epidemic in our community, we\\'d like to start the conversation.  Just kind of sharing with one another, you know, what happened at that point of our life, what that was like.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So as a child growing up in a home of addiction, I didn\\'t understand how they could do all the stuff that they did to me and my brother and sister.  Like don\\'t you love me enough?  Then I became a mother, and then I became a heroin addict.  And I did all that stuff to my kids.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My doctor was my biggest drug dealer.  I felt down a flight of stairs, I\\'d just been married, had a baby, was working two jobs, college on top of it.  Next thing I know, I\\'m on these prescriptions, that\\'s where it all began for me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are the odds you\\'re going to own a house? What\\'s the odds you\\'re going to have a nice car?  Any car?  A place to live, all that stuff?  Seems less and less likely all the time. Contrast that with what happens when you stick a spike in your arm. And I wouldn\\'t.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So I have this picture in my head of when I got the phone call that my daughter\\'s father had been in the accident, and I just had a c-section, and they come in with this needle to give me Adavin (ph), I think, and all I really needed was a hug, like I just needed someone to come up to me and give me a hug, and say I care about you, Kaitlyn (ph), and everything is going to be okay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll tell you something really shameful about myself.  The first time I shot up, I looked at myself in the mirror with a big grin.  You know, something was missing in me, whether it was a self- image situation, whether it was a character flaw.  I came from a stable family, the suburbs, you know, I had a lot of advantages. There was some dark genie inside me that I very much hesitate to call a disease, that led me to dope.  You know, I didn\\'t have anyone else who could have talked me out of what I was doing, but intervention wouldn\\'t have worked.  I didn\\'t have a child.  I have a 7-year-old daughter now, who I never would have had.  I never would have thought -- I looked in a mirror and I saw somebody worth saving, or that I wanted to at least try real hard and save.\\n\\nYou know, anybody can find themself very easily in this situation, and, you know, I look back on that and I think about what I\\'ll tell my daughter, you know.  You know, that was daddy.  Ain\\'t no doubt about it, but I hope I\\'ll be able to say that was daddy then, this is daddy now, that I\\'m alive and living in hope.  Thank you, guys.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In Massachusetts, the clambake is a ritual going back to the Flintstones, before the pilgrims.  Today at the long-standing locals only shooting club, Shootsenverrin (ph) as it\\'s called in German for the immigrants who fist started this rustic fraternity back in 1912.  Club leader Ray Zurkowski (ph) takes me through the fascinating and arcane process of creating an old-school clambake.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Basically we build a kiln with hardwood and stone. We burn it down, remove the wood, and cover it with seaweed and corn husks, and we put our clams and lobsters and corn in there like a pressure cooker.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ve got a pig hiding in there also.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no, no.  We\\'re going to pull a husker out right now and you can kind of see what we have got here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s eat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First some good chowder, and there really is only one kind of chowder, New England clam chowder.\\n\\nMm-mm.  That is good.\\n\\nSteamer clams, lobster, corn, potatoes.  It\\'s a pretty luxurious clambake you got going here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That was amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody\\'s attention for a second.  The opioid education and awareness task force came together several months ago. I don\\'t think we realized how quickly this could turn into a crisis for us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody in this room has been touched by or impacted by narcotics in some way.  The Franklin County opioid safety task force is a grassroots response.  Doctors, law enforcement, led by Franklin County Sheriff Chris Donelan, addiction specialists and addicts themselves are coming together to find a community-based solution to what is finally being recognized as a public health crisis rather than simply a criminal justice problem.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a great opportunity to come here tonight to break bread and look at the successes that we have had so far.  Think what makes me more proud than anything else about living in Franklin County is that we will not sit back and wait for anybody else to solve this problem for us.  We\\'ll be a model for the commonwealth and for the nation on how we save our young people and how we save our community.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Again, it\\'s a change.  The city is the place where all of the bad stuff was supposed to happen, it wasn\\'t supposed to be in nice towns like Greenfield.  Right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It isn\\'t the image that people used to have 20 years ago, that it\\'s a junkie in an alley somewhere using a needle. It\\'s not.  It\\'s your kids, it\\'s your neighbors.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The worst I think is when you have these young people who break a leg and they go to the doctor and they get a prescription for Oxy and become addicted to it.  These are any kid who plays a high school sport.  It\\'s a horrible circumstance when it happens.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It only started in the past couple of years.  Yes, the heroin was around, the pills were around, but we didn\\'t have people dying.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once you\\'ve been busted for heroin, that\\'s a hard thing to live down.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Got to get rid of that shame factor so people can\\n\\ndeal with it, address it, and get support from the community.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel like we\\'ll lose a generation, of our young people, 18 to 22, is what we\\'re seeing the most.  The district attorney, the sheriff, myself, the police department are all united. This task force has grown to over 100 people in a matter of six months, and that\\'s what we\\'re committed to doing, and we\\'ll do it until the day I die.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I lost one daughter to drugs.  You know, whatever it takes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s start by being honest with ourselves.  As a nation, for decades, we were perfectly happy to write off whole neighborhoods, whole cities, whole generations of young men and women.  As long as it was an inner city problem, an urban problem, which is to say a black people problem, a brown people problem.  Send them to prison into a system from which they\\'ll never return.  Maybe now, now that it\\'s really come home to roost, now that it\\'s the high school quarterback, your next-door neighbor, your son, your daughter, now that grandma is as likely to be a junkie as anyone else, we\\'ll accept that there has never been a real war on drugs.  War on drugs implies an us versus them, and all over this part of America, people are learning there is no them.  There is only us.  And we\\'re going to have to figure this out together.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  What are our expectations?  Which of the things we desire are within reach?  If not now, when?  And will there be some left for me?\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China\\'s younger generation is driving growth in...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is where the real power is, China.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you love in Manhattan like I do and you think you live in the center of the world, this place, Shanghai, will confront you with a very different reality.  Turn down a side street, it\\'s an ancient culture.  A century\\'s old mix of culinary traditions, smells, flavors.  A block away, this.  An ultra-modern, ever clanging cash register, levels of wealth, of luxury, a sheer volume of things and services unimagined by the greediest most bushwa of capitalist imperialist.\\n\\nThe city is split by the Huanpu River, a tributary of Yangtze.  In the older section which appears the Bund and a newer built-up section, the Pudong.  The one thing I know for sure about China is I will never know China.  It\\'s too big, too old, too diverse, too deep.  There\\'s simply not enough time.  That\\'s for me the joy of China, facing a learning curve that impossibly steep.  The certain knowledge that even if I dedicated my life to learning about China, I die mostly ignorant. That\\'s exciting, it\\'s too much and it\\'s changing so fast.\\n\\nChina has a population of around 1.2 billion people, and the number of them who were joining an explosive middle class, demanding their share of all that good stuff, infrastructure, the clothes, the cars, the gas to fuel them, his wealth, it\\'s the engine that might well drive the whole world.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  Do you like Chinese food?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Very much, yes.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  OK.  What do you want?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\\\\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Please order.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of course, yes some -- dumplings.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  (speaking in a foreign language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Professor Zhou Lin is an economist and current dean of the College of Economics and Management at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I saw many people who live here who\\'s Chinese but was educated in American universities.  Has had taught at Yale, Duke, and Arizona State.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you -- forgive me.  Economics are not my area of expertise, I wallow in ignorance but China looks different every time I come.  It\\'s changing so, so, so quickly.  How did that happen?\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  China enjoy, you know, this long period of peace.  No serious enemy, no major wars.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  So the manufacturing industry really took off.  Internally is reformed (ph) an open door policy, every country willing to trade with Chiana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s certainly no doubt that at this point, we -- our destinies are inextricably bound up.  We are hopelessly -- our economies are hopelessly intermingled.  If one fails, the effect would be disastrous.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  Global impact.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We are -- to say the least.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  It\\'s suddenly...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (speaking in a foreign language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So beautiful.  This is what I was waiting for.\\n\\n(voice-over): Xiaolongbao, literally small steaming basket buns, but I translate them on my head to pillows of happiness that will scald your tongue and throat if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nLook, there are lot of reasons to come to China, and to Shanghai in particular.  But these babies done right, these things alone are worth the trip.  Ground pork and shrimp folded exactly and always 20 times inside freshly-made individual rolled-out dough.  As they\\'re steamed, the delicious, delicious fat renders, it was soup of the gods, which then if you\\'re not careful, causes unforgettable maxillofacial damage, as it changes your life forever.\\n\\n(on comera): So good.\\n\\n(voice-over): In the China of the future, places like this, Foshan Jiaolong, will be even more packed by Chinese, by expats, by visitors looking for the deeply satisfying rush of screamingly hot goodness, the chewy, meaty, deeply savory, fragrant, perfectly shaped and folded ballistically-designed delivery vehicles for pure pleasure.\\n\\nAnd the allure of Shanghai-style pork chop, zhu zhu pai (ph) served with lajiangyou, their local take on Worcestershire sauce.  It\\'s irresistible.\\n\\nZHOU LIN (on camera):  So I really believe that the world is converging and China will again, will be privatizing more and more.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  But the difference -- nowadays, it\\'s just the technology is so advanced, we don\\'t really meet that many (ph) people.  So two things that many (ph) use to do in which the population, 7 billion people, there was probably, doesn\\'t need that many people working...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZHOU LIN:  So the question is that what should human beings doing, you know?  How can you let them not doing anything and then still living a good life?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZHOU LIN: I don\\'t know.  It\\'s going to be a big issue at the face of the whole world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What is the future, I don\\'t know.  But to a very great extent, it is surely being determined here.  Is there a plan?  Probably not, only appetites.  And increasingly, the means to fulfill those appetites, those dreams and aspirations.  Who will drive the car that takes us to wherever we are going?  They will be young whoever they are, and not unlike Yao Minji (ph), a 30-year old Shanghai native educated in the USA at Wellesley, currently a Features reporter for the Shanghai Daily.\\n\\nShe maybe the picture of modern China, but this is Minji\\'s (ph) favorite restaurant, Chiong (ph).  China and Shanghai in particularly might be transforming fast, but this place stays resolutely the same.\\n\\nMrs. Shu (ph) runs the place, serving classic home-style Shanghai meals.  There\\'s no menu, no waiting list.  And you will only get a seat if she likes you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (on camera):  Oh, I ordered too much.  Sorry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh that\\'s -- it\\'s fantastic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I was trying to get all my...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, I\\'m very happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  We\\'re joined by Minji\\'s (ph) friends, Hu Jing (ph), an artist, and Mathew Lei (ph), a restaurateur.\\n\\n(on camera): This looks fantastic.  How do you eat this?  Whole?\\n\\nMINJI (ph):  I eat them whole because I really like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That was...\\n\\nMINJI (ph): Good, yeah?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh they\\'re good.\\n\\nMINJI (ph):  I think they cook it, you know, few seconds.  That\\'s the secret...\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You bao he xia are tiny shrimp, deep fried first and then quickly tossed in the wok with garlic, ginger, salt, and soy.  What is classic Shanghainese food?  What\\'s distinctive about it?  Well, this for instance, it\\'s often black or dark and heavily inflicted with oil, soy, and sugar.\\n\\nShanghai is and has been for some time, a city if immigrants.  And the food reflects that genealogy.  A combination of people from neighboring Zhejiang province known for their liberally use of sugar, soy and vinegar, and from Jiangsu Province known for fresh ingredients in attention to preserving the aliveness of its dishes.  It\\'s the best of both of worlds, great sauces, great ingredients.\\n\\nThere\\'s hong shao rou, braised pork belly in a deep red braise of dark and light soy sauce, cinnamon, sugar, and anise.\\n\\nHon jia chan yu (ph), a small fish poached first in rice wine, salt and light soy, then fried in ginger, garlic, oil or soy and sugar until the liquid\\'s reduced to a gorgeous, sticky sauce.\\n\\nJion ya (ph), duck that\\'s been marinated, blanched, then reheated, smothered in a sauce made from the reduced drippings lift in the wok with dark soy, salt, and sugar.\\n\\nAnd this to round things up, yandi xian, a clay pot soup of bean curd base stalk with salted pork belly, tofu ribbons, and bamboo shoots.\\n\\n(on camera): Oh, the flavor.  This is a socialist country, supposedly.\\n\\nMINJI:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was a communist country, supposedly.  It is in fact from real (ph) evidence that I\\'ve ever seen, the most dynamic country on earth.  What do you think about that?\\n\\nMINJI (ph):  I think a lot of my western friends come here thinking China is past immersion (ph) of non-career or the party (ph) can chose everything.  But they come here, they\\'re surprised.  It\\'s actually not that much.  They do seem to be promoting the free market even more with the free trade zone just established in Shanghai.  So, it\\'s amazing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  From what I see everywhere I go, the world is becoming more Chinese.  Chinese influence, Chinese food.  If you\\'ve build a casino in Vegas or a hotel in Singapore, you have to consider what will the Chinese think.  Is that exciting? MINJI (ph):  It\\'s exciting that we finally have a (inaudible) that we wouldn\\'t, but China is full of -- in the spotlight, in the center of the stage now that we wouldn\\'t have dream though of like, say, only a decade ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For me, I think, you know, the communist menace that we use to always talk about in America, I think the most terrifying scenario is that China becomes a completely free market, non-socialist, non- communist society, because you\\'d bury us.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I love few things more than quoting that impeccable communist, Dang Xiaopeng, \"To be rich is glorious.\"  All - isms are -wasms, (ph), dig deep and it\\'s always about the money.\\n\\nMeet Tim Tse, a resident of Communist China, a man of impeccable taste.  One of more than a 150,000 Shanghainese billionaires accustomed to the good life.\\n\\nTIM TSE, PRESIDENT, ROOSEVELT CHINA INVESTMENTS (on camera):  We take the seawater out, replace with champagne.  We can have it all at once, hopefully you like it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  He likes nice things and he makes Donald Trump\\'s garnished (ph), ticky-tacky empire look like the back of Pauly D\\'s (ph) van .\\n\\n(on camera): Where this from?  They\\'re great.\\n\\nTSE  France.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  France, fantastic.  Wow, they were in good shape.\\n\\nTSE  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was good.\\n\\nTSE  We treat them happy.  Every single one is flying from jet with (inaudible) belt so they were nice and happy and safe/\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Apparently.\\n\\n(voice-over)  Tim is an investor into real estate, telecoms, and the newly expanding service industries of the new China.  He\\'s also the president of Roosevelt China Investments, a very old company with a long history doing business here, created by the Roosevelt family, maybe you\\'ve heard of them.\\n\\nThis is his clubhouse, really.  The house of Roosevelt on the Bund, right in the middle of it all.  Wine is big here now, the French chateaus, more and more they looked at China as the indicators of price, as the market maker.  Tim alone stocked around 4,000 labels here.  China in general bought 2 billion bottles of red wine last year alone.  Think about that for a minute, they are now the leading market for red wine in the world.  (on camera): It\\'s pretty amazing here.\\n\\nTSE:  Well, I designed this place in five minutes.  I look at this place for like six months, day time, night time, and finally (inaudible) interesting, I\\'m going to make a wine cellar will out of this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look so good.\\n\\nTSE:  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ice?  Well, this is nice.\\n\\n(voice-over): Tim has invited me to dinner alongside a few people that have taken full advantage of the blooming economy in China.  Ms. Ida Wang (ph), an architect and designer, Daniel Jang (ph), a real estate developer, and Coco Shu, a party planner.\\n\\n(on camera):  So you eat like this all the time?  Nice wine cellar...\\n\\nTSE:  Twice at night.  Today, we\\'re surrounded by Southern French wine and (inaudible) wines.  And if you like here, you can eat in different district of wine country every night.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Isn\\'t this supposed to be Communist China?  I mean it seems like it was very...\\n\\nTSE:  Can I ask a question?  Does anyone of our communist party comrades party member?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, no, I\\'m kidding.  I\\'m a bit of a red diaper baby but -- what I mean to say is it just seems that the realm of the possible here is very big.\\n\\nDANIEL JANG (ph):  Absolutely.  It\\'s a big stage.  I mean, in New York City or in other places in the world, you can see that you may build a massive project, but that\\'s probably the only one in the whole city. But in Shanghai, there\\'s ten (ph) of market projects going on, and if there\\'s ten (ph), more is coming up in the next couple of years.\\n\\nTSE:  You know, it is a big world, big city but a small village in the end.  And I think food is the best weapon on earth to make peace, it\\'s the food (inaudible) have better peace on earth.  And you\\'ll probably the United Nation Ambassador.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In time.\\n\\nTSE:  And this little shrimps are from South Pole, and only New Zealand has a way to find them.  Try it with your wasabi if you like.\\n\\nCOCO SHU:  A lot of Chinese restaurant in New York.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I grew up in the 50\\'s and the 60\\'s and even then, Chinese restaurant, Chinese food was really an essential part of being a New Yorker, I mean if you didn\\'t know how to use chopsticks as a New Yorker, you are a terrible New Yorker.  TSE:  You know, I want to ask something, do you know how to speak like\\n\\na Brooklyn president?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a tough accent.  Queens is easier, you know, it\\'s a more of a -- I can\\'t, I mean, I lived right next to it my whole life.\\n\\nTSE:  Can you say...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What I mean the accent.\\n\\nTSE:  We don\\'t want to hear...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A Brooklyn expression.\\n\\nTSE:  I just want to hear...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for nothing.\\n\\nTSE:  What?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for nothing.\\n\\nTSE:  Is that best Brook (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for nothing.\\n\\nTSE:  Best for nothing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for nothing, but, you know, I can really use a little more wine.\\n\\nTSE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for nothing, not at all.\\n\\nTSE:  Not for nothing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for nothing\\n\\nTSE:  Not for nothing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not for -- all right.\\n\\nTSE:  Shanghai Chef Jacky Shu (ph) prepares a meal of a style that will become without a doubt, more and more typical and in demand here among those who can afford it.  And more and more people everyday can afford it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is it?\\n\\nTSE:  So we have tomato and potato and that\\'s it.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over):  Australian Wagyu beef.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Nice.\\n\\n(voice over):  A massive perfectly cook tomahawk chop.  Coming in the door at up to $150 a pound that includes bones and fat, this is about a thousand dollars worth of steak bitches (ph).\\n\\nEven if Tim wanted a serve good all USA beef still the finest on earth in my opinion.  He can\\'t.  China has banned imports of US beef over concerns about mad cow disease.\\n\\nWhile they (inaudible), the quick trip behind the bookshelves.\\n\\nTSE:  And I want to show you a special place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nTSE:  So you named your labels, the village of wines, I think most of the chance we have it.\\n\\nAnd, so these sizes and so I will interesting wine that against (inaudible) Asian themselves.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is the house collection.\\n\\nTSE:  That\\'s correct.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTSE:  And I want to show you the membership area to our newest members Anthony Bourdain.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s also about (inaudible) about collection of wines, please open it\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, cool.  It\\'s good being me.  Thank you.\\n\\nTSE:  It\\'s good to having you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you so much.\\n\\nWe will close that up now, wait a minute.\\n\\nTSE:  Close it up.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Here\\'s the thing, even with the modern China rising out of the ground all around you even with all the things to save things you see for sale everywhere where people have these days. Even with all lack, there still this China.  Shouning Road, just south of people\\'s square.  It\\'s still happening.  The good old stuff.\\n\\nThe China you first fell in love with walked down the street and look at any direction and there\\'s something eat.  I mean, I don\\'t know what it is immediately, but chances are, it\\'s good.\\n\\nWe talk about foodies (ph) and what the hell does that mean?  By current definition, best I can understand that makes just about every Chinese person I ever laid eyes on, the foody (ph).  Which is too say, a perfectly amusable person who enjoys and pays attention to where the good stuff is.\\n\\nLook at this, one street, and look, stuffed oysters grilled over charcoal.   Snake treat, oh yes, and yes, it does taste kind of like chicken.\\n\\nIt used to be a lot of streets like this, full of dai pai dong where you could look, shop around, and eat all out in the open.  Happy, righteous (ph), delicious torrent (ph) of food, but the government as governments do, are tightening the screws.  Old is bad, new is good.\\n\\nNot everybody thinks this is a good idea though.  Bill Wang was born in Shang and studied here at Tongji Universit.  He began teaching English before he was out of college.  He suggested me neither for a wonton and there are maybe wonton stalls all over Shanghai, but Bill says this one, this one is the one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  So you\\'re an English teacher.\\n\\nBILL WANG, ENGLISH TEACHER:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Most of it -- I mean, a Chinese background who speak English how their teachers were British, sometimes Australian or New Zealand and they have those expressions on that accent.\\n\\nWe need more and more of these days, I guess younger generation is more and more about sort of TV accent.  Is that good or bad?\\n\\nWANG:  I think it\\'s good, you know, TV series, especially American TV series already are so popular in China.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are the most popular American shows in China?\\n\\nWANG:  Right now, House of Cards.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  House of Cards.\\n\\nWANG:  Yeah, so popular.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  House of cards.\\n\\nWANG:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s really interesting.  Why do you think you appeal (ph) this year?\\n\\nWANG:  You know, in the show, you know, American didn\\'t talk about president.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  In China, there\\'s no way you can\\'t about those sense the day of topics.  So maybe (inaudible) love that show, it\\'s really, really good. BOURDAIN:  Wow.  That\\'s really...\\n\\n(OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... a surprise to me.  Wow, these are huge.\\n\\nWANG:  Yes.  Wonton.\\n\\n(OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.\\n\\nWANG:  Is it good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Minced pork, bok choy, some ginger, moistened with rice wine, soy.  It all gets mixed up nicely and folded into the dough.  Boiled till just right and sauce with a powerful mixed of soy sauce, vinegar, chili sauce, sesame oil and peanut butter.\\n\\nSo you kind of sweet savory, acidy, salty, spicy umami (ph) thing going on with every bite, you want this, believe me.  You want this bad, in fact, you mean it.\\n\\n(on-camera):  What do your students want to do when they enter the professional field?  What\\'s the dream?\\n\\nWANG:  I think this generation, they are a lot of them are lost.  They don\\'t know that to do.  If you ask like a university or what is their dream?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  (inaudible) is to buy an apartment, (inaudible), buy car, you know, that kinds of things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there enough jobs for everybody?\\n\\nWANG:  This is becoming more and more competitive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  And what he wants the best job but it\\'s only very few of them among there.  But I think there\\'s like a huge gap between company and new graduates.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  Company wants to experience the workers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  We need graduates also want a good job.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now?\\n\\nWANG:  Yes, now.  They are not ready for it. BOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  So they don\\'t want to do some, you know, hard work, start from scratch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  So that\\'s the problem against.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It looks to me, Chinese in general, Shanghai is particular is changing very, very fast (ph).\\n\\nWANG:  Very, very wild (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every time I come it\\'s different.  And in your reason, I mean last 10 years, what the most noticeable change to you?\\n\\nWANG:  Food like this is becoming more and more difficult to find. This is hand made, I think it\\'s a real food is not very expensive and taste great, but a lot of food, you know, pasta is good right now.\\n\\nAnd also, of course, it\\'s (inaudible), it has suppose in (inaudible), the good part is that you can get information (inaudible)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nWANG:  The bad part is that people don\\'t talk to each other even like to look good or restaurant, you know, like a couple, it\\'s all pictures.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, right.\\n\\nWANG:  And uses cellphones and then talk to each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re communicating with everybody else in the world about who\\'s at the table.\\n\\nWANG:  They enjoy their life or what\\'s point, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It didn\\'t happened until you Twitted it as we say.\\n\\nWANG:  Oh my, God.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What\\'s clear very quickly here is the way China claims things are that way things is supposed to be as far as permissible social media at access information and the way actually are, two different things.\\n\\nMeet Thomas Yao, hacker turned entrepreneur.  He recently receives significant start up money to build what he calls an open source project sharing platform to connect Chinese college students with the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  And when you say hacking, what is -- what do you do when you hack?  What is the intent?\\n\\nTHOMAS YAO, HACKER, ENTREPRENEUR:  Actually it\\'s start from IMG (ph), if you go to the computer science and entrepreneur intelligence during the IMG (ph), it will show you the definition of hack.  It\\'s actually a very positive one but it\\'s pertaining the very negative words.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYAO:  Sort of one hacker is to describe the people who are really -- they really like programming as -- say, the love to share information. It\\'s just like cooking.  You love to share recipes to other friends for live cooking and well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Legally, there might be something one is it, but morally, you think there\\'s anything wrong with like, but you\\'re essentially breaking into an information based.\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not doing anything.\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I want to go in, I\\'m going to look around, I\\'m going to see how things work and I\\'ll leave without disturbing anything.\\n\\nWith most hackers, say that\\'s OK.\\n\\nYAO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s in the service of knowledge that\\'s...\\n\\nYAO:  It\\'s OK for most of the hackers.  Our communities -- I was so lucky, I got even you a very big, big hacker of community here in China and (inaudible) great mentors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Started in this (inaudible) this 21.\\n\\nYAO:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Great (inaudible).\\n\\nYAO:  I didn\\'t go to college.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You didn\\'t go to college?\\n\\nYAO:  I didn\\'t go to college.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not?\\n\\nYAO:  Most of professor (inaudible) behinds the (inaudible) speed of the communities.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?\\n\\nYAO:  Because... BOURDAIN:  You\\'re -- the country is so advanced in so many other ways. Why in this area?\\n\\nYAO:  And that\\'s more problems here in China.  We have (inaudible) a great firework, and it\\'s (inaudible) unpleasant information websites. This is our China, and a lot of people they call against the (inaudible) technology...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYAO:  ... which we don\\'t teach in college at all.  So the human resource problem in (inaudible) getting more and more serious here in China.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Because everyone is going to Silicon Valley.\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah, all for better, obviously.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYAO:  All, (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are these the famous ribs?\\n\\nYAO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Maybe the number thing that the seriously food craze traveler coming back from Shanghai will tell you to eat other than the soup dumplings of course, ziran paigu or simply cumin ribs.\\n\\nIt takes two cooks working at once to make this dish, one deep fries the ribs in hot oil until just right.  Another toast the ginger and other spices in a wok, and then in go the ribs.  (inaudible) what\\'s called (inaudible) close to the kitchen as possible.\\n\\nTo capture that elusive (inaudible) dissipating breathe flavor of the wok itself.\\n\\nToss it around, coating those bones with all that good stuff then serve.\\n\\nAnd because we like to burn, Thomas orders some (inaudible) a spicy chicken dish.\\n\\nHei (ph) means energy, bite force or breath.  And that\\'s what you\\'re looking for, the (inaudible) flavor the essence of a very old carefully seasoned cooking vessel.\\n\\nOddly enough, Thomas (ph) tells me there\\'s no Mandarin or at least Shanghainese word for wok.  It\\'s simply called a cooking pot.  To which I say I really do know nothing about this country.\\n\\n(on camera):  Wow, fantastic.  Wow.\\n\\nYAO:  It\\'s (inaudible) also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes?  No, you\\'re not loving that?\\n\\nYAO:  Muscle, not too good, but it\\'s not bad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To me -- and I\\'ve eaten a lot of food, but this is spicy, fresh, great, vibrant.\\n\\nYAO:  After this, I will take you guys to somewhere -- I will take you somewhere better.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, are you a foodie?\\n\\nYAO:  Yes, I eat a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Were you born here, you\\'re from Shanghai?\\n\\nYAO:  Yes, I was born and raised in Shanghai.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At least in modern times, it\\'s hard to imagine that any place has changed as profoundly and is changing as quickly as it is changing here.\\n\\nYAO:  Where there\\'s no problem.  Our quality of life is improving really, really faster.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With a poll of 85 percent of Chinese who are asked the question, \"Do you feel that your life will be better next year,\" 85 percent said, \"Yes, it will be better next year.\"  This is an extraordinary--\\n\\nYAO:  Number.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Number.  I don\\'t know a lot of other countries that would say that.\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, that looks great.  The famous--\\n\\nYAO:  That\\'s chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chicken.  It\\'s so good.\\n\\nYAO:  Not bad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, I\\'m finding this food really, really delicious. And you\\'re saying it\\'s just--\\n\\nYAO:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m finding it wow.  Yeah.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Shanghai is one of the biggest cities in the world right now, a global financial center in transportation hub and the world\\'s busiest port.  You can smell the money.  But maybe the real story is the newly emerging participants in global capitalism. The middle class, the working class, who also want flat screen TVs and cars and vacations and the promise of better for their kids.\\n\\nTake this couple, typical working-class Chinese from the worker\\'s paradise, Mei-ming (ph), a bus driver, and Dong Yeon Yang (ph), his bride to be.  Today is their wedding day and custom must be observed. When it comes to weddings, the Chinese have always gone big, and these days, bigger still, lots of food, lots of booze, lots of people getting crazy.  That\\'s why Thomas (ph) and I have become wedding crashers.  The Constellation bar for a pre-wedding drink, the classic Chinese cocktail, the Moscow Mule -- OK, maybe not Chinese.\\n\\n(on camera):  This are good.\\n\\nYAO:  Yes.  This is the reason why I love this place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you married?\\n\\nYAO:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, not yet.\\n\\nYAO:  I\\'m not a big fan of marriage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve been to weddings, yes?\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you ever crashed a wedding before?\\n\\nYAO:  No.\\n\\nBOUDAIN:  It\\'s going to be a little weird.  I mean we don\\'t know anybody there.\\n\\n(voice-over):  How do you do?\\n\\n(on camera):  Well, I hope the food\\'s good at this thing.  They probably have a lot of drinks.\\n\\nYAO:  It\\'s going to be really crazy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well.\\n\\nYAO:  We drink a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  So, ready to crash a wedding?\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah, let\\'s do it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nYAO:  Cheers.  We can go across around here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The Chinese wedding is not cheap.  You need a banquet room.  In this case, the families rented out this place, the historic Park Hotel, Shanghai.  Chinese weddings, generally speaking, mean the presence of a number of formalities.  First, meet the bride and groom upon entering.  Red envelope, also known as the hongbao, like in good fellows, it\\'s a little something for the bride and groom to help them get started in their new life.\\n\\n(on camera):  Thank you.  It\\'s awesome.\\n\\n(voice-over):  OK.  Table setting, often with some must-have\\'s present, booze, whiskey, smokes for the guests.\\n\\nYAO:  This is (inaudible) like our traditional Chinese wedding.  They will rent a hotel and--\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I know.  I do this every week.  I go from hotel to hotel and I crash weddings.\\n\\nYAO:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Roast duck, that, I will have.  Of course with some (foreign language) or beef tripe in garlic sauce, Kona crab shelled and then sauted in garlic and ginger before being stuffed back into the shell, steamed turbot with scallots.\\n\\nYAO:  Weddings in China, so just kind of meal for whole two days, whole weekend.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So tell me, we should do this every week.  I\\'ll come back, I\\'m going to move to Shanghai.  And you and me, twice a week, we\\'ll just go to weddings.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).\\n\\nYAO:  They\\'ll make it so bright.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).\\n\\nYAO:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And there is of course drinking, much drinking.\\n\\n(on camera):  When I first came to China, it\\'s for business.  And one after the other, everyone at the table came up and said, \"Oh, Mr. Bourdain, I would like to do a drink with you,\" and they -- all of it. I didn\\'t know how to politely say no.  I can\\'t.  I just kept doing it and doing it and it\\'s super.  I ended up going like the karaoke.  I ended up singing Billy Idol songs.  I think I sang, \"White Wedding.\"\\n\\nYou\\'re making the personal issue--\\n\\nYAO:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- and seriously.  I\\'m just wondering how you got out of that.  When I sat down and I looked around the table and I find that, \"OK, who at this table is going to try really hard to get me drunk,\" I wouldn\\'t have guessed it was going to be her.\\n\\nYAO:  They\\'re drinking this white wine all day long.  I can drink a lot but I will just more likely to taste all day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look, we have to get this straight.  That is not wine. That\\'s like grain alcohol.  That\\'s what we call liquor.\\n\\nYAO:  Yes, something like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, at least we\\'re clear on that.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Now, this is a small wedding by most standards, about 100 guests.  But just booking the room took two years.  A toast followed by many more toasts to the bride, to the groom, to happiness, to prosperity.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There is a place, there is always a place where something delicious in a bowl is waiting just for your.  Down a street, down an alley, there\\'s a place like this one where locals would tell you the good stuff list.\\n\\nThey call this stuff long-leg noodles, because they say the woman who runs it is tall.  Noodles for me are a solitary pleasure between me and my bowl.  Fen Li (ph) and her husband, Chi Fon Wang (ph), understand this I think.  Now, this is a deceptively good business. What used to be a typical, low-cost, working class stall of the Dai Pai Dong\\'s meat variety has in fact blown up along with the rest of the economy.\\n\\nRich kids or TV guys like me want to eat here, and they do.  How do you make a bowl of perfect happiness?  Cook noodles in boiling water, liberally flavored with chilies and lard.  A mercier (ph) cooked noodles at a soy inflicted bath of deeply sinister, deeply pleasurable pork stock.  A little bit of baby bok choy, heat for a few seconds, simmering, simmering, then garnished with a bit of slowly cooked, heavily reduced, almost candy pork.  Then suck those noodles loudly and enjoy.\\n\\nWhere are we going?  Who will drive us there?  What will it be like when we get there?  I think it will look like this.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This house came to be built by Dr. Blake (ph), who was in the Eastern (inaudible).\\n\\nMy grandfather came to be nominated to the council of state, which used to be part of British India.\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\":  It was another time, one that few still remember, the India before partition, when these rooms, this house, was part of the seat of power.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I had the privilege of being born in this house upstairs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This was the maharajah\\'s bed.  I mean, his chambers are present.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And it was the routine that we\\'d all (inaudible) into my grandfather\\'s room to wish him good morning, and then we would all come down to breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The walls tell a story, many stories.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There used to be a lot of animosity.  There were two very divided classes in India.  So there was a lot of tension between the ruled and the rulers.  But that was a different time, you know.  Now I think back, and it\\'s more like a fairy tale.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Day one in northern India near the Pakistan border.  This is Amritsar, the Indian Punjab\\'s largest city, population, about a million.  This is a part of India I have never seen, a place I have always been curious about, home to some pretty legendary cuisine.  They have a saying, \"The best food isn\\'t cooked in people\\'s homes.  You find it on the streets.\"\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Punjabis are known for their adventurous spirit as brave warriors who spread throughout the world bringing great food with them.  In fact, much of the good stuff we refer to simply as Indian food comes from here.  The Punjab of the early 20th century saw some of the most violent\\n\\nresistance to British rule.  And when the British finally cashed out in 1947, they carved off a huge piece, what is now Pakistan.  And it remains a potential flash point for conflict.  But that\\'s easy to forget when you first smell the food.\\n\\n(on-camera):  There we go.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Kesar da dhaba meaning side of the road food stall. And there are countless dhabas to choose from in this town, but this one is legendary.\\n\\n(on-camera):  See Tony eat vegetables and like it.\\n\\n(voice-over):  To eat around this part of the world, Punjab in particular, get used to eating a lot of vegetarian: chickpeas, dought (ph).\\n\\nIndia is one of the few places on earth where even for me, that\\'s not a burden.\\n\\n(on-camera):  What\\'s that?  Oh, I\\'ll take that.  Right here, my good man.  Mm.  That\\'s good.\\n\\n(voice-over):  In the Punjab, meat or no meat, you are almost guaranteed a free for all of intense colors, flavors and spices.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Unlike some of the joyless vegetarian restaurants in my sad experience, vegetables here are actually spicy, all taste different, different textures and served with extraordinarily good bread.  It\\'s got this multi-tiered crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle.  It\\'s a whole different experience.\\n\\n(voice-over):  If this was what vegetarianism meant in most of the places that practice it in the West, I would be at least half as much less of a dick about the subject.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Look, hippie, if you made bread this good, I might eat in your restaurant.  Mm.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Around here, one of the first things you notice that\\'s different from the rest of India, turbans, everywhere, the symbol of self-respect, bravery and spirituality for Sikh men.  Amritsar is the home, the spiritual center of the Sikh faith, the world\\'s fifth largest and maybe most misunderstood religion.\\n\\nIn the heart of Amritsar stands the majestic Golden Temple, the Sikh equivalent of the Vatican.  Sikhs are fundamentally against any caste system, believers in religious tolerance, but they are just as fundamentally war-like when it comes to defending their principles and what they see as their territory.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to Golden Temple.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Thank you.  (voice-over):  Today is a Gurpurb, one of the most auspicious days of\\n\\nthe Sikh calendar.  Pilgrims from all over the world come to worship, walk the perimeter and bathe in the holy pool.  All are welcome of any faith or caste to remove their shoes, wash their feet, cover their heads, and take part in a simple meal.  This is the longer (ph), a free vegetarian meal served to many thousands of visitors from every walk of life every day of the year.\\n\\n(on-camera):  They serve 16 hours a day?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sixteen hour a day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: For how many years, continuously?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  300 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  300 years.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Everyone doing the cooking, the serving, the washing of thousands and thousands of metal plates and utensils are volunteers. The sound is extraordinary.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a feeling that everyone should all three things: money, mind and body --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- should be served to other people free of cost. And that\\'s what we do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Walking me through it all today, Donwai Sing (ph).\\n\\n(on-camera):  Now, for a religion that\\'s so concerned with tolerance, where does the Grand Punjab military tradition come from?  Because it\\'s a very, very powerful (inaudible).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So powerful people, so hard-working people.  Every Sikh you have seen, if he is baptized, he wears a small sword.  When we are baptized, he says you must protect yourself.  You must protect others, and you must protect your country, so that makes us what we are.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The ancient art of Pehlwani evolved from Indian wrestling techniques that date back to the fifth century B.C.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ready, start!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Training is rigid, and this is not just a sport, but a way of life.  Wrestlers live and train together and have strict rules of diet and personal conduct.  No smoking, no drinking, no contact with women.  (on-camera):  I took high school wrestling, actually, so that I could\\n\\nget out of gym class.  I was a dirty, dirty fighter.\\n\\n(voice-over):  It\\'s an all too natural segue between the aggressive posturing of opposing bodies of  Pehlwani and this.  The entire border between India and Pakistan has only one crossing, here.  Every sunset the border is officially closed with this bit of national theater. Wearing nearly duplicate uniforms, the Indian military and Pakistani rangers partake in a game of theatrical contempt.  Clearly, it\\'s a popular show.\\n\\n(on-camera):  So where are we?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are right next to Pakistan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  India and Pakistan were once one country, ripped apart in one of the hastiest, ill-considered partitions imaginable.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Beyond there, no more fence?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No more fences.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So once you get past there, you can go straight into Pakistan if you want?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The problem is, the thing is, India is trying to stop people from coming in, the infiltrators, you know, drug dealers, terrorists.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Udah (ph) is working on a documentary about the India/Pakistan border.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No one wants to go to Pakistan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No one wants to?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No one wants to, in their right mind, to go into Pakistan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  That\\'s a fairly decisive statement.  So they put up the fence, but the fence is on the Indian side.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, it\\'s 115 meters from the border.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, so beyond that fence, still Indian farmland.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So people who live over here can farm over there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Farm over there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The Punjab is a fertile region in an otherwise very dry country.  This is India\\'s bread basket.  With over a billion people currently residing in India, every inch of fertile Punjabi soil has great value.\\n\\n(on-camera):  These are people who owned land over there, then they put the fence, suddenly your life became difficult.\\n\\nUNIDNETIFIED MALE: Exactly.  They (inaudible).  They can only grow some kind of crops, and they can\\'t farm more than eight hours in a day.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long does it take to get back and forth?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The border security force manage these gates, so they have times when they can enter and come out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How much farther can we go before they start to get worried?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think we can just go to the pole.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  When India and Pakistan were separated, the attempt was to try to draw a line across religious lines.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Drained by the colossal task of fighting two world wars, in 1947 Great Britain decided to end their nearly 200-year rule over India.  In an attempt to prevent what the colonials saw as an inevitable civil war between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, the British commissioner Sir. Cyril Radcliffe, a lawyer from Wales, drew up a new border.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He was given two months.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Two months to --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two months to divide the --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To create a new country, basically.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, people died because of the displaced men.  Unofficially, they say it\\'s two million people.  You know, when (inaudible) fight, the minnows get trampled upon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In one of the largest exchanges of populations in history, many millions of people fled their homes.  Almost immediately, religious violence broke out on a mass scale.  This is exactly what the partition had been intended to avoid.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Do people here still have families over there?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, they do.  When the line was drawn, there were religious split into halves.  There are some houses where you enter from India and you exit from Pakistan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really.  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This part of Punjab and that part of Punjab, they were once the same, so the cultures are very similar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, it\\'s a popular metaphor for India.  Pakistan is twins separated at birth.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They were never twins.  I mean, it was one country.  You could say dismembered.  If you cut a body in two, they are not going to become twins.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s sad, you know?  You -- you can see them. They are doing the same work as you are doing.  They dress the same. They look the same.  But you can\\'t talk to them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is an ongoing struggle, an enduring cause of paranoia, visible all across the region.  Two nations with atomic arsenals who have shown, if nothing else, a terrifying willingness to use them.\\n\\nFrom the horrific 2006 train bombings, to the militant attacks in Mumbai, the threat of terrorism along this border is a daily concern.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over)  Want something good, really, really good, something local, regional, ironically wonderful?  You can\\'t say you\\'ve had the Amritsar experience until you\\'ve had a little kulcha in your life.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Kulcha, this is the iconic dish of Punjab.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, that\\'s the specialty here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:   Kulcha, a perfect little flavor bomb of wheat dough pressed against the side of a very, very hot clay oven, slathered with butter and served with a spicy chickpea curry on the side.  Did I mention the butter?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How is it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Delicious.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Everyone in Amritsar seems to be an expert on the dish, including this lady.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is our radish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Very, very, very good.  Generally speaking, Punjabis are famous for being a warrior class.  Taller, bigger.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  They\\'re big.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still maybe not fighters so much, but still eaters.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, yes.  Big-time.  Yes.  The religion doesn\\'t matter.  Food is religion here.  BOURDAIN (voice-over):  Checking off my list of things to do in the\\n\\nPunjab, I got to score some animal protein.  It\\'s time.  I\\'ve been going all morrissey (ph) for two days now and frankly, that\\'s enough. I need chicken.\\n\\n(on-camera): Like, we are in the ass-end (ph) of nowhere here.  Where am I?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s (inaudible).  That\\'s very famous for chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When we are talking must-haves, tandori chicken is just that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have some lemon in this.  You will enjoy it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Oh, man, it\\'s delicious.  This type of establishment, dhaba?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dhaba, it\\'s called abaha (ph).  This is the most successful business here.  Anybody -- you open a dhaba tomorrow, it will be like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But if you\\'re -- you know, if you\\'re going to have chicken it better be good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  (inaudible) good place for that.  Would you like to have something else?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s, like, a rotee (ph) with ground mutton or --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Kinemon, mutton ball, dough.  And the special ingredient, magic hands.  And believe me when I tell you, this shit is good.  So good that people snap it up the second it comes out of the tandora.  Hey, that\\'s mine.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is it good?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  Sensational.  Wow.  People do love their food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I love eating.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The movies and television in this country is fantastic.  I don\\'t even understand why -- what\\'s going on.  I mean, everybody dances and sings.  I don\\'t get it.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Would you like to have something else?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, this is good.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.\\n\\nMm, that\\'s good.  Thank you.  No, nothing, thank you.  Delicious.  So good.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice over): Leaving the fertile plains of the Punjab behind, I\\'m headed out towards the Himalayas.  In getting there, at least the way I\\'m going, hasn\\'t changed much in the last hundred years.  All aboard.\\n\\n(on camera):  This is going to be suboptimal seating.  I don\\'t think this reclines.  Thank god they have relaxed attitudes towards prescription drugs.  Before you enter the gateway to the Himalayas, you better self-medicate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I have been like 24 hours without a bite of food.  I arrive, it\\'s like oh, there\\'s snackks on the way.  Great.  Get a bag of peanuts.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Truth be told, I\\'m an angry bitter man when I board. I\\'m guessing there ain\\'t a Shoanie\\'s (ph) or a P.F. Chang on the way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So little.  The universal tourist.  You go on the King Kong ride.\\n\\n(voice-over):  While my stomach growls, I become the kind of traveler I warn against -- gripey, self-absorbed, immune to my surroundings. But as my brightly colored little train heads up into the hills from Kalka Station, known as the gateway to the Himalayas, my world view starts to improve.\\n\\nThe unnaturally bright colors of India start to pleasurably saturate my brain.  The views from the window of ridiculously deep valleys, hundred-year-old bridges, it\\'s, well, breath-taking.  My fellow passengers, too, are irresistibly charming.  The school kids in their uniforms cheer in unison every time we pass through one of the tunnels.\\n\\nCHILDREN:  Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I had pretty much forgotten about my hunger until the whistle stopped at Barog.\\n\\n(on camera):  Could I have one of those and two of these.\\n\\n(voice-over):  This place is named for a Colonel Barog, the British engineer tasked with building the line up to Shimla.  The station and the adjacent tunnel bearing his name are rumored to be haunted.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s delicious.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Already behind schedule and plagued by cost overruns, Barog screwed up.  When he realized the two ends of this tunnel didn\\'t meet in the middle, he shot himself.  It\\'s the kind of personal accountability I would like to see more of, frankly.  Or is that just me?  But all my snarkiness fades as one can\\'t help but reflect on what it took to dig, drag, blast and tunnel one\\'s way up this route back in the day.  Back in the beginning, making the trip to Shimla required a somewhat\\n\\nuncomfortable three-day trek up the mountain by foot or horse or hand- carried palanquin.  The stats are impressive.  The climb of around 5,000 feet, over 100 tunnels, more than 800 bridges, an engineering feat, a job that when you consider the time, defies imagining.\\n\\nIn the building of this railroad, many died.  Many, many died.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When you look at that painting, when you stand out front of the garden and look out at the view, can you picture the way it was?\\n\\nRATANJIT SINGH:  I have been to many places where it reminded me of what Shimla would have been when the British first came and settled there.  I have ventured to such places.  It is the time that we\\'re from, like I\\'m feeling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Fond memories of British rule?  Maybe not what you would expect to hear.  But Kohwar (ph) Ratanjit Singh, that\\'s Reggie for short, his family was different.  Indian royalty with palaces, the 1 percent of the 1 percent.  So life for Reggie as a young boy was, relative to the millions and millions of others his age, enchanted.\\n\\nShimla is from a time before partition, when nearly the entire ruling class of British India would move to hill stations in the hotter months.  Shimla was once known as the queen of all hill stations. Here, the colonials created England in miniature complete with Tudor architecture, rose gardens, afternoon tea.\\n\\nSINGH:  My grandfather, it\\'s very difficult to decide what did you do? Well, quite frankly, he did nothing.  He entertained hugely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Garden parties, fancy dress balls, elephant hunts.  The remnants of British rule can still be seen and felt.  This is particularly true of one house -- Chapslee.\\n\\nSINGH:  My family was very fortunate that they were able to buy this house, because it was a famous house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The house was purchased by Reggie\\'s grandfather, the last maharajah of Kapurthala.\\n\\n(on camera):  The Brits really left beautiful buildings.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  From a distance, it looks much the same as it must have when the maharajah slept here.\\n\\n(on camera):  Check out the tub.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Locked in a constant battle against time and nature, barbed wire does little to keep Shimla\\'s ever encroaching monkey population at bay.\\n\\nStripped of their wealth and their kingdoms, the one-time royals all across India have had to either sell their estates or, like Reggie, turn them into hotels and guest houses in order to hold on.  Ring a buzzer and a servant appears.\\n\\n(on camera):  They bring you hot water bottles at night, put them under the covers.  Butlers keep popping in, build a nice fire.\\n\\nSINGH:  A great facet of my childhood was how my grandfather entertained.  His table came to be known as perhaps the most famous in northern India because he was a connoisseur of food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tonight, dinner at Chapslee, an elaborate Anglo-Indian menu from Reggie\\'s childhood.\\n\\nSINGH:  I will put on my apron first.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My fellow guests, two of Reggie\\'s friends, Raja Bathil (ph), a historian on the subject of Shimla, and Rakash Barlosou (ph), the barrister.\\n\\n(on camera):  So much history here.  While I take a dim view of colonialization, it\\'s very hard to resist the charms of a house like this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s quite understandable, actually.  You\\'ve got 100 years of very, very intense history funneled into a very small place.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This house used to house the secretary of state.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What am I eating?  This is Eggs Florentine.\\n\\nOh, that\\'s good.\\n\\nThis was a small town?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Small town with a very, very big government.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Shimla enjoys the unique distinction of having been the summer capital of India and, surprisingly, it was the capital of Burma during the war days.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So here you have this tiny little village up on the hill connected to the rest of the world by a narrow mountain path and a rule, approximately a fifth of the human race for eight months every year.  In today\\'s context it would almost seem bizarre.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mulligatawny soup.  A classic example of what we think of as Indian food in the west but not at all.  This was originally a soup made by Indian chefs to accommodate British tastes, is that correct?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was something what you would call halfway between a  regular dar (ph), a lentil, which you would eat and a broth.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mutton glace chops.  Basically, meat cooked in its own fat and it would have a lot of curry on it.  It\\'s a misnomer. This meat is not actually mutton.  It is chevron (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Here, back before the rail line, it would be a difficult trip.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But once they were up and running, there were many servants to look after your every need.  You had a fireplace, a hearth in every room.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And people on the regular payroll whose only job was to shoo monkeys off the droughts (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'d be carried around in palanquins, a little box in which you sat, a curtained box.  And this man would go (inaudible) on the ground and the common folk would give way.  And normally they would not supposed to look in the direction.  It was bad manners.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It wasn\\'t easy for the people who built the town. It was India that paid the bill for all this grandeur, for all this pomp, for all this show.  They did it at our expense and with our money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over0:  At the end of the meal, there\\'s coffee, brandy and cigars in the sitting room -- as one does, or once did.\\n\\nSINGH:  I hope you enjoyed your dinner too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh ,very much.  It was delicious.  Really wonderful.  A lot of history in this house.\\n\\n(voice-over):  And one can be forgiven for briefly forgetting what it took to build this lost kingdom.  And how much the world has changed around it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The monkey temple looks down on Shimla, overrun by its namesakes.  Twisting up further into the Himalayas, I find myself at a place known as the land of the gods, nearly every village credited with having its own deity.  Getting there, you might well have an opportunity to meet one of those deities as you tear around narrow guardrail free mountain roads, overlooking terrifying dropoffs.\\n\\n(on-camera):  I can do heights.  I\\'ve done the jjumping out of the planes thing a number of times.  But I feel it today.  Looking over a precipice like that one, I feel it in my knees.   Like, if my knees could vomit with terror, they would be.  They would be vomiting with terror right now.\\n\\nThey should have little underwear stops on this road where you can get a fresh pair.  Every couple of miles it\\'s like ooh, that was scary.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Overloaded buses, water trucks with worn brake pads, aggressive truck drivers can come whaling around the corner at any time.  And they do.  About every two minutes.  Squeeze your cheeks tight and close your eyes.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh, the enchantment of India.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The remote locations of these isolated mountain villages have kept old traditions alive.\\n\\n(SINGING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Village fairs serve as an opportunity for families who live very far apart to get together, play game, eat and partake in religious rites honoring local deities.\\n\\n(on camera):  Quite a ride getting here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  How did you enjoy that road?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  White knuckles.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Meet Hashim.  He runs motorcycle tours through these parts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (inaudible) is the holy grail of motorcycling. You\\'re traveling almost 1,000 kilometers on the trip.  It\\'s so unbelievably (inaudible).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So we got here vegetable curry?\\n\\nUNIDENITIFIED MALE:  Yogurt based curry, quite typical in these parts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Vegetables again?  Surprisingly, not a problem.\\n\\n(on camera):  That was good.  This is one of the few places in the world that I could eat vegetarian every day and still be happy.\\n\\nMost of the people in this community are farmers?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Farmers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Agricultural?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are they growing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A lot of corn, potatoes, peas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And weed.  People grow marijuana here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, loads.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Most of it as an export product or for personal use?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everything.  A mix of everything.  So you think you want to go check out the fair a little bit?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, let\\'s take a walk through town, see what\\'s going on.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re dominantly (ph) an occasion for all these families to come together and socialize.  Because people are busy in their farms.  They\\'re not going to walk down and socialize with people.  But this, you know, because it\\'s autumn, everyone is done with all the agriculture.  Now they\\'re just bearing down for winter. There\\'s a lot of romance in the air.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve been to Mumbai, Calcotta, (inaudible), Rajasthan, Kerala -- this is a part of India that\\'s different than any other part.  Look, it\\'s fascinating and beautiful.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes. Sweet.\\n\\nWhoa, it\\'s moving.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Voila.  End of the road.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Detroit\\'s the city of champions.  The whole world knows that Detroit is the American city whose products have revolutionized our way of living.  And only in Michigan, when you find the men and women whose talent made us the arsenal of democracy in wartime and the economic pace-setter in peacetime.\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  It\\'s where nearly everything American and great came from.  The things the whole world wanted made here.  The heart, the soul, the beat of an industrial, cultural superpower.  A magnet for everyone with a dream of a better future, from Eastern Europe to the Deep South.  American dream, you came here.\\n\\nThe one straight ahead with the green roof?\\n\\nCHARLIE LEDUFF, JOURNALIST:  Yes.  The big Rococo building, completely empty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Empty?  Unbelievable.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  The white one is being rehabbed.  There\\'s some money coming in.  The one next to it on the right is completely empty.  The gray pyramid with the spire on top sold for $5 million.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  $5 million for that?  That\\'s -- you can\\'t buy a garage in the Hamptons for that basically.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  $5 million for a skyscraper.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is post-apocalyptic.  I mean, it\\'s like a science fiction film.  What the hell happened here?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Well, it is post-apocalyptic except for the fact that there\\'s several hundred thousand people living here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Detroit 2013.  Charlie LeDuff is a writer, journalist, television reporter.  He grew up here.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  But it used to be two million people.  That was rubber.  That guy was steel.  That guy was a doctor.  This was what made America. The road started here.  The automobile.  Frozen peas started here. Credit on a mass scale started here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was this like just before this?  Twenty years before.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  It was insane.  And this is when it was like twice as many people here.  This is a consequence because all the whites went, they took their money, they took their factories.  The black middle class maintained for a while.  And then it got too rough for them.  So there\\'s little pockets of Ferrell hippies and older black folks, a couple of white folks, some Arabs.  But this is 140 square miles.  So you\\'re going to get tall grass because it\\'s back to the wild.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is one of the most beautiful cities in America.  It speaks of those industrial aid dreams of an endlessly glorious future. You know, the people who built these structures, they were thinking big.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  They were.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They were looking at a new Rome and they built it, actually.  It\\'s so awesome here.\\n\\nMaybe the worm started to come here.  The Packard Automotive Plant. Opened in 1903, it was considered the most advanced facility of its kind anywhere in the world.  Huge, epically proportioned.  I mean, 3.35 million square feet.  Now, one man lives here.  Al Hill.\\n\\nALAN HILL, RESIDENT:  My name is Alan Hill.  Welcome to my home.  This room right here is the forge room.  It was a former Packard Motor Car Company.  I started living here about seven years ago.  At that time, I was semi-apprehensive about the place and the goings on around here. But it turns out it\\'s about as peaceful as the north woods.  And not having a credit card or a mortgage payment or a car payment is a real blessing.  There\\'s a few nails here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHILL:  So what\\'s happened here in Detroit is unfortunate, but, you know, it\\'s a sign of the times.  We will find out not only does it take a village to erase individual, it takes an entire world to support one city.  You know, one city is suffering or one community is suffering, the entire world should pitch in and help elevate it instead of sit there and stare at it.\\n\\nPeople have lost faith in a lot of things.  Probably had to do with the faith they had in Detroit.  You know once the industrial might of the entire world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s enormous.\\n\\nHILL:  Yes, it is.  As far as a mile long, maybe a quarter of a mile wide.  I\\'ve got a pretty good view from up here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  How many people worked here at its peak?\\n\\nHILL:  Well, during the war, there were like 33,000 people working here.  It went out of business in \\'56.  You know, they brought Studebaker in as a partner and Studebaker pulled them down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This has been abandoned since the \\'50s?\\n\\nHILL:  Well, actually, what happened, in 1956, they rented out to various entrepreneurs.  A sea warehouse, there\\'s a truck and companies, guys were storing cars.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how long has it been like this, though?\\n\\nHILL:  Most of this damage happened in the last five years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Within the last five years?\\n\\nHILL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nHILL:  China had this Olympia effort.  Scrap metal went to a high price.  So people come in here scraping.  They took the windows out, they just destroyed everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The place is pretty much open to anybody who wants to come in.\\n\\nHILL:  Sure.  A lot of urban explorers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHILL:  People shooting music videos, taking pictures.  Oftentimes you see a wedding party come here.  And, you know, they use this as a backdrop for their wedding and take pictures, videos and what have you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nYou want to take pictures here.  The place, like so much of Detroit, invites it.  Urban exploring, as they call it, sifting through the remains of Detroit\\'s great American ongoing tragedy, photographing them, posing in front of them is something of an irresistible impulse.\\n\\nDetroiters hate it.  All the visitors like us, I should point out, wallowing in ruin porn.\\n\\nWell, is this part of the factory?  Where are we standing?\\n\\nHILL:  This right here is where the assembly line was.  This is a paint booth right here where they spray paint the cars.  You can see in the forward they have the washmen to over spray.  The assembly line ended 35, 40 feet over here.  There\\'s bridges here between here in the main building and the assembly actually came across the bridges. Looking at the possibly of an assembly line about three quarters of a mile long.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re talking hundreds of thousands of people all working on the --\\n\\nHILL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On the process.\\n\\nHILL:  Yes.  BOURDAIN:  I mean, this is sort of a kind of -- you know, it\\'s not a perfect model for Detroit, but it\\'s a perfect model when a big factory goes down, it\\'s not just 33,000 people.  That\\'s 33,000 families who are going to be eating dinner out less.\\n\\nHILL:  You\\'ve got a point there on that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Most people I would guess have no idea what a Packard even was.  We\\'re talking about one of the great luxury cars in the world, yes?\\n\\nHILL:  Yes, it was the kind of car that everybody would love to have. Kings and queens, and every president wanted to ride in one.  Popes and the Indian chiefs.  A luxury car maker went out of business.  You know?  Little did they realize that was a trend that started here in Detroit and when it affected Detroit, it affected the entire world because it followed everybody home.\\n\\nMight have been 50 or 60 years later, but it started here and then everybody else gets to experience the same problem that we\\'re having. And another 20 years, this place probably won\\'t be here and people won\\'t even have any idea what went on over here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s hard to look away from the ruin.  To not find beauty in the decay.  Comparisons to Angkor Wat, Machu Picchu, ancient Rome are inevitable.  Magnificent structures representing the boundless greens of the dead left to rot.  Yet Angkor, that left his magna, people still live here.  We forget that.\\n\\nYou tell people you go to Detroit and chances are somebody from the home team is going to say, \"be sure to get a Coney.\"  I never really understood that.  I mean, I\\'m like 30 minutes from a place called Coney Island where presumably, they know something about freaking hotdogs, right?\\n\\nMaybe the early Greeks or Macedonians who first experienced that golden land by the shore then took what they saw with them to Florida, Michigan, and beyond.  Maybe they knew something.  They\\'ve been doing Coneys at Duly\\'s for over 90 years.  That\\'s almost as long as the hotdog\\'s been around.  And I can\\'t tell you how deep this creation runs here.  Deep dish in Chicago, cheesesteak in Philadelphia.  You\\'ll find some ambivalence.  Not here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How are you, sir?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good.  Now, if I were from Detroit, would I be eating this with my hands or with a fork?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Probably with your hands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  I\\'ll do my best.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Logistical problems.  That\\'s delicious.  This is the best of my only three Coney experiences.\\n\\nYou\\'re open 24 hours.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir, 24/7.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know (INAUDIBLE) watch like seriously drunk people trying to eat this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  We fun time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it a skill that you learn overtime?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  It takes practice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s like kung fu.  You know, you\\'ve got to just practice and practice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.  Practice makes perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s good.  I think I better have another one of these.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, you should.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I\\'ll be better at it the next time around.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One Coney with everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It seems like a simple thing.  Hotdog, chili, raw onion, mustard, steamed bun.  But the delicate interplay between these ingredients when done right is symphonic.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Detroit\\'s problems are well-documented.  A lot of attention has been paid to a history of spectacular mismanagement and corruption.\\n\\nDetroit is hardly alone in this.  (INAUDIBLE) in New York, we forget too soon, was a cesspit of mob influenced corruption.  Chicago, Boston, machine politics, they wrote the book.  But Detroit differs in that its scandal seems so comically lurid.  So surrealistically squalid.  The last mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, is currently serving time in the jug for some of his less hilariously bent behaviors.  Through all of it, one man seems to have known what\\'s going on.\\n\\nAdolph Mongo, political strategist, oracle, survivor.  He\\'s seen it all.\\n\\nI know what I\\'m having, but I\\'d love a beer.\\n\\nADOLPH MONGO, POLITICAL STRATEGIST:  It is a discounted place, man.  I thought you drank, man.  You drinking beer?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are you drinking?\\n\\nMONGO:  I\\'m drinking vodka.  BOURDAIN:  I\\'ll have -- I\\'ll fold under pressure.\\n\\nMONGO:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Then I\\'ll think about a burger down the way.  You having something to eat?\\n\\nMONGO:  I\\'m eating.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  I\\'ll hold back.  I will -- I will stick with this --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I\\'ll get you your drink and then you can decide.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nI have to ask, you\\'re born and raised in the Detroit area?\\n\\nMONGO:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An academic star.  Marine Corps.  Journalism.  Why did you never run for office?\\n\\nMONGO:  You got to be crazy.  You know what?  They don\\'t want straight forward politicians.  They don\\'t last.  You got to be real cold- blooded.  Men are elected officials like working for the drug cartel. You can\\'t get anybody any mercy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, it seems that whatever might be in your heart and however pure you might be, when you finally arrive in office, somebody brings you a big dossier and opens it up and said, Mr. President, or Mr. Mayor, or Mr. Governor, this is the real situation.  At which point it\\'s an ocean trying to start making some serious accommodations.\\n\\nMONGO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So Kwame Kilpatrick.  Want to flow in one there.\\n\\nMONGO:  Greedy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Old school --\\n\\nMONGO:  Greedy.  He was greedy.  I didn\\'t support him in the beginning.  And when he was -- and I was one of his biggest critics. But when he got in trouble, who he call?  He called me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He called you.\\n\\nMONGO:  I should have listened to my wife.  She said, don\\'t be messing with him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there good guys out there?  Presumably --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Run for office who would win?\\n\\nMONGO:  There\\'s a lot of guys, yes.  But they don\\'t want to run. There\\'s a lot of people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why don\\'t they want to run?\\n\\nMONGO:  Because you\\'ve got to take the badge that come along with it. You got to take the garbage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why should a bright young guy out of -- fresh out of law school start thinking about running for anything in the city of Detroit?\\n\\nMONGO:  Yes, because sooner or later, it\\'s going to be all right. It\\'s going to be all right.  It\\'s a tough town.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is Detroit going to turn things around?  I could lie and tell you yes.  But you know what?  This city is screwed.  Only place I\\'ve ever been that looks anything like Detroit does now, Chernobyl. I\\'m not being funny.  That\\'s the truth.\\n\\nAbandoned.  Man.\\n\\nBut you have to admire the bold, proud, ferociously enterprising survivors who decided to hang on, hang in, and figure out a way to not only survive, but do something extraordinary.  There\\'s Tyree Guyton\\'s Heidelberg Project, the delightfully loony outdoor community art project that began in 1986 and now attracts 35,000 visitors per year from around the world.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  That was a buck in gas right there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI love Detroit.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  You know, they got this field mowed last summer.  The neighborhood lit it on fire.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Another block and more decay.  And a liquor store.  In this neighborhood, it\\'s the only store for miles.\\n\\nJust be right back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How you doing?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hey.  How are you?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I love you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Awesome spirit on you, man.  God bless you.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Hi, how are you?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ain\\'t nobody do it like you.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  See you later.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Cheers, man.  Yes.  You want one?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s the benefit of a college education right there. People seem to like you in this town.  Who hates you in this town?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Who hates me in this town?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nobody.  Huh?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Politicians?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m guessing there are a number of politicians and former public employees who are not too happy.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  I don\\'t know.  You know, yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, but let\\'s face it.  There\\'s a whole lot of people out there who would be perfectly happy with just letting Detroit go.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  It already went.  Look at this.  See those lilies there?  I call those the ghost gardens.  Like they\\'re all over like the houses that used to be, the gardens still come up.\\n\\nOff the main drag --\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Girl, you\\'re wearing the hat and everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A backyard.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Thanks for coming.  I never had such a good time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A well-tended home surrounded by many neglected ones.  An example of Detroit-style entrepreneurship.  Greedy Greg\\'s, a do-it- yourself barbecue joint, started by these two.  Rochelle and Greg.\\n\\nGREEDY GREG, RESTAURANT OWNER:  I\\'m Greedy Greg.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On the menu, absolutely delicious straight-from-the-grill ribs and rib tips.  But the really good stuff is inside.  Superb smoked pork loaded collards, and mac and cheese.\\n\\nThank you so much.  This is perfect.  That\\'s good.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Well, I\\'m going to use this spoon here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s unbelievably good.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  What, the mac?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The greens are incredible.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Oh, those are good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So the greens, is that like smoked ham hoc?\\n\\nROCHELLE GREG, RESTAURANT OWNER:  I can\\'t tell you my secret.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can\\'t tell.  Well, I\\'ll tell you, those are some of the best greens I\\'ve ever had.  No doubt about it.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  And this dude\\'s been everything.\\n\\nR. GREG:  Come on now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  I\\'ve been all over the south.  I\\'ve had a lot of greens and those are some -- they\\'re not just delicious.  They\\'re luxurious.  Big hunks of you-won\\'t-tell-me-what in there.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nR. GRE:  I can\\'t tell you my secret.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Will this kind of entrepreneurship lead Detroit out of its sinkhole?  Probably not.  I can\\'t believe there\\'s not a line of cars around the corner.  That was good.  But it\\'s no longer about winning, is it?  It\\'s about surviving.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are approximately 80,000 abandoned buildings within Detroit\\'s 140-square-mile city limits.  What that translates to, unfortunately, is about 14 acts of arson a day.  Nearly 5,000 a year. That\\'s just arson.  That doesn\\'t include the thousands of other types of fires and medical emergencies the Detroit Fire Department responds to every day.\\n\\nWith an ever-lower valued housing market where you can buy a home for as little as $500, many houses are burned down for the insurance. Many because angry neighbors desperate to hang on see abandoned structures taken over by crack heads or drug gangs.\\n\\nWith law enforcement stretched ridiculously thin, they resort to burning them out.  They won\\'t say it.  I will.  The Detroit Fire Department is underfunded, underequipped, often badly and incompetently led, and up against what seems like a never ending war.\\n\\nA city on fire.  Their safety equipment, their boots, their clothes are often moldering and shambolic.  But they fight on.\\n\\nThis is the second time they\\'ve been to this house.  If it happens to be arson, chances are no one will ever know for sure.  Given the ever- shrinking resources available to the department, most fires can\\'t even be investigated.\\n\\nThis fire is out within an hour.  And after the fire, dinner.\\n\\nThe cliche is that firemen are great cooks.  In this case, the cliche is true.  Lieutenant Mike Devons and the boys of Squad Three are cooking up a family meal.\\n\\nIs ever firefighter expected to cook reasonably well?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If they don\\'t, they catch hell.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I mean, in Detroit, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s almost a perfect society in that sense.  Because in a perfect society, I believe everybody should be able to feed themselves and their friends or their family at least reasonably well.  That if they\\'re not able to do that, they should be shunned and demonized and marginalized.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, agreed.  Most of the firemen are known for their cooking.  We cook some outstanding meals.  We\\'ve learned to shop.  We\\'ve learned to shop with less to feed more.  You don\\'t want to be a belly robber.  You better bring some food back for the boys.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Firefighters, in my experience, are a lot like the Marines I\\'ve met over the years.  No matter how badly led, ridiculously underequipped, underappreciated, no matter how doomed their mission, they take a bizarre and quite beautiful pride in at least being screwed more than everybody else and doing it with style.  They seem to do what they do for themselves.  It\\'s not a job.  It\\'s a calling.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is where the guys store their gear.  As you can see, the gear is very weathered.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How old?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This gear is only a couple of years old.  I mean --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But it gets beat up quick.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Got one new coat hanging in there, so there\\'s a lucky guy that\\'s got a new coat.  But that gear\\'s seen a lot of action.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where\\'s the fire pole, dude?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They took them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aw, man.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Late \\'90s, management took the poles out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What -- that means little boy, you know, my age, it was all about Sparky the fire sliding the poles.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, I used to love sliding the pole.  And the headquarters was three stories.  So when you were sliding in that thing you had to really hold on because you were going for a ride. The old running board, we put up here.  We don\\'t use the running board, but this is how many companies we used to have.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What percentage of that number now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Less than half.  And we\\'re fighting a lot more fires.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, I\\'ve got to say, the kitchen is looking pretty good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s one of the best kitchens in the city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight\\'s meal is being cooked by Paul.  He\\'s Squad Three\\'s best, they say.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He\\'s reading the can.  That\\'s a good start.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight\\'s menu, crab cakes with a mix of actual crab, and this stuff.  Sea leg.  Maybe you know it from such beloved menu items as California roll.  Hey, firefighters can\\'t afford 100 percent jumbo lump crab meat, OK?\\n\\nDo you know what this stuff is, by the way?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s fish, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pollack.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pollack.  Right.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s a miracle fish.  You can actually make beef out of this, or beef-like substance.  Yes.\\n\\nIt should be pointed out that every meal is paid for by the crew on duty.  They pool their money and shop as a unit.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the fire house favorite by consensus?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Steaks, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Steaks.  If I were the -- you know, the regular cook here, the whole fire house would be in totally open rebellion?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'d be making stews because they\\'re cheap and I think they\\'re delicious.  Plus I\\'d be trying it out like tripe and guts on you guys.  I don\\'t know how that would go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That would not go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'d be eating like Italian peasants every day if I was to cook here.  That pretty much -- you\\'d have like a big bowl of stew with a big hunk of bread.  And I would be about it.  And I\\'d be pocketing the difference.  Yes.\\n\\nLamb chops seared in the pan then finished over the grill.  Then Caesar\\'s salad with chicken.\\n\\nEver find out -- how are the other firefighters eating around the city?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, I got (INAUDIBLE).  What are you guys having for chow?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You ever tempted to just kind of like, to the other guys, say, oh yes, we had like foie gras with truffles and --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, the generation L.A. at the other day --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m going to be cooking lobster in a minute.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Lobster again.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, I keep telling the guys no more lobster, I just can\\'t take it.  We\\'re free to eat?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nice job on the crab cakes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Full of meat.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Very tasty.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if it\\'s not good, you\\'re not diplomatic about it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, not at all.  No.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We tell them nice try.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A lot of cooks, they look at that kitchen, there\\'s a lot of room and there\\'s always a lot of spices.  Our staples are always loaded.  You can pretty much make anything in there.  It\\'s a good place to be a cook.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nice job there, Paulie.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, well-done, sir.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you eat fast.  Because you never know.  In all likelihood, you are not going to get to finish that meal.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, obviously Tony is not doing any dishes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll do all the dishes --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  Hell, no.  No way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wouldn\\'t be the first time, won\\'t be the last.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No way.  No way.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At this point, you may be asking, what about all the cool stuff I hear about Detroit?  That\\'s what you\\'re thinking.  The vibrant, new, do-it-yourself culture of urban renaissance, young entrepreneurs, artists, transforming the city one block at a time. Where\\'s that?\\n\\nWell, that is happening.  Young, idealistic, true believing, hard- working creative people are indeed doing their best to bring light and hope and beauty to this greatest of cities.  You\\'ve got to start with the deeply felt and absolute belief that Detroit is indeed a great city and that it is worth saving.\\n\\nAs utterly screwed as Detroit may be, you have to be a twisted, unpatriotic freak to not believe that.  Behold the future.\\n\\nCharlie (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nLEDUFF:  What, like cooking in a back alley?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chef Craig Lieckfelt has done what many would call a very unwise thing.  After working at Gotham Grill and Jean-Georges in Manhattan, instead of staying where the money inarguably was, he returned to Detroit.  He\\'s been working to get a brick-and-mortar establishment going by first doing regular pop-ups here at Guns and Butter, tucked into the back room of an art gallery, under an overpass in downtown Detroit.\\n\\nDo you have like a really weird attitude towards food in general?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What\\'s that?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  You know, you got -- like cigarettes, you get coffee.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or all of that.  We\\'re going to eat well.\\n\\nCharlie LeDuff may have a Pulitzer Prize, but his appreciation of fine food and dining is, shall we say --\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Is that cheese?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lacking.  Simply put, he\\'s a Philistine.  Worn egg yolk with a generous helping smelt grow on top.  Egg with eggs?  Yes, please.  LeDuff scarves his like he\\'s at Ruby Tuesday\\'s.\\n\\nYou know, you get all these kids flooding into Detroit.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Which is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  How is that going to play out?  Will there be political leadership in place to manage that fairly?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  It will be fine.  Everybody likes a nice little thing in an egg shell with caviar.  Everybody.  It\\'s just all about keeping cool.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, it won\\'t be fine, David.  It will not be fine if there\\'s not political leadership.  It will not.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Well, you know, sometimes political leadership grows up out of what\\'s happening.  And we don\\'t have any political leadership and this is happening.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you an optimist --\\n\\nLEDUFF:  I\\'m an optimist.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re an optimist despite --\\n\\nLEDUFF:  I\\'m here in this -- I\\'m in this garage with you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Chilled summer soup with melon, tomato, lemon Barbino broth.\\n\\nCRAIG LIECKFELT, CHEF:  Summer soup.  All the melons from the market. The coriander blossoms, we actually picked from a farm right here in Detroit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful.  Thank you.\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  Thank you.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  It\\'s good, isn\\'t it?  I would describe that -- if May I, Chef?  As a light, airy gazpacho.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Delicious.  I wouldn\\'t even go that far.\\n\\nThe drop sees an opportunity to make a melon (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nLEDUFF:  A little gin in it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re putting gin in your soup?\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Well, the soup is delicious.  Let me -- let me try this --  BOURDAIN:  You\\'re on your own, dude.  You know, when I was chef and you poured gin in my soup, I would have stabbed you in the neck with my fork.  I\\'m dying somewhere inside.  You\\'re like the worst-case scenario customer.\\n\\nNext up, smoked mussels in a lightly steamed in white wine, aromatics and butter, served in a lobster broth with fried onions, honey and (INAUDIBLE).  Quite delicious.\\n\\nBaby Greek salad with beets, tomato and fennel.  All sourced locally. A tribute to the Greek diners where Craig grew up eating with his family.\\n\\nSteak can be running (INAUDIBLE) and see a restaurant in Vegas, and here he is in Detroit.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Well, guess what?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s heroic thing.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  The headaches are less.  You\\'re appreciated here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  This is -- no.  This is --\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This would be considered foolhardy venture in the chef world.\\n\\nLEDUFF:  Guess what?  We like good food, too.  We\\'re not space aliens.\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  People say -- they often say, thank you.  Like -- we just moved back from Chicago.  We lived in Chicago the last six years.  We lived in L.A. the last six years.  Thank you, this is exactly what we wanted.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What you\\'ve done is counterintuitive.  I mean, there is sort of conventional career path for chefs.\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Instead, you decide to go to Detroit.\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  Hell yes.  Come back home.  People think I\\'m crazy for going back to Detroit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Then another tribute to classic Detroit.  Potato filled (INAUDIBLE) and kielbasa simmered in white wine, thyme and fennel seeds.  Finished with burr fondue and burr butter pine nuts.  Followed by locally sourced lamb cooked perfectly.  Topped with sour cherries, mulberries, toasted pistachios, coriander, and yogurt sauce.\\n\\nIn what way does opening a fine dining restaurant in Detroit benefit the majority of Detroiters?\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  How is it not making it better?  How is sitting back not doing anything making it better?  How is it only buying my products from Detroit or farmers in Detroit not helping Detroit?  I\\'m supplying from Detroit.  I\\'m hiring people from Detroit.  Everybody here lives in Detroit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If I were asked the same question, I would say I don\\'t -- you know, I\\'m doing what I do well.\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  Right.  Exactly.  I mean --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m doing it in a place I love and I am demonstrating that yet another person gives a -- about Detroit and believes in it enough to be here.\\n\\nLIECKFELT:  You\\'re 100 percent right.  I never really thought about it.  Until you asked that question.  It\\'s like -- to me, it\\'s just obvious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What will the Detroit of the future look like?  Whatever you may think it should look like, it will probably taste like this.\\n\\nHey, people, I hope you\\'re enjoying our trip into the greatest city in America, Detroit.  I am live in Las Vegas.  I got a beer in hand and in 20 minutes, I\\'ll be here with some of my friends, like Wendell Pierce, Marcus Samuelson, the hilarious Bonnie McFarlane, and we\\'re going to confer on all the big moments of season two.  The ups, the downs, and all the glorious insanity of that Tokyo episode.  Stay tuned.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Somewhere in this unassuming neighborhood, one can sit down for an excellent meal.  But you won\\'t find this place on yelp, and unfortunately, I cannot tell you where it is exactly.  Why not, you ask?  It\\'s not exactly a restaurant, you see, which means it\\'s not, strictly speaking, legal.\\n\\nWhat is this place?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pupusa house.  I call it pupusa house.  I mean like a pupusaria, I guess, you could say.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a cultural thing.  Traditionally they serve out of their houses.  And it\\'s just something that people bring over and they come.  So this is about as traditional as it gets right here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s just like home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is what\\'s called a Pupusa house.  Literally, a house. This one serving home-cooked Salvadorian meals.  Once a living room, now the main dining area.  The woman running it, we can\\'t show her face, but she\\'s been here for 10 years serving a mostly Salvadoran clientele, looking for a taste of home.\\n\\nFirst up a staple done a little differently than the norm.  Tamales wrapped in banana leaf and steamed.\\n\\nDelicious.\\n\\nNext the dish of the house, pupusas.  Tortillas stuffed with ground pork or chicharon.\\n\\nYou have pupusas in Nicaragua, in Guatemala.  But for some reason, Salvadorian pupusas get the most respect.  General consensus seems to be they\\'re the best.  How come?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would agree.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  George Azar is our Detroit fixer.  He\\'s been coming here with his friend Joe for years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is what makes it right here, boom, is this. Cortido.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cortido.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cortido.  It\\'s like the pickled (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Salsa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Then I\\'ll do this but I don\\'t know if you (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are you saying?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t know if you can hang, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is it a manly thing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I mean, it\\'s turning into it, it seems like.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mexican spice.  Salvadorian, not spicy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s true, though.  They don\\'t like it.  They don\\'t it that spicy.  Wow.  Chicharon?  Yes.  This is porky goodness in there, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Chicharon is fried pork.  Fried pork and then ground with pepper and tomato.  Simple.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Taking the liberty of ordering some indigenous Detroit beverages that we\\'ve egregiously overlooked so far.  Now we (INAUDIBLE) which I have --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s like a cross between ginger beer and ginger ale.  It\\'s like not as spicy as ginger beer and not as sweet as ginger ale.  It\\'s like in the middle.  It\\'s my favorite beverage in the city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I needed this to enhance my street cred in Detroit.  Then I will be welcomed back.  Then pollo asado.  A shrimp and garlic butter.  Let\\'s shrimp head on, thank you very much.\\n\\nThis is where it\\'s at.  God lives in there.\\n\\nButter, garlic.  Simple, delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s the low-fat butter.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s like a big hug.  How did you find your way here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Honestly, it\\'s only word of mouth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, but you have annoying foodie Web sites, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But they\\'re not coming here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re not coming here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, no.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are thousands of foodies with ironic sunglasses and fedoras and they\\'re just weakly get in here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don\\'t want this place to come -- I get mad at him when he starts bringing different people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  You\\'d hate a line of people outside waiting --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Two-hour wait to get in here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t want to wait for my plate.  Who hates money?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With her, it\\'s not about the money.  It\\'s about keeping the tradition alive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happens when a city goes bankrupt?  When it\\'s at the point that it\\'s actually considering selling what\\'s left of itself in chunks.  In Detroit, city services are reduced or cut out completely. Fewer buses, fewer cops, fewer firefighters.  Answer, they turn to each other for help or figure out how to do it for themselves. Detroit has a reputation as a tough town, but that toughness is about resilience, too.  The insistence on sticking with it, no matter what.\\n\\nOn not giving up in the face of the utter failure of leadership year after year.  If the city abandons its parks and leaves them to become overgrown, eaten by so much of the rest of the city by tall grass and weeds, then somebody has got to do something, right?\\n\\nMeet the mower gang.  Started by this guy, Tom Nardone, with a simple mission of doing what they can to keep Detroit\\'s abandoned parks maintained.\\n\\nWho are you guys and what are you doing here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are the Detroit mower gang.  And we clean up the abandoned parks and playgrounds in this town.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why would you do that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kids need a place to play.  I don\\'t care who you are.  You know, if you\\'re under 10 years old, I think you deserve some justice in this world, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did this thing start?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I guess I started it.  I bought a lawn tractor when the city announced they\\'re closing 72 parks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What does it mean (INAUDIBLE) open and close?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re just going to stop maintaining?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or are they actually physically shut it up?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no.  They don\\'t physically shut it up. Because there\\'s no money here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just physically shut it up.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  They just -- they just take the trash barrels away and stop mowing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Crazy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a strange place, Detroit.  When we\\'re done here, it will not look like a nice park.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But still a playable park.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  And a visible park.  So if you had kids, you could see what they\\'re doing in this park.  It\\'s safer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  Well, let\\'s cut some grass.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Come on, you\\'ll like it.  It\\'s fun.  BOURDAIN:  There\\'s grass in my beer.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In Detroit approximately 40 square miles have been reverted to basically unused green space.  In many cities, so-called urban farming may be looked upon by cynics like my as an affectation.\\n\\nHere in Detroit, it\\'s not.  With nature taking back the landscape block by block, the urban farm is really the last line of defense.  D- Town sits on the western border of Detroit.\\n\\nWhere are we?\\n\\nMALIK YAKINI, ROUGE PARK:  We\\'re in the largest park in the city which is called Rouge Park.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you just come in and start digging or did you have permission to come in?\\n\\nYAKINI:  We had permission to come in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Was that difficult?\\n\\nYAKINI:  It was very difficult.  We negotiated with the city for two years.  Part of the difficulty was they really didn\\'t know what hook to hang our request on.  They\\'re used to developers come and say I want to build a strip mall or I want to build a parking structure. But they\\'re not used to people saying, we want land to build a model organic farm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Malik Yakini started the farm with the goal of providing greater access to fresh produce in areas that grocery stores have completely abandoned.  That\\'s basically all of Detroit\\'s inner city.\\n\\nOther than Whole Foods that just came in.\\n\\nYAKINI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not a single national food chain.\\n\\nYAKINI:  No.  No.  In 2007 Farmer Jack closed his last stores in Detroit.  And that was kind of the end of the big chains in Detroit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is subsistence farming, not cash crop.  You\\'re not going to be --\\n\\nYAKINI:  No, no --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re not anticipating selling outside of Detroit.\\n\\nYAKINI:  There\\'s greater demand in Detroit than all of the farmers locally can supply.  So first we want to supply that local demand in the city of Detroit.  BOURDAIN:  To what degree do you think that this model can be replicated in and around the city?\\n\\nYAKINI:  Well, clearly, we think urban agriculture has great potential.  And one of the things that we have in Detroit is access to huge amounts of land.  If we\\'re able to produce even a small percentage of the food which is consumed in Detroit and circulate the revenues from that food within our community, then we\\'re able to create a more vibrant, healthy, economically strong community.  So we think it has tremendous potential.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who will live in the Detroit of the future?  There\\'s no question, is there, that Detroit will come back?  In one form or another, a city this magnificent, this storied, this American cannot, will not ever disappear into the weeds.  There are too few places this beautiful for it to be allowed to crumble like Ankor or Rome.\\n\\nSomeone will live in a smaller, tighter, no doubt hipper, much contracted new Detroit.  But who will that be?  Will it be the people who stuck it out here, who fought block-by-block to keep their city from burning, who struggled to defend their homes, keep up appearances as all around them their neighborhoods emptied.\\n\\nWhat will Detroit look like in 20 years?  Or 50?  That\\'s not just a Detroit question.  That\\'s an America question.\\n\\nHi.  We\\'re live smack in the middle of shooting new episodes but taking a break here at Atomic Liquors in Las Vegas to look back at the filth, the fury, the weirdness, and deliciousness of season two. Including our disturbing psychoclassic Tokyo.\\n\\nWe\\'re talking about issues raised and maybe looking forward a bit to what\\'s next.\\n\\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  From the crowded multi-layered pinball streets of Tokyo.\\n\\nIt was the greatest show in the history of entertainment.\\n\\nTo the overgrown lots and empty factories of Detroit.\\n\\nWhat the hell happened here?\\n\\nThis season has been a wild ride.  Big game in South Africa.  Small rodents in New Mexico.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got a lot of them in New York.\\n\\nThe less and gentle crusting into (INAUDIBLE) region by a bull of faith.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beautiful, right?  we can already indulge ourselves into something special, such a beautiful day.\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  Pony ride.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.  Now we are coming to your most beautiful fascination side of Russian legacy, the birches, the forest of birch.\\n\\nAh, what a place.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  All hail, the maximum leader.  Now let\\'s dance.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Thank you.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whatever you think of this guy, his dead, affectless eyes, his smooth pulled tight like a snare drum face, he ain\\'t going anywhere.  Look at him.  He\\'s the Russian superman, the KGB middle manager desk jockey turned expression of Greater Russia\\'s hopes and dreams.\\n\\nHe lets no opportunity to take his shirt off pass him by.  Pose with a large gun, he\\'s there.  And no matter how transparently autocratic, vengeful, oblivious to even a thin veneer of democracy, Russians love him.  They seem to feel about him like New Yorkers used to feel about Giuliani.  He may be a son of a bitch, but he\\'s our son of a bitch.\\n\\nIt\\'s February 2014, and the Sochi Olympics are just coming up when I arrive in Moscow.  It\\'s a different Moscow every time I come here. The \\'80s style go-go capitalist conspicuous consumption see who can spend the most money disco-techno thing that I encountered when I first came here  back in 2001, it\\'s still going strong.  In fact, these days, Moscow has one of the highest concentrations of billionaires in the world.  But as never before, its imperial Russia now, a one-man rule.  All power emanates, every decision must consider, this guy.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Russia is full of characters with murky pasts and shadowy connections.  But one of them I\\'ve called a friend for more than a decade.\\n\\nZAMIR GOTTA:  Tony! wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I guess I\\'m switching to vodka.  Zamir.\\n\\nNow, my concern is back in the day, this place was famous for all of the rooms were bugged.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Not anymore, I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, really?  I\\'m really sorry about that.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Times change.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Poor Zamir, my long-time crony, he tries at least to be diplomatic about these things.  I mean, he\\'s got to live here, right?  He doesn\\'t want plusic (ph) acid on his blintzes.\\n\\n(on camera):  Given the new, enlightened, the liberalized, forward- thinking Russia, they\\'ve removed the surveillance devices?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Listen, as a born Moscowite, I\\'m trying to be a good patron. So I really want you to tell me, frankly, in a week from now, Zamir, now I understand why stereotypes sometimes send a bad message about Russia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have an open mind.  Everything\\'s great.  Russians have everything they want.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Listen.  Why don\\'t we just taste the vodka.\\n\\nOh, thank you.  The most gorgeous women are in Russia.  Welcome to Russia.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to be kind of sober.  United we stand.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I prepared the special for you.  Russian tapas. Especially good (ph) for drinking with small pancakes like blinis and caviar.  Lots of cucumber with honey.  This is Baltic sprouts.  Smoky (INAUDIBLE) with beet root, and this one is (INAUDIBLE), this is a white fish frozen with smolten (ph) salt and a little bit pepper and you can eat your own.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you, sir.  I\\'m hitting the caviar and the blini.  Oy- yoy-yoy.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Maybe some more vodka.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nGOTTA:  And your smile makes it feel like it\\'s water.\\n\\nWhat do you think?  What is the perception of Mr. Putin these days, after 14 years he\\'s in power?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My perception?  You really want to hear it?  GOTTA:  I\\'m not sure, but let\\'s see.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A former midlevel manager in a large corporation, short -- I think that\\'s very important, short -- who has found himself master of the universe.  And like a lot of short people, if you piss them off, bad things happen to you.  He likes to take his shirt off a lot.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Let\\'s be serious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He strikes me as a businessman.\\n\\nGOTTA:  He is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A businessman with an ego.  OK.  So he\\'s like Donald Trump but shorter.\\n\\nGOTTA:  I think my friend needs some kind of booze.  To you, comrade. Like this, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can have that one.  I\\'ll get the other two.\\n\\nGOTTA:  I\\'m serious about your one week stay in Russia.  I want you to enjoy every minute of it.  I hope you\\'ll get something new, positive, to learn and share around the world.  That\\'s my mission.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nGOTTA:  OK, Tony, so new experience, right, being part of the opposition rally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is nothing new for me.  Blows against the empire. Speed fight (ph) the man.  That\\'s me.  I go way back with this.  I marched on the Pentagon with my dad when I was a kid.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Seriously.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yep.\\n\\nGOTTA:  So you are well prepared.  It is physical and brutal today.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t know.  If that dog was aiming for my nut sack, my day as a dissident will be over quickly.\\n\\n(voice-over):  There is opposition to Putin but it\\'s a mixed bag.\\n\\n(SHOUTING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you do see a demonstration like this one, it is with permission along a planned route, carefully managed, and the cops and security tend to outnumber the demonstrators.\\n\\nGOTTA:  The main topic of this rally is to support the political prisoners.  Last May when they came to protest against Putin\\'s re- election, which allegedly was also rigged. BOURDAIN (on camera):  The election results were, shall we say, dubious.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Some of them were arrested and put in prison and some of them are still there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Divide and conquer?  well, look who showed up today.  Everybody from human rights activists to ultra right-wing nationalists who think Putin has been too soft.\\n\\n(on camera):  Putin is not right wing enough for them.\\n\\nGOTTA:  No.  He\\'s like a liberal to them.  He doesn\\'t refuse immigrant workers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  I\\'m sort of kind of shocked that these guys are at the same demonstration.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Russians are not united against one political agenda.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The only thing that\\'s uniting this group is general unhappiness with Putin.\\n\\nGOTTA:  That\\'s it.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Bad things seem to happen to critics of Vladimir Putin.  Journalists, activists, even powerful oligarchs once seemingly untouchable, are now fair game if they displease the leader.\\n\\n(on camera):  So we were supposed to be dining at another restaurant this evening and when they heard that you would be joining me, we were uninvited.  Should I be concerned about having dinner with you?\\n\\nBORIS NEMTSOV, FMR. DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OF RUSSIA:  This is a country of corruption.  And if you have business, you are in a very unsafe situation.  Everybody can press you and destroy your business. That\\'s it.  This is a system.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Meet Boris Nemtsov.  He was deputy prime minister under Yeltsin and today is one of Putin\\'s most vocal critics.\\n\\nThis restaurant was kind enough to take us in, but the chef is a Brit so maybe he has less reason to worry.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  First course, gentlemen?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At Yornik restaurant, they are serving their own versions of dino-era Russian classics.  A modern riff on borscht, typically a chunky, hearty cabbage broth with chunks meat, here it\\'s a puree with a more elegant, shall we say, deconstructed presentation.\\n\\n(on camera):  Critics of the government, critics of Putin, bad things seem to happen to them.\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  Yes.  Unfortunately, existing power represent what I say Russia of 19th century, not of 21st.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Critics of Putin, beware.  Oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and wound up spending ten years in prison and labor camps.  Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power.  He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium.  And Viktor Yushchenko, the former Ukrainian president, poisoned, disfigured and nearly killed by a toxic dose of dioxin.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying official Russian bodies had anything to do with it, but it\\'s mighty suspicious.\\n\\n(on camera):  I don\\'t think you need to be a conspiracy theorist to say whoever did this very much wanted everyone to know who done it. Everybody understands.\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  Yes, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And everybody is meant to understand.\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  Yes, everybody understands.  Everybody understands everything in this country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When you\\'re talking classic conspiracy theories and classically Russian style paranoia, you want some classic Russian food to go along with it.  Pelmini, minced meat dumplings served on a pillow of cabbage with sour cream.\\n\\n(on camera):  Mm, very good.  Maybe the most extreme and visible example of how things seem to work here is the Sochi Olympics.\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  If you look at the map of Russian Federation, it\\'s difficult to find a sport without knowing the (INAUDIBLE), but Putin did.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It seems like a pretty obvious question, if you wanted to hold a winter Olympics in Miami, presumably someone would say isn\\'t it a little warm there?\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  This is absolutely personal Putin project.  They spent more than $50 billion of dollars, which is the most expensive Games in the history of mankind.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  $26,000 a seat for the curling stadium?  To build?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Per seat.\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  (INAUDIBLE) road from Adler to Krasnaya Polyana, which is 30 miles, price for that, $9 billion U.S.  This is a road, right?  It\\'s three times expensive than American program flying to Mars.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And who got many of those contracts for the roads and stadiums and infrastructure?  Well, there\\'s these guys. Putin\\'s childhood friends and judo partners, the Rottenburg brothers, whose companies received contracts worth upwards of $7 billion.  And Putin\\'s associate of 20 years, Vladimir Yakunin, who owns the state railroads.  His company received $10 billion worth of contracts.  NEMTSOV:  It\\'s very easy to imagine what\\'s happened with this money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\n(voice-over):  And you know who cares in Russia?  Just about no one.\\n\\n(on camera):  And here\\'s -- this is a case of the Litvinenko case, a known enemy of Putin stricken with a bout of radioactive polonium. Aren\\'t you concerned?\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  Me, about myself?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  You\\'re a pain in the ass.\\n\\nNEMTSOV:  Tony, I was born here 54 years ago.  This is my country. The Russian people are in bit of trouble.  Russian court doesn\\'t work. Russian education decline every year.  I believe that Russia has a chance to be free.  Has a chance.  It\\'s difficult but we must do it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  America, yes.  All of Russia\\'s eyes are upon you.  Bring honor to your clan.\\n\\nGOTTA:  You know what, America, I will break you.  I will break you. (SINGING IN RUSSIAN)\\n\\nForget about it.  I\\'ll bury you.  I\\'ll revoke your visa!  No!  Russia doesn\\'t surrender!\\n\\nBOURDAIN (singing):  O\\'er the land of the free.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Just missed it, buddy.  That was pretty close.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was actually out here all last night practicing.\\n\\nGOTTA:  You must be kidding.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  While Zamir contemplates a suddenly grimmer future thanks to me, I head out to Rublevka, a compound of luxury homes outside Moscow, to meet Alexander Lebedev.  At one time, Alexander was doing great.  Former officer of the intelligence services, like Putin, turned billionaire.  He owned pieces of Russia\\'s most powerful energy companies, airlines and banks, and still publishes the Novaya Gazeta, one of the only opposition newspapers left in Russia.\\n\\nBut running a newspaper that\\'s been harshly critical of the ruler has cost him.  He\\'s been stripped of nearly everything.\\n\\n(on camera):  It can be a dangerous thing to do investigative journalism in this country.  Your own paper, what, five journalists, six lost their lives?\\n\\nALEXANDER LEBEDEV, PUBLISHER, NOVAY GAZETA: Yes.  Probably the biggest number because there was no war in this country.  So in peaceful times, to lose six journalists killed is quite a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Six journalists murdered, one paper. Presumably for their reporting on political corruption or human rights abuse.  Though pointing a finger directly at the government is impossible, one can say that the climate here is such that what you say can certainly get you killed.\\n\\n(on camera):  You have at various stages made life difficult for yourself.  Business was very good for you, and then you had to have an opinion.\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  When you interact with the local bureaucracies and judicial system, it still leaves a lot to be desired, let\\'s put it this way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Lebedev is now a potato farmer.\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  That\\'s my production.  That\\'s my potato.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The biggest producer in Russia, true, but his billions are gone.  He now lives the life of a mere millionaire.\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  Let\\'s see how you like this one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Mm, very good.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Some freshly made potato chips that Levedev is very proud of.  And his personal chef prepares Scottish salmon, smoked on cherry tree sawdust, served with avocado.\\n\\n(on-camera):  Mm. That was very good.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Lately, he is getting into slow food.\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  This is cold pressed cedar tree in Siberia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Cedar oil?\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  From coal  (ph), from the cedar coal (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  But he has not slowed down his profile or kept his mouth shut.  Recently, in a Russian talk show, he got in an argument over the financial crisis with another guest, a heated argument.  He ended up smacking the guy.\\n\\n(on camera):  I saw the incident on television that got you in trouble.  I found it very refreshing, actually, I think it\\'s something that political discourse could use more of.\\n\\n(voice-over):  The government took the opportunity to charge him with politically motivated hooliganism, a charge that could have resulted in a penalty of five years in prison.  He is instead been convicted of battery.  He is working off his sentence painting fences and shoveling snow.\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  I mean, sitting on a bench and expecting to spend the next five years in prison with two small kids, it\\'s not always, you know, very nice.  But the guy said something very bad.  He said those who don\\'t have a billion, go (EXPLETIVE) themselves.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Though his victim did not register an official complaint, the message I think was clear.\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  The charges were pressed by the Russian state, which is pretty funny because this is a private accusation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It\\'s dangerous, very dangerous, to criticize or investigate or speculate.  Why?  Why do you care?\\n\\nLEBEDEV:  Do you really think you can defeat it? No. So why do it?  I hope. Hopefully, reason will prevail.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nPRODUCER (text):  We\\'re getting a couple audio hits.  We just need to change the channel.\\n\\nTRAVIS LINK, MANAGER, LUNA:  It\\'s the KGB.  They\\'re blocking your signal.\\n\\nPRODUCER: I think they\\'re listening to it.\\n\\nLINK:  I\\'m sure that they are, believe it or not.  I\\'m quite sure you\\'ve had someone on your tail the entire time you\\'ve been here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What\\'s rock and roll supposed to be about other than cars and girls and aggression?  About dissent.  About rebellion, right?  In Russia, where everything is supposed to be just fine, that can be a dangerous position.\\n\\nTravis Link is an ex-pat American who manages this band, Luna.  Ruben Kazarian is Luna\\'s guitarist and song writer.\\n\\nRUBEN KAZARIAN, GUITARIST, LUNA:  What we have now here is a facade and it\\'s very nice, we have elections, democracy, courts, but always doesn\\'t work as it should.  So that prevents right now in Russia to speak freely.  Formally nothing but in reality, a lot of things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Let\\'s talk about MTV.  \"Rebel Music\" as I understand it was an MTV music series whose fundamental principle was to celebrate bands who say difficult things in environments where there might be repercussions.  And as I understand it, your band was chosen for one of seven episodes.\\n\\nLINK:  Correct.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And, in fact, one of your songs was used as the title track for the series.\\n\\nLINK:  So I get a letter from the producer and essentially it says because of political pressure, the Russia episode has been removed from the \"Rebel Music\" series.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  According to the producer, MTV Russia pushed back on the content, she presumes because of the negative impact it would have on them and their ability to do business on a day-to-day basis in Russia.  MTV\\'s official reason for removing Luna from the series is that they simply did not have enough time to air all the stories they filmed.\\n\\nLINK:  This was a documentary series about musicians standing up, and risking their lives in some cases, to stand up against government abuse of power, government corruption, and yet a foreign government was able to editorially control what American viewers see on their TV screens.  That to me is a scandal of epic proportion.  This entire documentary\\'s gone.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Luna\\'s song is the title track to the series, but their episode never happened.\\n\\n(on camera):  The rest of Russia is very, very different than Moscow. I mean, here, you drive around, it\\'s like Bentley, Ferrari, Maserati. You go to buy a pair of shoes, you pick up a Bentley on the way out. You tour a lot in Russia.  What do you see?\\n\\nKAZARIAN:  We see a lot of problems.  We see the level of believing is very low.  There is something in music that unites everybody.  It\\'s something beyond politics.  There\\'s certain energy and this energy is the same in every country, in every city.  We have rock music, we have common people.  We\\'re like you.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nGOTTA:  I\\'m going to the hometown of President Putin.  St. Petersburg. He was born there, started his career.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over0:  The night train to St. Petersburg is one of the great fun things to do in Russia.  Roll on great steel wheels through the night, through dark forests of birch and snow.  Out there in the dark, visible for a second or two at a time, the real Russia, the one most Russians live in.\\n\\nGOTTA:  So Tony, time to enjoy life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on-camera):  The gentle chicken meat.\\n\\nGOTTA:  I need something gentle, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Your seat cushion (ph) and ratatouille.\\n\\nMay I propose a toast?  To gentle chicken meats.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Pro tip.  If the word gentle is used on a menu, avoid those items and stick to the classics, like blini with caviar and cold pickled herring and potatoes and solyanka, the soup of sturgeon, salmon, olives and lemon.\\n\\n(on camera):  Is health care free anymore in this country?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Well, officially, they say free but if you want to get operation within a month, and you can\\'t wait, you won\\'t get it because long line of those.  BOURDAIN:  How about education?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Up to the high school, it\\'s still great.  The quality\\'s not best as it used to be.  People used to get a lot of things for free. Now it\\'s coming to an end.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You asked for capitalism, you got it, buddy.  According to Reaganomics it\\'s the trickle-down theory.  That means if I make lots and lots and lots and lots of money, money will somehow trickle down to you.  You know, my masseur, my garage attendant, my aerobic therapist. They of course will be making money.  I will be buying more things for various wives and prostitutes.  In this way, I don\\'t exactly share the wealth, but I trickle it down and if you don\\'t like your job --\\n\\nGOTTA:  What can you do then?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mopping my feces-splattered walls, cleaning up my dead prostitutes, you can leave your job at Wal-Mart and become a billionaire like me.  Or you go on a reality show and become really, really rich.  Doing nothing.  It\\'s fantastic.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Tony, I\\'m convinced.  I think you know what you are doing in life, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you put on your jammies?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Uh-huh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I just want to state for the record, just because you are in the top bunk, that\\'s no indication of any relationship that we may or may not have.\\n\\nGOTTA:  You and me have to be very careful in public.  If we bring up subject like this, there could be some different repercussions. Tolerance never existed in Russia.  That\\'s why when just recently people started to come out in Russia, like lesbians and gays, they were either fired from their jobs or were given like hard time to exist.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But what about Tchaikovsky?\\n\\nGOTTA:  They try not to acknowledge it by saying he was a great musician, so --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He was a great musician who liked to have sex with other men.\\n\\nGOTTA:  That\\'s what people are not meant to learn in school.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And that\\'s the former palace?\\n\\nGOTTA:  You remember what happened in October of 1917?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody came charging through, charged up the states and looted the Winter Palace.\\n\\nGOTTA:  And (INAUDIBLE) before the judge of government (ph) had to put on his female outfit to escape the revolutionary peasants.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That wouldn\\'t go over well these days.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Right.  Not anymore.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Recently in the run-up to the Sochi Olympics, attention has been drawn to a wave of rabidly homophobic remarks by public officials.  Images of gay and lesbian activists being beaten and harassed in the street, often with official or semi-official consent.  And a new law which claims to forbid promoting homosexual propaganda to minors, but which could be interpreted any way the authorities choose.\\n\\n(on camera):  What\\'s happening here?  What\\'s going on?\\n\\nXENA ROBREK, ARTIST & FILMMAKER:  Oh, my god.  I don\\'t know what\\'s going on.  Every day, I ask myself what\\'s going on, what\\'s going on.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you have to be afraid?\\n\\nROBREK:  No.  I have nothing to lose.  So I can be myself.  I\\'m nobody in social system and I am independent (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Artist and film maker Xena Robrek is a brave young woman.  She\\'s openly gay.  Lately, the actual hunting of gay people has been documented -- violent skinhead gangs who contact gay men and women online, arrange meetings under false pretenses, then violently ambush them.  There have been very few prosecutions.\\n\\nDASHA, TRANSLATOR:  You can get killed for this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Our local fixer, Dasha, helps translate.\\n\\nDASHA:  She had a situation once where the skinheads attacked her on the street.  Not only once.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This new law prohibits propaganda?\\n\\nROBREK:  Amongst minors.  (SPEAKING RUSSIAN)\\n\\nDASHA:  It\\'s like the anti-Soviet propaganda, you can go to jail for anything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It means whatever they want it to mean.\\n\\nDASHA:  Yes.  We -- how many gay families we have, with kids, and those people are in maximum stress right now because their families might be hooligans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  We rightly see this as outrageous.  The Russian public, however, it\\'s very likely a vote-getter.  A cynical pandering to a powerful and enduring vein of deep-seated homophobia that goes way, way back.  (on camera):  What do you think the source of this hatred is?\\n\\nROBREK:  It\\'s not about Russian or the church.  It\\'s about political structure.  It\\'s about power.  We have two Russias.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.  What are they?\\n\\nDASHA:  Big like big bear.  Not very sophisticated but it\\'s an instincts country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK\\n\\nDASHA:  And the other side is the country of intelligent people, thoughtful people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of these political leaders, are they using the issue of gay rights to appeal to a larger audience?\\n\\nROBREK:  They try to play with bear.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, because usually what happens when you play with the bear is tomorrow or the next day or the next day, the bear eats you.\\n\\nROBREK:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are you hopeful?\\n\\nDASHA:  It\\'s about responsibility.  We should never give up.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Farm to table, in Russia?  Organic?  Local? Why, yes.  There are those who are trying. Sergey Shnurov is a very popular musician and leader of the band Leningrad. Leningrad was banned in Moscow purportedly for promoting alcoholism.\\n\\n(on camera):  Cheers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING RUSSIAN)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is Sergey\\'s wife, Matilda.  Together they have opened this restaurant, Cococo, with the mission to bring genuinely local, quality Russian food to diners.\\n\\nMATILDA SHNUROVA:  We opened this restaurant one year ago which will work only with local farmers and we are the first to do it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  In all of Russia.\\n\\nSHNUROVA:  Yes, in all of Russia.\\n\\nTraditional combination, rye bread and Russian fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Chef Igor Grishechkin\\'s version of sushi. Instead of rice, more traditional Russian black bread with sprouts, mackerel, cod liver and salmon caviar.  Old school, but looks new school.\\n\\n(on camera):  When I first came here 2001, the best restaurant in Moscow was a nightmare of French, Japanese ingredients, recipes from nowhere.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everyone hated Russia, wanted to be someone else.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Pearl barley, lightly smoked raw beef topped with quail egg.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Very interesting combination.  Very nice.  What\\'s the most popular thing?  What do people want?\\n\\nSHNUROVA:  The most popular is Italian-Japanese cuisine.  And karaoke.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Sounds like a nightmare.\\n\\nSHNUROVA:  Cheers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  That was good.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Before Putin, before Gorbachev, Khruschev, Stalin and Lenin, there was this.  Imperial Russia.  Mighty palaces spread across the empire where the very, very few lived in unimaginable luxury.\\n\\nGOTTA:  That\\'s Paul, Czar Paul.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  While their people worked and starved.\\n\\n(on camera):  Didn\\'t work out so well for Paul, did it?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Not really.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They choked the dude to death, right?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Actually strangled with a piece of cord.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The czars of previous centuries were certainly living the good life.  Money no object when it came to personal comfort or luxurious lodgings.  And today\\'s imperial powers seem not far behind.  Putin allegedly had a billion dollar palace built for him.  We couldn\\'t license the actual smuggled photo, but our artist rendering looks like this.\\n\\nA Putin spokesman dismissed all this, telling \"The New York Times,\" \"We have Congress halls built for the Kremlin but if you call all of them Putin\\'s palace, it is nothing but absurd.\"\\n\\n(on-camera):  Vodka.  Haven\\'t tasted that before.  So what would I be doing on my outing if I were a czar, looking for cool arts (ph) to oppress?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Something, enjoying life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Picking up some good speed here.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Oh, OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Some suggested that Russia is, after all this time, coming full circle -- a tiny, tiny minority in possession of nearly unlimited power and wealth.\\n\\n(on camera):  The idea of running up the steps and disemboweling royals, I can easily imagine myself doing that.  It would not take much convincing.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Wow.  That\\'s a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I would hurl them all into the sea tomorrow.\\n\\n(voice-over):  After the revolution, in a blood-forced strategy designed to even things out, the government seized private residences, dividing them into little pieces and portioning them out to the masses who were swarming in from the countryside to serve the new industrialized Soviet Union.\\n\\n(on camera):  I never had any ideas of growing up in a socialist wonderland.  Like when I was a brief period when I was a hippie and the idea of living in a commune, not attractive to me.\\n\\nGOTTA:  I was born in a communal flat with three other families, sharing one john, one kitchen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No way.\\n\\nGOTTA:  They would hit me when I had no food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No way.  I share my toilet with no man.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nURI, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  Take the first left, please.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Meet Uri, human rights activist, professor of journalism, one of 26 tenants living in this communal apartment.  An arrangement basically unchanged since Soviet times.\\n\\nURI:  Just in case you change your mind --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And it\\'s here that I see for the first time a glimpse of my friends in the years mysterious past, growing up in a home just like this one.\\n\\nGOTTA:  In Russia, normally people dip yoru bread into this canned shit and like this. BOURDAIN (on camera):  So this was normal for you growing up?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Yes.  I wouldn\\'t drink booze until probably 22 but -- I\\'ll show you how it workings.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So who decided to moved into these places?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Those who were in charge of the specific communal services and residential department would assign x amount to this plan, to that plan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you got to choose your neighbors though?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  I got that.\\n\\nURI (via translator):  In the present day Russia, there has never been a reason to create infrastructure to make people\\'s lives better. Nobody cared about the people that they should have a decent toilet or shower.\\n\\nBOURAIN:  So how is it lately?  Better?  Worse?\\n\\nURI (via translator): So Vladimir Putin changed the whole landscape in the country.  First of all, he started to clamp down on the human rights, on these democratic right.  The most recent laws and changes in the constitution bring up the old Soviet Union type of structure in the country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So what happens next?\\n\\nGOTTA: A year before the Soviet Union collapse, you would never believe in your wildest dreams it would happen.  Nowadays you think it\\'s a similar situation; it looks like stable, people are busy, money is made, rich cars.  But it can\\'t go on like this for too long.  So Uri predicts it could be in a similar overnight collapsing situation.\\n\\nSo there is some hope --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re due for some major renovations.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Just another crisp morning in St. Petersburg.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Yva (ph River, ice fishing paradise.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes?  I wouldn\\'t go out on that, not for a million dollars, man, not now.  It\\'s total unstable.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Lessons of history.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where are we?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Peter and Paul Fortress which used to be a place for the Romanov who are a little  bit executed in 1917.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A little bit?  They were very executed.\\n\\nGOTTA:  How were they found.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Originally built to defend the Swedes -- God I hate those maurading Swedes -- the Peter and Paul Fortress was overrun by the Bolsheviks during the revolution.\\n\\n(on camera):  So the 100-year anniversary of what is coming up?\\n\\nGOTTA:  Great October socialist revolution -- in three years from now. So I smell, with that this disparity gap in the society, very rich and very poor, that someone might bring up the masses back to Winter Palace and storm it again, like 100 years, nothing changed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Every day at noon without fail, this D 30 .122 Howitzer is fired to commemorate the revolution.\\n\\nGOTTA:  Ready to load.  Load it.  Very solemn moment.  Moment of truth, Tony, for you.\\n\\n(BELL TOLLING)\\n\\nGOTTA:  Come up.  One, two, four.\\n\\n(GUN FIRE)\\n\\nGOTTA:  Sweet.  Enemy is destructed.  Congratulations, you are the hero of Russia now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Sweet.\\n\\nGOTTA:  You can\\'t take it on the plane, though.  They won\\'t understand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not even carry on?\\n\\n(voice-over):  Since the filming of this show, a number of things have happened.  Putin\\'s Sochi Olympics, a  blatant exercise of political muscle and a financial boondoggle the size unheard of in history, went off as planned.  Russia won many gold medals, the most of any country in competition, which was really all that mattered.\\n\\nA few journalists complained about the bathrooms, but that is all but forgotten.  More than $50 billion of mostly public money -- gone.\\n\\nUkraine rose up and their despotic pro-Putin president run away.  As if a foregone conclusion, Russia, in broad daylight, has recently annexed the Crimea and, as I\\'m writing this, is massing tens of thousands of troops on the border of Ukraine.\\n\\nThe world has done nothing.  It will do nothing, as Vladimir well knew.  He wins again.\\n\\n',\n",

Put that into the context of throwing away a bottle of 7- Up in a club.  That\\'s we\\'re only slightly more honest about it.\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  You\\'re talking crass commercialism in the very best sense of the word.  This is it.\\n\\nIs this the cultural center of the country?  We may not want to think it is, but is it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is the rest of the country?  I don\\'t know. But it\\'s that place that they all leave and come here.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can go to the desert, but I am not going to get there by accident.  But that\\'s part of the whole experience of the desert is that, you know, it ain\\'t friendly.  It ain\\'t nice.  It ain\\'t good, you know?\\n\\nYou\\'re out here, you know, a half a mile, it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re half a mile out or you\\'re 20 miles out.  There\\'s no reason to walk a mile further.  You\\'re already in infinite desolation.\\n\\nSin City was true, it was real.  Part of moving out here was you were never going to see your family again.  That was it.  I\\'m moving to Vegas and you ain\\'t coming to see me and I ain\\'t coming to see you. That\\'s the character of the city.\\n\\nIt really was, you know, the pit of America.  It wasn\\'t that somebody came out here because I\\'m going to make a million bucks.  It was I\\'m going to come out here and I\\'m going to survive and you all ain\\'t going to bug me anymore back home.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST (voice-over):  In Vegas, there\\'s winners and losers.  And God knows I\\'ve been both.  In a place like this where you can lose your shirt on the unlucky turn of a card, you need a friend.  And for my sins, I got Ruhlman.  Currently evading prosecution in just about every jurisdiction from his hometown, Cleveland, to Grand Forks, wanted for bail jumping, usury, misuse of livestock, assault, grand theft auto, also the respected author of such food related classics as \"The French Lottery Cookbook\" and \"Soul of a Chef,\" he washed up in Vegas at just the right time.\\n\\nVegas was always the most unlikely of dreams, the longest of long shots in the middle of the desert, a real but imaginary space that keeps expanding, creeping ever larger across the wasteland.\\n\\nBack in the \\'40s, the \\'50s, it was a small town; 100,000 became 300,000 became 500,000, then a million, then two.  But it doesn\\'t matter if it was five years ago or 50.  The town has always ended like this, an abrupt cut in the desert racks on the horizon.\\n\\nBut there are comfortable dark places, too, where a man can have a drink meet like-minded sophisticatos of the Open West, places like this.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s the good stuff.

Even more dim than me.  That\\'s hard.\\n\\nYou know what this whole show\\'s about?  You know there\\'s a theme.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is about people who live here, you know.  When all the meatheads come and go, they\\'re still here.  These people have seen every variety of horrifying human behavior.  The old business model was come to Vegas and behave really, really badly.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s encouraged people to be their worst. They\\'re expected to do that.  Kind of makes my skin crawl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not here.  Here, I like it.  I\\'m comfortable here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is this an easy town to make a living or a hard town to make a living?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Depends on what you do, 25 years behind the bar, you see some shit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you were born and bred here --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She\\'s third generation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Third generation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Third generation.

Do you think that basically the human race are good people?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I would say roughly half of them.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Half are going.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Half are going.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hey.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are probably more knuckleheads per square foot in the Vegas Strip than anywhere in America.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, but I\\'m not hanging with those people, man.  There will be a few high end meals during our adventure here.  We will be sampling the other side.  But there\\'s a price.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is always a price with you.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There are places in Vegas where the available rooms are not listed on any websites, places reserved for the whales, the high rollers, the $10 million-a-night gamblers who arrive by private plane.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bobby Flay probably lives like this all the time.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  It could have been dark, couldn\\'t it.  It\\'s very dark here.

You deserve this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re right.  You\\'re right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You deserve this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Entering my golden years era.

I told the casino that Wolf Blitzer was coming, that he was expected any minute.  I suggested that Wolf might be hungry and they sent up Guy Savoy.  Fortunately he doesn\\'t watch a lot of television and I plan to live large until they figure out that Wolf ain\\'t coming.  I\\'ll deal with the fallout later.  But for now, we live.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So gentlemen, this dish is called a collage of caviar, everything is in layers.  In the bottom of the glass you will find caviar vinaigrette, topped with a cream of caviar, then topped with a puree of French green beans with caviar.  Then a Grenaille of golden Szechuan (ph) caviar and which are finishing the dish with a caviar sabayon (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ahh, beautiful.  Look at that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s rare that I say it\\'s too beautiful to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was just thinking that.\\n\\nOh, speaking of fantastically luxurious --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So messieurs, this is a specialty of Mr. Savoy, the (INAUDIBLE) with fresh black truffles and shavings of aged Parmesan cheese.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, man.

That is beautiful.\\n\\nYou feel guilty eating this well?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You do?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m feeling guilty now but it will pass.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I will follow you then.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  You ever even seen anything like this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen anything like this anywhere.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, me either.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the thing is, you can see the main pool in front of the window here.  You can see the hoi polloi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was thinking of inviting them up to our crib for a party.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don\\'t you do dare that.  No. BOURDAIN:  Don\\'t they deserve a good time?  I don\\'t know.  Maybe not.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not going to happen.\\n\\nBOULDEN:  We\\'re getting back to guilt.  Do you feel enlightened and inspired by this meal?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you asking?  What are you getting at here?  You\\'re trying to get at something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Trying to make myself feel better.  I\\'m trying to prove that I\\'m down with the people, man.  I\\'m still cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This guilt keeps coming back.  You keep bringing up the guilt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re right.  I feel guilty.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you doing here if you feel so guilty about it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t.  I don\\'t.  I feel guilty about not feeling guilty.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s more to the point.  Now you\\'re being honest with yourself.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s so easy to say I came out here because it\\'s a lot of opportunity.  Well, that\\'s really great.  If you\\'re not here for that, why else are you here?\\n\\nIt\\'s the good old wreck your life scenario.  That\\'s always pretty popular.  You can change your mind about wrecking your life, now what do I do?  There\\'s a lot less self-reflection about why people are here than there is about most other places.  What a lost opportunity that is.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Sinatra and the Mob are gone but there remains still a certain sentimental attachment to the way things used to be. There were rules then, a way that things were done, and when they weren\\'t done, there was always the desert and a hole in the ground.\\n\\nAlso, there were lounges and rub joints and places where a man could get a proper plate of Italian American meatballs and spaghets. Thankfully there are still such places, places like this, The Bootlegger.\\n\\nIt\\'s a family operation.  Mama Maria\\'s family has been running it for 41 years.  You got your veal parm, your fettuccini Alfredo, your steaks and shrimps.  Don\\'t forget the iceberg wedge with the bleu cheese, which believe me, you want.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to The Bootlegger.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nLAURA SCHAFER (PH), SINGER:  Thank you very much.  This is Charlie Schafer (ph), my esteemed father.  My name is Laura Schafer (ph) and we are your entertainment for the evening.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The Bootlegger has the reputation for being a locals joint and it is but there\\'s a lot of out-of-towners, too, sentimental fools like me who, if they don\\'t miss Sinatra, definitely miss Dino and Louis Prima and Keely Smith.\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  When I was 19, I got my first show on the strip and it was a small casino which is not there anymore now, now it\\'s been imploded for something newer, bigger and better.\\n\\nWhat I do, anyway, it\\'s part jazz, part nostalgia, but obviously I do it with a heavy dose of nostalgia because I\\'m recreating the whole look, not just singing the old songs, which is what makes it fun for me.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pick one, Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra.  You get to see one of them live in a small room like this.\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  Frank Sinatra.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m going with Dino.\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  I like Dino as a person better because I\\'ve never heard anybody say anything bad about him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whereas Sinatra, you would have a hard time hearing something good.\\n\\nThere does seem to be a sound track to Old Vegas.\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  A sound track --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Does that help?\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  Who, me?  Or any other entertainers?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, an affection for the classics.  An expectation that while I\\'m here, I should hear some standards.\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  I don\\'t know if there\\'s a certain place that people stay who are sentimental about Las Vegas because there are very few hotels left that were there in the old days.  They have all been imploded. BOURDAIN:  They recreated Ancient Rome sort of and the Amalfi Coast and Paris.  You would think somebody would want to recreate Vegas.  I would go there.\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  I would work there.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nSCHAFER (PH):  Thank you very much.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nPENN JILLETTE, ENTERTAINER:  You used to be able to go see Louis Prima, 3:00 am, have breakfast and then go out and watch an atomic bomb explode in the distance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That sounds like a good time.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  That\\'s the time I would like to live in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Was it better before?  Is it better now?  Is it different?\\n\\nJILLETTE:  It\\'s better to talk about before.  People loved having their Mob stories and there\\'s that weird romance of bad people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  I don\\'t think it actually was better.  I think it was really good if you were Sinatra.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Penn Jillette, another cog in the entertainment machine, though at a somewhat more elevated level.  Of the live acts left in Vegas, his might be the biggest draw.\\n\\nI suggested this place because Raku off the Strip is where every chef I know who knows this town said I should go.\\n\\nThe Japanese modern izakaya, known as one of the best places to eat in Vegas, casual but pricey, pricey because the ingredients, many from around the world.  There is sea urchin from Santa Barbara.  OK, that\\'s not too far, but good.\\n\\nThe tuna is from Spain, where it\\'s best.  The fresh river crab from Japan.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  That was good, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Delicious.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  I didn\\'t know oysters came that big.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Hasaki sashimi, hasaki belly, juicy deep-fried chicken, hamachi belly and one of my favorites, fish collar, where all the best, tastiest, moistest, meatiest bits hide their favors.  Penn has been living here and performing here for over 20 years.  He knows.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  The thing about magic is, you cannot see it electronically. Many people come to Vegas are people that see one or two live shows a year and if you see one or two live shows, you might as well see something that you can only see live.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  You can never, ever see a magician anyway but live.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These days for better or worse, live acts, live performers, are being squeezed out in favor of EDM, electronic dance music.  It\\'s a deejay\\'s world and where once they used to say cocaine was God\\'s way of telling you had too much money, now maybe EDM is.\\n\\nJILLETTE:  We get invited to all the openings of the new clubs but I simply don\\'t understand it.  And I\\'m embarrassed that I don\\'t understand it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are we just old?\\n\\nJILLETTE:  I think that might be it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or are non-juicy (ph)?\\n\\nJILLETTE:  I don\\'t know.  You want to spin it the latter, I\\'m afraid it might be the former.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Used to be a whole spectrum of entertainers who existed almost entirely in Vegas.  Danny Ganz was huge here. Wayne Newton.  They were gods.\\n\\nBut what\\'s the big money draw now?  This.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Come, ye lords and princelings of douchedom (ph), here my clarion call.  Anointed thyself with gel and heavenly body spray.  Maketh the sign of the devil horns with thine hands.  Let there be high-fiving and the hugging of many bros, for this is the kingdom and the power.  Now frolic and maketh it to rain.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve got this.  Power.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, man, it\\'s crazy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just press a button and people respond.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They do, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Wednesday night at The Marquee.  Deejay Jason Lima works for the house.  Tonight at Marquee and at other clubs like it around Vegas, somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 people are going to stop by and drop a whole buttload of cash. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s not just coming in here and ordering a bottle and sitting there drinking it.  You\\'re getting a full-on group experience.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The new money, the new Vegas, where the take at the big nightclubs is outpacing the take from gambling and slots, where everybody for the right price and with enough sparkles and the right mix can be a winner.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After you finish work, how long does it take for your adrenaline to level off?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At least an hour.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What are your dreams like now?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m not going to lie.  Sometimes I close my eyes and I still see the strobes, ears are ringing, I\\'ve still got like flash of the strobe lights.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nOSCAR GOODMAN, FORMER MAYOR, LAS VEGAS:  Las Vegas is an adult playland.  And that\\'s what we intend to be.  If people want to see Mickey Mouse, they can go 175 miles down the road.  If they want to see Bugsy Siegel under a rock, they stay here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Is there a Mr. Vegas like Elvis or Wayne Newton or Bugsy Siegel used to be?\\n\\nIf there is, it would probably be this guy, former mayor Oscar Goodman, a man who knows allegedly and to the best of my knowledge where all the bodies are buried, some of them equally allegedly by some of his former clients.\\n\\nWe meet over drinks at Oscar\\'s, the steakhouse that bears his name and boasts beef, booze and broads.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve got some colorful clients.\\n\\nWho was nice and who was less fun to have a...?\\n\\nGOODMAN:  Well, the truth of the matter is, all my clients were nice to me because I kept them out of prison.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did alleged mob guys know how to eat?\\n\\nGOODMAN:  My mother used to say two things, she said.  She was the greatest lady.  She said Oscar\\'s clients don\\'t hurt anybody, they just kill each other.  And she also said Oscar\\'s clients take us to the best restaurants.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They knew where to go.\\n\\nGOODMAN:  They knew where to go.  Yes.  And were always treated right. They were always treated like kings and queens.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did the Feds hold it against you?  You were just doing your job.\\n\\nGOODMAN:  They didn\\'t see it that way.  They thought I was a consigliere.  As a matter of fact, in order to murder somebody, they had to get my permission.  That\\'s how stupid these people were.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Anthony \"The Ant\" Spilatro (ph), Meyer Lansky (ph), these were gentlemen not unknown to Mayor Goodman.\\n\\nGOODMAN:   A lot of people will tell you it was a better place when the Mob was running it.  In many ways, that\\'s true.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There were rules then that mattered.  You know the old saying, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Back when the Mob ran things, there was a certain urgency to that suggestion.\\n\\nGOODMAN:  Always talking about with Prince Harry, that\\'s a perfect example.  Here\\'s a guy who was here having a good time.  In the Old Vegas, that would never have happened.  There would never have been a disclosure.  In today\\'s modern age, it was all over the world in moments.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Moments.\\n\\nGOODMAN:  Yes.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It says something about the town that his honor served three terms as mayor.  He\\'s an unabashed booster, entrepreneur, drinker of hard liquor and gambler and he was never shy about admitting it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s unique.  It\\'s its own hothouse environment.\\n\\nGOODMAN:  That\\'s what Vegas is.  Vegas is unique.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll tell you one thing, you go to the airport here, everybody is smiling.  When they come in, they\\'re smiling.  They can\\'t wait to lose their money and then when they leave, they\\'re smiling after they\\'ve lost their money.  So I think it\\'s very, very special, a special place kind of place that people can take their basest instincts and just let it fly.  I think that\\'s good.  I have no problem with that at all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When you come to Vegas, you see this, the lights and smoke and mirrors, the casino floors.\\n\\nBut who manages the machine?  Where do they come from?\\n\\nBeneath the floors, behind the walls, above the winking surveillance camera lenses, a whole other world manned by thousands and thousands of waiters, maintenance people, repairmen, chefs, engineers, plumbers and croupiers. Three shifts a day they slip in and out of the casinos almost unseen through their own entrances, but it\\'s these people who have seen it all, seen everything, night after night.\\n\\nBenny (ph) has been working here since Caesar\\'s opened in August of 1966.  He\\'s dealt cards to everybody.\\n\\nBENNY (PH), CROUPIER:  I\\'ve dealt to Diana Ross, Harry Belafonte, Sinatra, Sammy Davis.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sinatra was not supposed to be particularly amiable at the table.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Sinatra was class.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  He was class.  He was a gentleman.  But those were the days.  But it\\'s nice now, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Would you describe yourself as a degenerate gambler?\\n\\nERIC LINDGREN (PH), PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER:  I definitely have been. I\\'m trying to move past that.  We have a 2-year-old at home.  So I\\'m working in that phase, but I\\'ll always have that gambling gear, there\\'s no doubt about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Eric and Erica Lindgren (ph) are professional gamblers, poker players, to be precise.  It\\'s routine for them to sit down to a game with a bankroll of half a million dollars.  Tonight, slightly smaller stakes.\\n\\nERIC LINDGREN (PH):  Hey, Benny, what are -- how do you like my chances?\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Good.  Good.\\n\\nERICA LINDGREN (PH), PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER:  That\\'s a trained answer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Instead of actual poker, we are set up with a dumbed down for the camera version of Texas hold \\'em.  You play against the house.  The odds, to say the least, are stacked against you.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Oh, here\\'s a winner.  Here\\'s a winner.  Two pair.  He\\'s cutting up over there.  See how easy it is?  You got this game down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-oh.  Those are famous last words.\\n\\nERIC LINDGREN (PH):  All right.  Let\\'s put out a hondo, let\\'s see what happens.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  All right.  Now we have a pair of 7s.\\n\\nERIC LINDGREN (PH):  I want to bet.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  OK.  I have trips.  That\\'s going to be pretty hard to beat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re a dead man, Benny.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  I\\'m a dead man.\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  I\\'ll bet again.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  OK.  Two pair.  Pair of deuces.  Two pair.  Pair of 10s.\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  Oh, no.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Pair of kings.\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  Benny!\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Full house.\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  Goodness, Benny.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Huh?\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  You got a full house.  This is unbelievable.  Is there a cooler standing behind us?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.  That works for me.\\n\\nBENNY (PH):  Thank you very much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is what we call a learning experience in my case.\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  That was fun.  We got away with our shirts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s not do it again.\\n\\nERIC LINDREN (PH):  Let\\'s never do it again.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nANTHONY BONDI (PH), ARTIST:  It\\'s easy to find people that will help you untangle the mess, but somebody\\'s got to be the one to create the mess in the first place.\\n\\nIt\\'s called untangling.\\n\\nWhere\\'s our metaphor here?  Easy to tangle, but untangle this.  This is going to be so much fun.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Anthony Bondi is an artist and a born and bred Las Vegas native.  After many adventures and I\\'m guessing some misadventures as well, he chose to live here.\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  To what degree am I complicit in the worst of our city by making art that glorifies the city?\\n\\nI don\\'t profit directly from what those people do but, of course, I do, because I live in the city and as that money rolls all around us.  But how do we live with it?  It\\'s not what why and where the people come from who do the grotesque things people do here.  It\\'s how do we live here complicit in it.  That\\'s the big issue is be able to be self-reflective about the place or you have to go and stay high all the time because of the shame.\\n\\nI mean, you know, which is another popular way to deal with living here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is Vegas a friendly town?\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  Yes, always friendly, because that\\'s our job.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean to itself.  You\\'re a local.\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  Not a bit.  This town has never had any respect whatsoever for the people who just happened to live here.  In the old days, we were co-conspirators in those days.  We weren\\'t citizens. The new authority, the new power is exactly as anonymous as the old power.  No poll number, no access.  It\\'s not a fan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Though it\\'s been for some years an art community in Vegas, you know, like art that makes your life, all our lives, better and makes us think.\\n\\nGranted, Vegas is a town designed to make you not think, just separate you from your money in as pleasurable a way as possible, so pleasurable that even after you limp out of town leaking from your ass, with nothing in your pockets, you want to come back and do it again.  Reflection, not so good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As a resident, what are the general rules of survival?\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  Don\\'t cry about being broke.  If I\\'m broke, more than likely it\\'s because I threw away my money and too bad for me because I didn\\'t get lucky.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t complain about being broke.  OK.\\n\\nWhat\\'s another one?\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  Well, smile.  That is absolutely a local characteristic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is a service industry town.\\n\\nBONDI (PH):  One of our roles here has always been to take away excess money from people who don\\'t know what to do with it and who can\\'t think of a better idea about how to spend their money.  We\\'ll always take it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that worse than before?  BONDI (PH):  The wrong is there are people with that kind of income who could put it to so many thrilling uses and can think of nothing so crass and boring than to wave the money in the air and throw it away.\\n\\nHow loathsome, but within us, within those of us who live here is that challenge.  This has always been.  Here we are.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  You are sitting in Lotus Siam, the best Thai restaurant in Vegas by far.  And one of the best Thai restaurants in America.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Jet Tila (ph) has been here before.  An L.A. guy, he came out here to do four years as executive chef at Encore, a Wynn (ph) casino on the strip.  He\\'s a reigning authority on Thai food but really, everybody who loves Thai food knows about this place.\\n\\nJET TILA (PH), EXECUTIVE CHEF, ENCORE:  What you should order here should only be northern.  You go to the back of the menu, it\\'s northern specialties.  You come here and eat chicken with cashew nuts and drunken noodles, I\\'m going to punch you in the face.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  It\\'s one of those restaurants.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Sipend Shutuma (ph) is the owner and chef. Now get this.  And it\\'s important.  You don\\'t do pad Thai here.  You do what they are uniquely superb at, which is specifically the food of Northern Thailand.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Num trik (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes, yes, of course, love it.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  The literal translation, chili dip.  It\\'s really more of like a composed room-temperature salad.\\n\\nNam koa ta (ph) is a puffed crispy rice salad with preserved pork sausage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s good.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  Jackfruit salad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jackfruit salad.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  This is hung leh, a pork curry braised down with garlic and ginger.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This pork is amazing.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  Isn\\'t that great?  And that\\'s northern love.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right. TILA (PH):  Very important dish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that looks really pretty.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  This is kow soy (ph), this is the food my grandma made.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s perfection, man.\\n\\nTILA (PH):  What I love about Vegas Asian food is on one street you have the best Szechuan food, the best Cantonese food, you drive down the street and you get the best Thai food.  It\\'s a funky, awesome Asian --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did that happen?\\n\\nTILA (PH):  Gambling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean, were there high rollers who would come into town --\\n\\nTILA (PH):  A dude with a $2 million to $10 million credit line who wins is going to go eat a $10 Chinese meal because it\\'s the closest thing he has to home food.  I\\'m going to go eat Asian food, I\\'m going to come back and I\\'m going to drop $5 million more and then go home.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is what avant garde cooking is.  People think that we want to do things in a way because we want to be cool.  No. We do it because really, we believe we are increasing the value of the product we are working with.  We are giving you the essence.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  E by Jose Andres, tonight, three seats, tucked away in the back of another of Jose\\'s restaurants, Paella (ph), behind the guys making paella over open flame in the center of a crowded dining room. Quiet, serene, a kind of magic.\\n\\nThis is, granted, a far cry from the $1 shrimp cocktail and the all- you-can-eat buffets groaning under the weight of a thousand cars. Iberico ham and bean soup with black and roasted garlic.  Come on, baby, the world\\'s best, like from Espain.\\n\\nNitro almond cup, a frozen shell made from a puree of Marcona almonds, filled with almond milk espuma and finished with Andalusian caviar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, Chef, this meal is working very well.  My palate is open, I\\'m intrigued, I\\'m only growing more hungry and excited.  The desired effect is taking hold.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If you were a famous chef and you were lured as so many are to the rivers of green promised by Vegas, it\\'s nice if you can get yourself a playroom.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gentlemen, this is al vermuz (ph). BOURDAIN:  So this is mussels, olives with an escabeche foam.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He doesn\\'t use the word foam.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say air.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Water goes all over the place.  It\\'s a mess.  A chef cannot do anything with these.  Air gives us opportunity, all of a sudden, water is not water anymore.  Water has a body, belongs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The truffle egg, a gelee of truffles formed into an egg shape with an actual yolk suspended in the center.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And this is the idea of what if we will be feeding our chickens truffles?  Will their eggs become like this?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Served with onion puree, a decheval (ph) cream and finished with more -- lots more -- shaved white truffle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is crispy chicken skin escabeche.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m sliding this off right into my face.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gentlemen, this is your portion of the salt- roasted foie gras and Brian is going to come finish it with a clementine sauce for you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Light is key, light and flavorful.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gentlemen, this is your next course.  It\\'s alcucheres al papillote (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is squid ink (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a secreto de cerdo en papillote (ph). Secreto or the secret.  It\\'s a secret cut of the Iberian --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ahh, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- located underneath the front shoulder.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is an homage of the goodness of the sea meets the goodness of the Earth.\\n\\nYou know the work that goes into creating a menu like this?  Colossal. The good with the work doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.  When a food creates, they come.\\n\\nAnd they say the chef was not there.  And then look at the food critics saying it\\'s almost like a lack of respect.\\n\\nWho do you think these people are?  Where do you think they come from? What do you think their careers are?  Every one of those amazing thousands of chefs, sous chefs that we have across the world, they are as good, if not better, than the guys that have the big name on top with me on letter.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is not one acre of preserved Mojave Desert in the city limits of Las Vegas.\\n\\nWhy would you preserve this?  This desolation is not nurturing.  We can\\'t be here unless there\\'s a lot of technology supporting our presence.  And so there\\'s a sense of the city versus nature.  This is not our friend.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You would think looking at the vast lakes, the canals, the fountains of Vegas in the middle of a desert, the flush of 100,000 toilets that the casinos and what they bring would constitute an obscene waste of water.\\n\\nAnd indeed water is at an ever-more desperate premium as the water levels in the Colorado River reservoir at Lake Mead decrease at an alarming rate.\\n\\nBut it ain\\'t the casinos that are the culprits.  In fact, Vegas casinos are a model of water efficiency and conservation.\\n\\nMain culprit?  The all-American lawn, a little square of green.\\n\\nRobert Kern (ph) is water police.  He patrols the Vegas streets looking for evidence of water violations.\\n\\nROBERT KERN (PH):  There\\'s finally some water in the gutter actually on both sides.  This is not their day.\\n\\nWe\\'re in an area where there shouldn\\'t be any water, yet there\\'s water here.  So that\\'s what we do, we drive around looking for something like that, to give them a little educational visit.  Hey, you\\'re not supposed to water today.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you don\\'t wrestle them to the ground, cuff them and drag them in?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  No, we do not.  Although we can go to a fee.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Around how much?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  $80.\\n\\nWhat about the --\\n\\nKERN (PH):  Then it doubles, $160, $320.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Then it just keeps going?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It seems to me a losing battle to try to keep your grass green.\\n\\nDo you really need a lawn in the first place?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  Well, most everyone who lives here came from the Midwest or the East Coast and it was all lush and green.  And that\\'s what Vegas was 20 years ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was lush and green?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  Sure.  Sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The city assigns watering days to control usage, and also encourages xeriscaping, a landscaping style focused on drought-resistant plants and efficient irrigation.\\n\\nAnd if you don\\'t get with the program, there\\'s a hole out there in the desert for you, Dad.  OK, not really.  You get a notice pinned to your door or something.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But some people, they want the lawn?  Got to have it?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  And they can have it, just don\\'t water on the wrong days.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How critical is it?\\n\\nKERN (PH):  Very.  I mean, there\\'s no snow on the Western Sierras, so we don\\'t get any continued flow into the Colorado dumping into Lake Mead.  So unless something drastically changes, which there is no foreseeable relief in the near future.  But got to stay positive.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For the first 30-40 years of the development of the tract, you just couldn\\'t conceive of what was ahead.\\n\\nWhat we had, whatever was the newest thing that was happening was so spectacular and wonderful and, oh, my gosh, we\\'ve reached a new eastern edge, or western, a northern edge.\\n\\nBut the odds are slim to zero that we\\'re going to extend it to yet a further horizon.  It was unconceivable.  So there\\'s the thing.  So what does the desert do?  It exceeds our ambition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In Vegas, nothing is permanent.  It constantly eats itself, tears down, builds up, expands according to no known or easily understood plan, an organic thing responding to the dark dreams of the American subconscious.\\n\\nCome frolic, live like Caesar or make money off those who do.  Drop a few moist bills in a gas station slot.  See the full spectrum of human folly and commit some follies of your own.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  Chances are you haven\\'t been to this place.  Chances are this is a place you\\'ve never seen. Other than maybe blurry cell phone videos, old black-and-white newsreels from World War II.  Chances are bad things were happening in the footage you saw.\\n\\nMyanmar, after 50 years of nightmare, something unexpected is happening here, and it\\'s pretty incredible.\\n\\nIn Yangon, the capital city of Myanmar, it\\'s dark.  Blackouts are frequent, with the ancient power grid.  But sources of light there are in the street cast an eerie yellow-orange hue.  For almost 100 years under British rule, this was Rangoon.  In 1948 after helping the British fight off the Japanese, and with the new taste for self- determination, the country gained independence.\\n\\nAfter a decade of instability, however, the military consolidated power and never let go.  Elections?  They came and went.  The results ignored, opposition punished, or silenced entirely.\\n\\nBurma, now Myanmar, where Orwell had once served as a colonial policeman, where he\\'d first grown to despise the apparatus of a security state, became more Orwellian than even he could have imagined.  A nation where even having an opinion could be dangerous.\\n\\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I am very honored to be here at this university and to be the first president of the United States of America to visit your country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Morning in Yangon, to nearly everyone\\'s surprise, there have been some huge changes in recent months.\\n\\nAUNG SAN SUU KYI, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  Difficult time in any transition is when we think that success is in sight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nobel Prize-winning democracy champion, Aung San Suu Kyi, for nearly 15 years under house arrest, was released, and is now taking an active part in politics.\\n\\nJust as the the doors are opening, my crew and I are among the first to record what has been unseen for decades by most of the world. Meanwhile, this Southeast Asian country of 80 million people is collectively holding its breath, waiting to see what\\'s next, and will this loosening of government grip last?\\n\\nOf course, morning in Yangon has always been about tea.  It\\'s black Indian-style tea, usually with a thick dollop of sweetened condensed milk.  You want it sweet, less sweet, very sweet?  Strong? Less strong?  Everybody\\'s got a preference, everybody\\'s got a preferred tea shop, where they know presumably how you like yours.\\n\\nTHIHA SAW, JOURNALIST:  I want only last week a bit strong.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Journalist and publisher Thiha Saw, we meet at the Seit Taing Kya tea shop.\\n\\nSAW:  Anything could happen in a tea shop.  This place means a lot of things.  Not just a place to grab some snacks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For 50 years of paranoia and repression, teahouses were also the main forum for guarded and not-so guarded discussions of the daily news, where you tried to piece together the real stories behind the ludicrously chopped and censored newspapers.  But carefully, of course, because informers and secret police were also heavily represented in these hotbeds of sedition and discontent.\\n\\n(On camera):  So given your profession, how have you managed to stay out of prison all of these years?\\n\\nSAW:  No, I was there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  How long?\\n\\nSAW:  Two times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Two times.\\n\\nSAW:  Once special Burma Police called me, hey, U Thiha Saw, would you please come into the office?  We need to talk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSAW:  So I went over there, and -- I was there 89 days in prison. It was a very serious control that came with the first government.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSAW:  First scrutiny and registration so --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That doesn\\'t sound good.\\n\\nSAW:  And take a look at everything.  They say, take this out, take it down or black this out, or just take the whole story out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Magazines that would come into the country would -- they\\'d cut, literally cut out the pieces?\\n\\nSAW:  People under this kind of tight censorship, it will become more, I think, creative.  Take a look, careful reading, something between the lines.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSAW:  Know it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, something you were accused of, sending secret messages?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  In the back, a cauldron of salty little fish bubble over hardwood coals.  Fingers work mountains of sweet bean, one of the fillings for the variety of pastries that are stuffed, shaped and put into an old wood stove oven.\\n\\nIn another corner, the heartening slap of fresh bread pressed against the clay wall of a tandoori and of course eggs bobs and spins in the magical held broth of fish, spice and herb.\\n\\n(On camera):  Mohinga?  This I must have.  Correct me if I\\'m wrong, if there\\'s a national dish, a fundamental most beloved fish, would it be -- would it be this?\\n\\nSAW:  Yes, you take a look at all this stuff.  These is Indian, these are Chinese, et cetera, but then mohinga is a local thing.  And it\\'s probably found in the city but also in the rural areas, too. It\\'s fish based with some rice or noodles, sometimes we put in some crispies, like fried beans, or fried (INAUDIBLE).  So these are some coriander leaves.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nSAW:  And some lime.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sprinkle some in here.  Good textures.  Particularly in the light of Obama\\'s recent visit, these are interesting times. Significant changes for the first time in 50 years.\\n\\nSAW:  Yes.  That\\'s one thing that\\'s quite significant.  You take a look around, all kinds of people, all age groups.  I think a couple of years ago, people would be talking about politics, you toned down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSAW:  And you (INAUDIBLE).  But nowadays, people are just more outspoken.  The government is much more open.  They also are relaxing the rules about censorship.  August 20th, we were called into the PSRD office, many publishers and editors, and the director general of the (INAUDIBLE), the boss, OK, 48 years and 20 days of censorship is gone. That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Feel good?\\n\\nSAW:  Yes.  That\\'s what we\\'ve been waiting for so many years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I love the answer.  It\\'s a careful yes.\\n\\nSAW:  Yes.  First people in the country, we have some doubt about it.  OK, is it real?  The changes and the reforms?  But as now it\\'s about a couple of years.  And then now people starting to believe, OK, maybe it\\'s real.  The process is still very young, but it\\'s still possible.  When the generals stop and say, OK, enough and enough, let\\'s turn back or let\\'s stop.  I\\'m optimistic about the changes and the reforms.  But you\\'re still cautiously optimistic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  In Yangon, motor bikes are outlawed.  Why is a matter of much rumor and speculation, so it\\'s the bus for me. Something seems almost out of sync.  Not too long ago, even filming here officially as an open professional Western film crew, would have been unthinkable.\\n\\nIn 2007, a Japanese journalist was shot point-blank and killed filming a street demonstration.  Be seen talking to anybody with a camera and there would likely be a knock on your door in the middle of the night.  Yet so far confronted with our cameras, a few smiles, and mostly indifference at worst, shocking considering how recently the government has started to relax its grip.\\n\\nMA THANEGI, LOCAL FOOD WRITER:  We love to eat.  And don\\'t forget for 15 years, we were under two dictatorships, and officially under socialism.  There were not a lot of things to do.  But you know, cook and get shampoo and eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Ma Thanegi, a famous and very controversial figure in public life.\\n\\n(On camera):  Myanmar or Burma?\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Myanmar, because that\\'s the original name since the 13th century.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This Ma Thanegi, like U Thiha Saw, has also spent time in prison.  But emerging after three years, she became in the minds of many an apologist for the regime.  Fairly or not, I leave to others.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Sometimes, outside, I just act as if, you know, it\\'s only after the military junta went away that, you know, things happen, especially with the state like (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But her many well-known books on the culinary traditions of Myanmar make her a compelling advocate for Burmese cuisine.\\n\\n(On camera):  So you\\'re very passionate about the cooking and the cuisine here and the --\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Of course.  It\\'s just that I like to eat.  And I eat like a pig.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is Yangon\\'s Feel restaurant.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Salads I think are the best of our food.  I\\'m going to order a lot of salads you haven\\'t had.  You know, it\\'s good to be like sort of a tasting thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was pig head salad with kaffir lime leaf, long beans salad with sesame and fish sauce.  Penny leaf salad, even this salad of Indian-style samosa.\\n\\n(On camera):  Everything is out there at the same time.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No first court or second course?\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  No.  No, no, no.  If I\\'m invited to a friend\\'s house, the table would be covered with dishes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Covered.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And it\\'s really about the interaction between a lot of colors, textures and flavors in one dish or --\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Different.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, I\\'m in love.  That\\'s good.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Yes.  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And of course, there\\'s the maddeningly delicious condiments and pickles of which to make each dish your own.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  You make a lot of different combinations with each mouthful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is something very confusing in general in this part of the world, everyone eats everything differently to very much to their taste.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Anything goes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Anything goes.\\n\\nMA THANEGI:  Every mouthful, you can make a different flavor.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Credit cards accepted almost nowhere. Cash machines, uh-uh.  Wifi?  Internet?  Rare.  3G , you\\'ve got to be kidding.  If you need to exchange money here, only crisp, absolutely new $100 bills accepted.  In Myanmar, it\\'s another older world.\\n\\nOh, and what\\'s up with this?\\n\\n(On camera):  With all kissing sounds, that smooching, kissing, you know, sound that you\\'re hearing all over the place?  My wife would have been in like 10 fights so far.  Sorry, who are you smooching at? Bitch.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  This is how you summon a waiter in Myanmar.  I know.  I know.  Try that at Hooters, and you would be rightly ejected. It takes some getting used to, for sure.\\n\\n(INAUDIBLE) is a big noisy seafood house where fished prepared in the style of Yakan, the coastal province to the west named for the Yakan people.  One of over 135 distinct ethnic groups around here.\\n\\n(On camera):  See, now we\\'re talking.  Prawn curry is one of those -- one of those things that we\\'re told you\\'ve got to eat here. Prawns from the river, then tomato curry.  Try this.  Good sauce. That\\'s good.  That is some good shit, my friends.  We shall know them by the number of their dead.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Early morning in Yangon.  Among the crush of commuters, shoppers, people trying to make a living, rise up the last remnants of empire.  Faded, often crumbling, but still there after all these years.  These are the offices, businesses, and public buildings of the British colonials.\\n\\nThe Sofaer building was once one of the swankest department stores in Rangoon.  A century ago in Kipling\\'s poem, \"Mandalay,\" was beckoning the over-heated imaginations of a generation of young Englishmen.  Here you could buy fine Egyptian cigarettes, French liqueurs.  The floor tiles were shipped over from Manchester.\\n\\nNow people live here.  A half centuries of a pariah state has left very few of these buildings in good repair.  And there are divergent views on whether to preserve them.  For many a reminder of colonial subjugation, for others, a vest inch of a golden time.\\n\\nThese days in Myanmar in the streets, on the docks, it\\'s all about moving forward.  In an economy ripe to explode if things continue trending in their current direction, the busy hustle and bustle of Yangon\\'s port appears even busier today as workers prepare for the oncoming holiday.\\n\\nPHILIP LAJAUNIE, FRIEND:  Hey, Chef.  How are you doing?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It figures, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  It does.  Welcome to Myanmar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Philip Lajaunie, owner and proprietor of my old restaurant Les Halles.\\n\\n(On camera):  It seems only natural that you\\'d be in Burma, Myanmar at the same time as me.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Back before anything, before I wrote the book that changed my life from broke ass utility grave chef to whatever it is I am today, I\\'d never been to Asia until this guy sent me to Japan, and got me hooked on a continent.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  There we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh, nice.  Chicken head, yes.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  That is the perfect mood awakener.       BOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Philip travels constantly.  He\\'s been bouncing around Asia for decades.  Like all good travelers he\\'s relentlessly curious, and without fear or prejudice.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  It\\'s fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It makes perfect sense then that over cold brew and chicken necks in the port of Yangon, Philip is the one joining me to explore this particular moment in Myanmar.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  That\\'s the (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It is going to be a party.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Full moon party tonight.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWhat\\'s that means, we have no idea.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  We don\\'t know.  There\\'s only one way to find out, I suppose.  It sounds like a party.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It gets crazy from now on.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  It\\'s Kason Day, Full Moon Day, a holiday marking the end of the rainy season.  And today marks the beginning of three days of breakout the crazy.  Giant speakers compete for attention. Everybody cheerfully oblivious to the distortion.  Cotton candy, trinkets, tube socks, just like a New York street fair, but with infinitely better food.\\n\\n(On camera):  These are the little birds?\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Yes.  These guys are really good.  Just flying -- this morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s the backbone of every street fair in the world, isn\\'t it?  Deep fried food.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  That\\'s right.  And here they also have the little butter where they break a quail egg in it.  One shot, it\\'s pretty good.  All right.  This is so tasty.  Much greasy than I thought it would be.  And quite delicate.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Anytime you tell me crispy little bird, I\\'m all over it.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Good beak, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good beak.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Crispy and tender.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, and they have rides.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Check this out.  OK.  It\\'s a Ferris wheel, but the power source, not unusual for these parts, is not electric, it ain\\'t gas.\\n\\n(On camera):  Oh, man, are you kidding me?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  It\\'s human power.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Yes.  See it to believe it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  An absolutely insanely dangerous closely choreographed process of first getting the the giant heavily laden wheel in motion and then getting it up to top speed and keeping it there.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow.  Look at this thing tilting out, too.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Another break.  Then it goes the other way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Note the footwear, by the way.  And it\\'s not just this one, every coming blocks bigger and bigger Ferris wheels, each one with its own troupe of acrobatic spinners.  For sure, going for a ride is tempting, but --\\n\\n(On camera):  CNN host implicated in death of four underage carnies.  The thing just came off the hinges the next thing you know it\\'s rolling down the street and sending those kids flying.  If I had any idea, I never would have taken the ride, says Bourdain.  No, I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Hard making a buck, but again and again, the seats are loaded with smiling families, the team climbs aboard and the circus begins again.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good luck, may you return safely with all of your limbs intact.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Next day in the Full Moon Festival. Whether you\\'re looking out the window at a rural village or at the streets of Yangon, what\\'s happening is probably pretty similar, a tableau of dancing, body painting, car mounted speakers blasting.  But it\\'s also three days of merit accruing, the practice of performing charitable or otherwise good works in the hopes of jacking up your karma.\\n\\nMoney trees are paraded around, pinwood cash donations for months.  Free banquets and feasts are held.  And many moments of spiritual reflection.  The majority of people here practice Tera Vata Buddhism, the oldest, most conservative form of the religion, which simply puts, asserts that existence is pretty much a continuous cycle of suffering through birth, death and rebirth.\\n\\n(On camera):  Noisy.\\n\\nZARNI BO, ACTIVIST/LOCAL ASTROLOGER:  Very noisy.  Very noisy, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The Morning Star Teahouse where I\\'ve come, well, for a couple of reasons.  Reason one, the must-have bone deep, old school favorite around here, La Pet Tuk.  The salad of fermented tea leaves.  I know, that does not sound good, but you\\'d be wrong to think that.\\n\\nTake the fermented tea leaves, add cabbage, tomatoes, lots and lots of crunchy bits like toasted peanuts, season with lime and fish sauce.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is absolutely delicious.\\n\\nZARNI BO:  You like it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.  It\\'s fantastic.\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Yes, yes, fantastic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Simple, delicious, things not to be taken for granted if you\\'ve been in and out of the joint like this guy, Zarni Bo, activist, astrologer and three times convict.\\n\\n(On camera):  You know, everyone I\\'ve met in this country so far, in fact, has been to prison.\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Yes.  This happens again and again for us in Myanmar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For almost six years?\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Six years.  Nearly six years.  All the judgments are made by the kangaroo court and navy, army, and the air force.  These three officials sitting all together, they read off, this is your sentence.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZARNI BO:  It happens only minutes, like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is life like inside prison?\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Nice, nice, very nice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have a hard time believing that.\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Very nice.  We can talk to each other, you know, say something, use a mirror to look at each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Access to books?\\n\\nZARNI BO:  No books.  No writing things, no paper.  No, nothing at all.  A mat and a blanket and a plate and a bowl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Only these are things that we possess.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How is the food?\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Think about that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The food in prison?\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Soup.  Rice with pea soup.  Only one meat meal for a week.  That\\'s on Thursday.  You know that in prison, in ancient prison, all the fishes -- nobody, only the head and the tail.  No middle part.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So there is hope for this country, in your view.  Yes?\\n\\nZARNI BO:  Yes, yes.  Especially with the Buddhists believe how to live in situations, dictators, political passion, or even discrimination, everything is happening to us, but the Buddhists say, OK, that\\'s a past life now, even if you do something, you can make something really good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s something pretty cool about meeting people who have been for so long unable to speak.  Now so unguarded about their hopes and their feelings.\\n\\nSizzling meats, the clink of beer glasses, ringing bicycle bells. This is Yangon\\'s 19th Street.  Does Yangon rock?  Can it rock?\\n\\nDARKO, LEAD SINGER, SIDE EFFECT ROCK BAND:  Nine years, really like a must-go place when you are in Yangon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Meet Burmese punk rockers Side Effect, and lead singer Darko.\\n\\nDARKO:  You can come here any time.  There will be lots of people like here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So if you sit here long enough, you\\'ll see every musician in town?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDARKO:  Yes, you can say that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The citywide curfews used to mean close your doors at 11:00 p.m.  Most shops and restaurants still close early but not here on 19th Street, where you can eat barbecue late into the night.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow.  What do we have here?  Grilled tofu?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is pork tail.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pork tail.  Yes.  This is barbecue is awesome.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  These young men show exactly how determined you\\'ve got to be to rock, especially in Burma.\\n\\nDARKO:  I like to say my early influence was Nirvana, and then (INAUDIBLE), and stuff like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What American bands do you hate?\\n\\nDARKO:  Creed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nDARKO:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They are like the worst band in the history of, like, the world.  So what\\'s it like having an indie band in Myanmar? Difficult?\\n\\nDARKO:  For sure, sure.  Yes.  Before you record a song, so you know like when you\\'ve got the lyrics, you have to submit the lyrics, so they\\'re going to censor it, they\\'re going to check it.  And even sometimes they will, you know, suggest to you some words to change.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That must be funny.\\n\\nDARKO:  Very funny, I\\'ll tell you, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now is that still the case?\\n\\nDARKO:  No, it\\'s not like that any more.  They\\'re not going to censor you, but it\\'s going to be kind of risky.  You don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen to you if you write and sing something wrong.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So let me ask this.  If all your dreams came true, where would you want to play?\\n\\nDARKO:  Really?  New York City.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You want to go to New York City?\\n\\nDARKO:  Yes.  My dream is to be strong, so that\\'s why -- what I\\'m -- what I keep telling my band mates.  Come on, be strong.  Have faith.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hope people reach out to you.  Because making roll and roll is hard enough.  A truly independent rock and roll is even harder.  And I\\'m guessing that making it here is harder still.  So, gentlemen, you deserve some success.  People should hear you.\\n\\nDARKO:  Yes.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  So you hear the sleeping car lost a wheel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  The what?\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  The sleeping car lost a wheel.  And the dining car so we get --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, we lost the dining car, I hear.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  We lost the dining car, but even our original sleeping car lost a wheel.  So we just have to hope for the best.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The Night Express to Bagan.  Six hundred kilometers of what will turn out to be kidney-softening travel by rail, but Bagan, Myanmar\\'s ancient capital, I\\'ve been told, is a must- see.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  The true old English experience.  The engine is a French engine from the \\'70s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'ve been told it\\'s a somewhat uncomfortable 10-hour trip.\\n\\n(On camera):  So really the question on this end of the journey is come back on the train or flying coffin?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Mishaps on both Burmese planes and trains are not, shall we say, unheard of.\\n\\n(On camera):  The widow-maker express.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  That is the choice.  That may be the signal to depart at some point.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  All aboard.  Whoa.  We\\'re moving.  Here we go.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Here we go.  That\\'s it.  We are at cruising speed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  This is cruising speed?  We can literally outrun this thing.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  We could.  Jog ahead, have a nice meal in some, you know, recommended restaurant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We could catch up with it.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  With a digestive walk.  Here we go.  This is stop number one of 75.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Heading north, the scenery opens up.  The space between things gets wider, more pastoral, and more beautiful. Looking around at my fellow passengers, it could be hard to distinguish between the 135-plus ethnic groups that make up the Burmese population.  The very name, Burma, refers actually to only one of these groups.\\n\\nWhat they all seem to have in common, however, is a tonika, a face paint in sun block made from tree bark that masks many of their faces.  It\\'s ubiquitous here.  At first jarring to see, it quickly becomes something you get used to and take for granted.\\n\\nYangon\\'s gravitational pull broken, and with darkness falling, the train picks up speed.  At times terrifyingly so.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  If this thing is going to derail at some point.  They have lost how many wheels yesterday?  On this one train?  So truly it\\'s about being in the right car, the one that keeps its wheels.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Derailments or rail splits, as they are referred to here, is somewhat more benign sounding occurrence that say rolling off the tracks into a rice paddy, are not uncommon.  And one can\\'t help wondering what the engineer and conductor are thinking as the train speeds heedlessly on faster and faster.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  I mean, it must be, what, like 40, 50 miles per hour at this point.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I wonder if anyone has ever flown right out of their seat out the window.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  (INAUDIBLE), sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You don\\'t want to be, like, holding a lab dog.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Or a baby or anything.  I mean.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Try pissing in the bathroom and find yourself launched straight up into the ceiling, bringing to a rude conclusion what was already an omni-directional experience.\\n\\n(On camera):  It\\'s smooth now.  It\\'s very relaxing.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  What kind of beer did you have?  I want the same.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  One thousand?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One thousand.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  OK.  Done.  Well, this is breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Nearly 19 hours into our 10-hour trip and the Night Express to Bagan lurches and bounces onward over old and poorly maintained track.\\n\\n(On camera):  And fly back to New York for breakfast.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  I have time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s in yours?\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Carrots.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Potato.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  How do you make good pretty.  Look at this, a bouquet of fish.  Indeed.  This is it.  This is the plain of Bagan.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Out the window, the modern world seems to fade away, then disappear all together, like the last century never happened, or even the century before that.  We\\'re traveling across the largest mainland nation in Southeast Asia.  But it should be pointed out that we are still within the confines of the tourist triangle. Areas permissible for travel.\\n\\nWhole sectors of this country, much of it, in fact, are off- limits.  Simply put, there is shit going on they do not want you to see.  A low intensity conflict with the ethnic Kachin tribe would be one of them.  A wave of persecution and death in the Thu Kine state. The country may be opening up at its center but all along the edges is waging a desperate war to hang on to the status quo.  Needless to say, the status quo is not good.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  All right.  Bagan, here we come.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A thousand years ago Bagan was the capital for a long line of Burma kings.  It\\'s the sort of place where the old coexists with the even older.  As elsewhere in this part of the world, in many of the Buddhist temples here far older animist, spirit-based beliefs coexist with more recent Buddhism.\\n\\nAnd in Myanmar, worship of the gnats is wide spread.  Nat, as I understand it, are more like Greek gods, formed as humans, demigods, spirits, often with very human qualities and failings.\\n\\nDance performances pay homage to the individual nats, performers claiming to actually channel them, bringing about, one hopes, a beneficial spiritual possession.  But I\\'m not just here for a nat pue (ph).  I have a list.  Things to eat in Myanmar.  And this is one of them.  Chicken curry.  And from roadside joints like this nestled among the temple ruins, you\\'re more than likely to catch a very enticing whiff.\\n\\n(On camera):  Just delicious.  Spicy, but not to the point that you want to scream out for mercy, but (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Slow simmered curry served with a side of sour soup made from rozelle leaves.  With it, you get fried ground chillis, pickled bean sprouts, you get the idea.\\n\\n(On camera):  These relishes, these dippy type things, it\\'s like really interesting salad, but I\\'m not that really a salad guy.  The salads here are -- they\\'re happening.  Spicy, sour, salty, savory, just delicious.  Delicious.  A plethora of textures and flavors.\\n\\nThought a lot of their food.  Clearly light thing, like meeting people.  Think a lot about those (INAUDIBLE) thousands of flavors, colors, and textures.  The best restaurant in the country so far, by the way.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nDON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  I\\'m Don Lemon.  Here are your headlines this hour.\\n\\nJohn Kerry again offers open talks to North Korea on their nuclear program, but only if they make the first move.  Kerry\\'s in Tokyo right now.  A North Korean government statement called the offer an American trick.  It\\'s still anyone\\'s guess if the North Koreans are going to launch a missile in the coming hours or days.\\n\\nA former lawman is being held on a $3 million bond in Texas. Eric Williams used to be a Justice of the Peace in Kaufman County. That\\'s where two prosecutors were shot dead in recent weeks.  Deputies went to Williams\\' house with a search warrant, tied to the murders and arrested him.  They are not saying if Williams\\' arrest is directly connected to the case.\\n\\nAustralian Adam Scott won the Masters Golf Tournament today in a sudden death playoff with Argentina\\'s Angel Cabrera.  Scott sank a 12- foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole to capture the first major title.  He\\'s the first Australian ever to win the Masters.  Tiger Woods finished tied for four -- fourth, four strokes back.\\n\\nThose are your headlines this hour.  I\\'m Don Lemon, keeping you informed, CNN, the most trusted name in news.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  You\\'d expect this, an ancient city of nearly unparalleled size and beauty to be overrun with tourists, souvenir shops, snack bars, tours on tape, but, no.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Oh, this is stunning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ll encounter some Western travelers at Bagan\\'s temple sites for sure, but generally speaking they are a hardy bunch. Even the bus tours here are not for the feint of heart or weak of spirit.  But for the most part you\\'re far more likely to bump into a goat than a foreigner.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  This is so beautiful, so much like an ode to human, you know, beliefs and adoration and worshipping and --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Slave labor.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  And slave labor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m thinking you build these many temples, thousands of them in a relatively short period of time, chances are, somebody was working for less than minimum wage, let\\'s put it that way.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  For sure.  We could fly here.  Look at that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  A millennia ago in a period of just under 250 years, over 4,000 structures like this were built here.  They say that a Burma king, Anawrahta, began this project after a conversion to Tera Vata style Buddhism.\\n\\n(On camera):  They started a new temple like every 14 days.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Over 3,000 pagodas, temples and monasteries remain today.  Inside almost every one of them, a Buddha figure, each one different.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  And I like how integrated it is with the trees, pastures.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Actually, funny you should mention that. People used to live here, but the government came along in the \\'80s I believe and relocated.  It was a mass relocation project so any homes, anything, it was understood that this is a good, you know, just a tourist bucks here.  They\\'ve relocated the entire population.\\n\\nWe\\'re in one of the first mass waves of tourists.  European tourists have been coming here in relatively small numbers for a long time, but the floodgates have certainly opened.  They are building hotels like crazy around this area, what\\'s called a tourist triangle.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  What is this here?  This is a nice color.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  As Myanmar begins its shift towards accommodating increasing tourism and a service economy to go with it, there will be adjustments.  There will be, of course, a downside.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How might you pay?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What\\'s that going to mean?  How will Burmese react to all the good and the evils that come with tourism?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK, Mister, what about you?  You buy one? OK.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  Perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s going to mean mobility, it\\'s going to mean prosperity for some.  It will mean a lot of bad things, too.  It will mean prostitution.  It will mean hustling.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Buy one for the children.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  OK.  And you too.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody is selling to you.  You buy plenty.  You buy plenty.  But you don\\'t postcard.  That\\'s not fair. You buy postcard.\\n\\nLAJAUNIE:  But I don\\'t need the postcard.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  We\\'re told the kids are dropping out of school to do this.  The double-edged sword of the service economy.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You want to buy postcard for only $5, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What I\\'m amazed is how friendly and open people are with us, and it\\'s very easy for me to sit here and say whatever I want about the government, right?  Me can go home, you know.  Our lives will go on.  We don\\'t pay the price for that show. Everybody who helped us could very well pay that price.\\n\\nIt should be pointed out that a lot of people did not.  A lot of people were very nice to us but said, look, I just -- I\\'ve already been in jail, you know.  I really don\\'t want to go back.  It\\'s a very real concern what happens to the people we leave behind.  You know, one would think you can\\'t win\\'s one freedom, you know, they have tasted freedom.  Well, you know, you can\\'t put the toothpaste back in the tube, you know.  There\\'s no doubt about that.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  But for the moment at least things seem to be moving in the right direction, a country closed off to most for so long, sleeping, a 50-year nightmare for many of its citizens, finally, may be waking up.  To what?  Time will tell.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST: They don\\'t look friendly.  Who are those -- anyway.  Some ugly Dutch guys it looks like with guns.  I\\'m guessing particularly friendly to the current power.  They look like they\\'re going to or coming from oppressing a black man.  First order of business, man.  When I take my country back, first order of business is to take that -- down.  Am I right or what?  I\\'m kind of amazed.  Tear that (INAUDIBLE) down.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In July 2013, when I went to South Africa, 95-year-old Nelson Mandela was critically ill.  And the country he freed from white minority rule was already in mourning.  And already fearful of what the future might be without him.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s really, really sad because the world still needs him.  He\\'s the guy who fought for our freedom.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I pray that he -- somebody takes the baton from him.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I wish him a speedy recovery.  And come back to his people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So a good friend of mine, a really great travel writer, said something.  The more I travel the less I know.  I feel that particularly strongly here in South Africa, a place I came in a state of near total ignorance, loaded with preconceptions.\\n\\nFor the first part of my life, the South Africa I knew was not a happy place or a good place.  It was a pariah state.  Surrealistically, outrageously divided into black and white.  A throwback to attitudes we thought we\\'d long learned to reject.\\n\\nThe nationalist government in South Africa enacted apartheid laws in 1948.  Who you could marry.  Where you lived.  Where you could walk, be educated.  Everything decided by racist laws backed by police, army and secret services.  The institutionalized racial discrimination was designed to maintain white minority power and economically suppress the black and mixed race South Africans who lived in townships, mostly in poverty.\\n\\nIn 1923, the African National Congress was born.  By 1961, it had been radicalized by the influence of a young Nelson Mandela, among others, and formed an armed wing called the Spear of the Nation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Do you see Africans being able to develop in this country without the Europeans being pushed out?\\n\\nNELSON MANDELA, FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT:  We have made it very clear in our policy that South Africa is a country of many races. There is room for all the various races.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 1963, Mandela was charged with sabotage and conspiracy and sentenced to life imprisonment on Robin Island.  It would take another 27 years of violence and injustice before the inevitable would happen.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you believe in apartheid?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe that according to God\\'s will that the white race should be preserved.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  South Africa\\'s white minority under international sanctions, internal political pressure and the decline of the communist threat, Mandela was we released from prison in 1990.  In \\'94, he was elected president of the new, free South Africa.\\n\\nThere have been very few figures in the entire history of the world as revered or as important as Nelson Mandela.  But the question is, what happens next?\\n\\nJohannesburg or Joe burg or Josie.  The largest city by population in South Africa.  And the economic powerhouse of the country.  Southwest of Johannesburg, Soweto.  Originally an acronym for southwestern townships.  Now the area is considered a suburb.\\n\\nIn 2010, South Africa played host to the World Cup.  The BLK JKS who played for the opening celebration are a Soweto based band.  They are also, not surprisingly, soccer fans.\\n\\nWe\\'re here on game day.  A grudge match in a country where soccer approaches religion.  You can feel it in Soweto or rather you can see it as everywhere you look people show their love for either the local Orlando Pirates or the Johannesburg Kaiser Chiefs.\\n\\nMawilies Inn.  A typical local joint in Soweto.  The perfect place to watch a game, talk about a game, drink yourself silly over the results of a game, or just have a very fine local style meal.  It is, however, a little hard to find.\\n\\nThere are a lot of places like this?  I mean, this used to be the garage or the carport, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Definitely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In what was once a garage are now six tables.  A lawn turned lounge out back.  Closed on Sundays if grandma\\'s visiting. These kinds of bars were born during apartheid times when black South Africans not allowed to own businesses in white areas adapted and improvised.  They did their own thing.  Created these little micro, under the official radar restaurants known around here as eat houses.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Back in the days, obviously, it was illegal.  BOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  During apartheid.  So they will have meetings to actually plan what they\\'re going to do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  So this would be considered a hotbed of sedition and --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now it\\'s just a hot bed of drinking and --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Different kind of sedition.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mpumi and Tshepang from the BLK JKS have just finished watching the game when I join them for some food.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, are these good times in South Africa?  Bad times? Transitional times?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, 1994 was the peak of the good time in South Africa.  Then now with the other politics, you know, other parties fighting, it\\'s quite tense right now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s not like it was before where everybody\\'s -- you know, it\\'s black and white.  Literally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, like, we\\'re unified on this and they\\'re unified on that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These days, the party that freed the country from white rule, the ANC, is not universally loved anymore.  In recent years they\\'ve been criticized for inaction, corruption and cronyism.  And opposition parties are gaining strength.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anything that\\'s maybe new to us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But I think we\\'re trying to navigate new reality. Like how do you deal with so many opinions?  You know, the party that you loved the whole time, that brought about this freedom, is fumbling the ball.  So what do you do?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because in democracy, you should act.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There\\'s the smileys for snack.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Smileys.  Fire roasted sheep\\'s head.  Lips shriveled back in a joker like rectus of deliciousness.  Chopped into tasty, tasty bits and eaten with cold beer?  Yes, of course, yes.  Just needs a little salt and pepper.\\n\\nGood stuff.  That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  This is pap.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s like maize.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pap or meal pap.  A sticky porridge made from ground corn meal.  It fills the role that grits do in the American south.  Rice in much of Asia.  It\\'s tasty, relatively nutritious and cheap filler. And it sops up gravy when you have something like this stewed beef real good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s traditional dumpling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s a dumpling?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Not really like other dumplings.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dumplings.  Important throughout the African Diaspora. Made with flour and yeast.  A spongy, bread type tool for mop-it-up sauce.  Stewed greens, carrots, beans and more gravy.\\n\\nWow.  That\\'s awesome.  So tell me about your band.  How long have you guys been together?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  About 10 years now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa.  A long time.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Would you say you were an indie band?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is there an indie theme -- what I guess I\\'m getting at, is there a -- is there a -- I was kind of getting there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In terms of South African street culture, people are really pushing the boundaries now.  We didn\\'t really have a theme when we started.  You look around.  It\\'s like, man, like demographic is crazy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you mean by that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s not just racial, but classes, you know.  And people are being pushed and then pulled.  It\\'s like an aspirational culture.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think that means?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole rainbow nation notion was quite romantic and ridiculous.  You know, like racism is not on a piece of paper. Just because we voted it out doesn\\'t mean people stop being racist. It\\'s ridiculous in that sense.  But we\\'ve lived something else for 20 years.  People want it.  It\\'s no longer like a coffee table idea.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nSANZA SANDILE, SOUTH AFRICAN CHEF:  Respect money maker.  One love, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Sanza Sandile.  Pioneer of sorts.  He\\'s taken a traditional cook shop space in the Yoville neighborhood of Johannesburg and done something different.  Yoville is a neighborhood where just about everybody comes from somewhere else.\\n\\nSANDILE:  I came here around 10 years ago from Soweto.  Up in Soweto. And when we heard about the bells of change, we all ran to the central part of the city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With the end of apartheid and the emergence of Mandela as not just an inspirational figure but the beginning of real and compassionate black African government, South Africa became a beacon and a refuge for millions of Africans from all over the continent.\\n\\nBlack South Africans fought hard for their freedom and their country. As I understand a lot of them are pretty pissed off about hey, we\\'re just getting our (EXPLETIVE DELETED) together and whoa, all these Congolese and Nigerians, well, you know, they\\'re coming here.\\n\\nSANDILE:  Of course there\\'s going to be that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSANDILE:  Giving and taking, you know.  And then people have been saying, Mandela is going to die, we want to keep all these people away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nSANDILE:  You know, that\\'s not what our people are all about.  And then now that\\'s when I took, you know, the tour of food because that first way to engage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sanza has no formal culinary training.  He\\'s completely self-taught.  Picking up bits and pieces where he can.  Often from the women in the neighborhood.\\n\\nSo you\\'re plucking the best of everybody\\'s culinary culture.\\n\\nSANDILE:  Every day.  Every day I learn.  What are you eating?  Where you from?  I\\'ve been taught by some men.  That\\'s not how it\\'s cooked at home, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  SANDILE:  Go to that auntie.  To the back of some dingy club.  There\\'s a small kitchen.  Look, there, it\\'ll be nice.  Hey, auntie, you know, and then that\\'s me.  Hey, auntie, you know, I\\'m really keen on how you make your particular sauce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'ll show you?\\n\\nSANDILE:  They show me stuff.  I pick up.  Then I rush back to the shop and I try it out.  So I\\'ve got all the elements.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At his cook shop he mixes recipes, ingredients, techniques and traditions as he sees fit.  One reviewer described his style as gastronomic smuggling.  Moving people across borders with dishes that slightly partake of elsewhere.  On today\\'s menu it --\\n\\nSANDILE:  I made this for you.  This is egusi and beef at traditional Nigerian dish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nSANDILE:  They usually use cow leg.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beef stewed with melon and pumpkin seeds.  There\\'s futu. The ubiquitous cornmeal porridge but made to a texture more crumbly than pap.\\n\\nSANDILE:  This is Basamati rice with rose water.  It\\'s aubergines and mangoes.  They\\'re pickled.  And this is with cassava in it from the Congolese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like (INAUDIBLE) with cassava.\\n\\nSANDILE:  Cassava.  This is (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Good taste.  Oh, yes.  Awesome.  Good food here. Menu change every day?\\n\\nSANDILE:  That\\'s our idea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re doing a lot of great food in a small space.\\n\\nThere were no seats.  His customers remain part of the constantly unfolding street theater of Yoville.  They mingle, talk, observe.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lots of people, lots of stories pass through here. Lots of culture interaction.  Because everybody\\'s got something interesting to say as far as we\\'re concerned.\\n\\nSANDILE:  Because food, I knew food is a way to engage.  Got to put something in your mouth to get your ears open, you know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Across town, another pioneer of sorts.  An urban settler in a very different neighborhood.  This is Hillbrow.  A notoriously dangerous district.  And this is Deejay Lez.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ, MUSICIAN:  When I came here, I always dreamed of being a musician.  I see myself singing in front of huge crowds, you know, making money in the process.  That\\'s what I dreamt about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He spins records and promotes acts and events in nightclubs.  We meet in his favorite spot.  Sympathy\\'s Restaurant.\\n\\nWhat\\'s good?  What do you like?  That looks good.  Is that fried chicken?\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  I love -- that\\'s the fried chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The place is heavy with the smell of frying chicken, stewing greens.  Walk right up.  Place your order.  And be sure to get some mill pap.  Heaped on a plate with beats and coleslaw that\\'s a nice, heavy base.\\n\\nSo tell me about the neighborhood.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  When I first came, it was rough, my friend.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Before \\'92, it was like white business district? Residential district?\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  Back then, it used to be clean.  Used to be respected.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Once Hillbrow was an elite whites-only center of town.  But when things started to change, so did Hillbrow.  Becoming one of the first gray areas where whites and blacks mixed.  Hillbrow became aspirational.  A symbol of everything black Africans had long been denied.  But was now accessible.  People poured in in large numbers. Many of them squatters from all over the continent.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  People come here, they come here with one intention. Making a living.  Making money.  Started coming here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  White landlords and tenants simply walked away from their property.  The disenfranchised who moved in legally, semilegally, illegally or just squatting, an influx of gangs and criminal organizations, the area soon slipped into anarchy.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  There\\'s a saying around here.  OK?  That this building\\'s been hijacked.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Entire building were seized to become super stores for illicit drug operations.  Everything that could go wrong, did.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  People make a living from different things.  Some day (INAUDIBLE) people to make a living.  Some they sell their bodies. Sometimes things aren\\'t always according to what you plan.\\n\\nThis is where I live.  This is where my life is.  I\\'ll show you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We walk down the street and one of the many enterprises doing business on corners and in doorways around us becomes alarmed at the sight of our cameras.  Soon there\\'s a mob of very angry people coming our way.  We do not turn around our cameras for obvious reasons.  These days things are slowly, slowly improving.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  But before, we wouldn\\'t walk this freely.  Now we are free.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s actual law enforcement going on in fits and starts. And that\\'s making a difference.  Black owned legitimate businesses have gained a real foothold.  There are new revitalization projects like farmer\\'s markets springing up.  Buildings are being reclaimed. And people here hope that Hillbrow is past the bad old days.\\n\\nDEEJAY LEZ:  There\\'s no fear now.  You have to relax.  To work.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s in a name?  If the name is Soweto, you best believe it means plenty.\\n\\nThis is Madu.  For over a decade he\\'s been in what has at times been the very difficult business of driving a taxi.  You should probably know that the word taxi in Soweto means something a little different than, say, New York.\\n\\nMADU, TAXI DRIVER:  Sixty percent of the population is using taxi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many taxis in Johannesburg?\\n\\nMADU:  I would say more than a million.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This coming from a potential passenger means Soweto.  Also this and this.  Johannesburg has an elaborate system of hand signals indicating desired routes of travel.\\n\\nSo you\\'re looking at the hand signals and said, OK, I\\'m not going there, I\\'m not going there.\\n\\nMADU:  I\\'m looking at the hand signals.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 1994 Soweto came into being as a less benign version of the housing project.  It was designed as workers lodging.  A place to put black laborers comfortably removed from white society.  A ghetto. By the 1950s it had become the center of resistance to white rule. Synonymous with the struggle against the whole rotten racist system.\\n\\nMADU:  I remember one day the situation was so bad in such a way that my mother had to put me inside a box where we put shoes and hide me there, under the bed.\\n\\nThis is where I grew up, most of the time.  And sometimes you would get bullied.  There was this time two guys were following me.  They lifted me up and I had probably some few coing in my pocket and just turned me around.  Just to shake me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Shake you upside down?\\n\\nMADU:  Shake me upside down.  I will never forget that moment in my life.  I felt stupid, you know?\\n\\nGet on, get on, Ma.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How are you?\\n\\nMADU:  Hello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now there is a definite cache to living in Soweto.  A very real pride back at having been at the very center of things back when it was hard and dangerous to have an opinion.  Nelson Mandela lived here.  Desmond Tutu.  When you\\'re a certain age and you say you were born and bred in Soweto, it means something.\\n\\nDo mostly people own their homes or do they rent?\\n\\nMADU:  Mostly people own their homes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They start to make a little more money, things starts get a little better.  Can you build up?\\n\\nMADU:  Yes.  You can build up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look at the streets here and you see what that kind of pride does.  It may not be a rich area, but it\\'s immaculate.  Squared away.  An emerging middle class coming up, rather than fleeing to elsewhere.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hey, have a nice day.  Thank you.\\n\\nMADU:  Those ladies over here, you can see they\\'re marketing for their stalls.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know where you\\'re going, right?\\n\\nMADU:  Yes.  I know where I\\'m going.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Next exit?  Smoky delicious meat over flame.  Under the overpass, all sorts of mystery meats for sale.  The taxi man\\'s lunch. We order some brisket, some sausage, some heart.  Beautiful thing. Meat, a cutting board, a knife.\\n\\nMADU:  Cut out the meat in pieces.  That\\'s how you eat it.  Most of the time they serve it with tomato and raw chile.  That\\'s more or less a salad for you.  You have salt over here.  It\\'s nice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You chose well.  These guys are good.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Here, spread over thousands of square feet, the remnants of white colonial rule, what\\'s left from the descendants of Bible-thumping Dutch settlers who came here to farm, to ranch, to build their own world on top of an existing one.\\n\\nThe Boers, as they were known, came in the 1600s.  If nothing else can be said about them, they were a tough bunch of bastards.  In the 1800s, the British came.  Diamonds were discovered.  Greed heads jockeyed for power.  There was war, and an ugly one.\\n\\nIn the end, there was an uneasy shares of power.  The Boers been known as Afrikaners.  In the 20th century, racist Afrikaners ideology grew. Apartheid laws were enacted, and white domination became the rule for almost 100 years.\\n\\nBut look, meat.  You want to see an expat South African weep, wave some of this under their nose.\\n\\n(on camera):  It\\'s like a Mussolini themed restaurant?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  That\\'s it.  That\\'s it.  Neo-fascist butchery.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In the good old days.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It doesn\\'t look like any butcher I\\'ve been into.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  An hour north by northwest to Johannesburg is Pretoria.  Still the administrative center of South Africa, once the heart of apartheid.  Here you can find a father/son butchery, restaurant and themed museum.  I just don\\'t know how I feel about this place.  It doesn\\'t fit in with my white liberal guilt sensibility.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With all of this kind of Africana paraphernalia and it just wouldn\\'t be accepted.  Couldn\\'t exist.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As any South African butcher would, they sell (INAUDIBLE). They sprinkle salt, brown sugar, more vinegar.  Pack in layers, repeat.\\n\\nAfter 24 hours, remove and hang to air dry for a week.  Voila.  A tasty jerky treat we can all get behind.\\n\\nChef Andrea Burgener (ph) South African by birth, English and German by background, can usually be found in the trenches of her Joburg restaurant, the Leopard.  She\\'s known for her playful menus but loathes culinary fashion.  She strives for a locally grounded cuisine.\\n\\nToday, however, she\\'s my guide through this twilight zone.\\n\\nIt\\'s weird here.  And though I\\'m told the place usually reflects the changing demographic of modern South Africa, today, not so much.  The customers may or may not have feelings about the Afrikaner memorabilia.  Really they just come for meat.\\n\\nPick your meat at the butcher counter, choose T-bone, some rum steak. Spicy sausage made from beef and pork.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Our secret ingredient is monkey gland sauce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Monkey gland sauce.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Every steak house has monkey gland sauce.  It\\'s barbecue sauce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They cook it up along with some pap and fries and presto, a colon clogging pile of meat in the ruins of empire.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  I mean, meat is a very big thing.  There\\'s enough of it, I think. BOURDAIN:  Good Lord.  I can swim in it.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Tastes like oppression.\\n\\n(on camera):  After this show airs, I\\'m going to get a huge amount of mail saying why didn\\'t you go to Cape Town, great modern restaurants, cutting edge chefs.  Is it all right I missed all that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I feel like those particular restaurants in Cape Town are not really representative of what most people in this country are eating.  I think a lot of our most basic stuff is really what we do best.  This food is absolutely got no interest in fashion.  It\\'s never going to change.  There\\'ll still be the monkey gland sauce and (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think the white chefs here understand the greatest advantage they have is that this enormous pan African larder of ingredients and flavors?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  If you\\'re a whitey in the city, you\\'re probably going to eat the worst food of anyone in the city, quite honestly.  In every country, obviously food is political.  It always feels like it\\'s a bit more political here, that there are these layers of things that you couldn\\'t have.\\n\\nLike restaurants, I mean, I go to restaurants.  I think to myself, wow, this many years ago, I couldn\\'t have come here with this person. They were not allowed to sit in here.  And I remember very clearly being around 8.\\n\\nThe cafe owner would regularly not pay the customer who was black with change.  He would pay him with bubble gum.  And the guy somehow, he couldn\\'t argue.  If you were a black guy, you got your change in bubble gum.  I was 8 years old feeling like, oh, my God, it was so terrible.  But you couldn\\'t say anything, because that would have been worse.\\n\\nSo, it was a weird thing of (INAUDIBLE), so un-innocent and represented such badness.  It just seems mad.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is an eland, the largest antelope in the world.  It is also, unluckily for him, delicious.\\n\\n(GUNSHOT)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Got him.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that was very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It\\'s a little sad. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know what?  That is such good meat.  That\\'s really what we do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Though this one weighs in around a ton, rest assured, every bite, every scrap, will be eaten.  Some of that, tonight at dinner.\\n\\nChef Andrea Burgener, Dionne (ph), a local hunting expert, and myself join Prospero Bailey on his game farm.  Prospero\\'s dad Jim Bailey was the legendary publisher of the sly subversive \"Drum\" magazine, the first of its kind during apartheid.  A black oriented investigative magazine slickly disguised as glossy pop culture.\\n\\nProspera\\'s farm is mere 20 miles from Johannesburg.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see the city there?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.  To have all this in sight of the city.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Near Prospero\\'s farm and hidden within the city\\'s shadow is what\\'s known as the Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO world heritage site.  An incredible look back at where we, the human animal, came from.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s a classic little sink hole.  There are loads of these.  This is what this area is.  I mean, the Cradle.  It\\'s called a Cradle.  Now, a world heritage site, because 60 percent of all the evidence for human evolution comes out of the valley.  It\\'s from caves like this that keep the record.  That geology just conspires to preserve fossils.\\n\\nThey\\'re very, very rare things, humanoid fossils.  But they\\'re found more here in the last ten years than they\\'re found anywhere.  So you\\'re home.  This is where you started.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is my ancestral homeland?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is your ancestral homeland.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That sound makes me happy.  What does that sound remind you of, guys?  What does that evoke for you, that sound?  Primeval, you know, happy childhood to the beach, meet sibling over the fire, parental love, your enemy\\'s genitals frying in hot oil?  Nothing?  No?\\n\\n(voice-over):  Downright, fire and fresh killed eland, I get to work on the heart.  Something I strongly suspect will be delicious.  And I\\'m right.\\n\\nAndrea works her magic on the liver.  Dredged in flour and sauteed. This loin seared and glazed with booze.  There\\'s eland paprika (ph). A riff on the Hungarian stew with paprika, peppers, onion, tomatoes and cream.\\n\\nAs the sunsets over the belt, Johannesburg lights blinking in the distance, a feast.\\n\\n(on camera):  Meat on the plate.  Blood on my pants.  Life is good.\\n\\nI\\'ve been very, very, very confused by my visit here.  You\\'ve got basically a goulash here.  it tell you it inflicted liver on here (ph).  The bread someone referred to as Portuguese?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Portuguese but it\\'s from Madera.  That bread, flat bread.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  South Africa depending on who I talk to is a completely different construct.  So some people someone who comes from South African, from anywhere else in Africa and brings good stuff with them. Other stuff from Malaysia, East Indies, Dutch, there\\'s the English influence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There were so many different colonialists.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One at this table is originally African and does that have a meaning?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This wood is pine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I arrived in this country spectacularly ignorant.  I will leave spectacularly ignorant.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Ramadan.  At this hour, all over Johannesburg, members of South Africa\\'s sizable Muslim community observe.  The religion of Islam as well as many of south Africa\\'s most beloved and most delicious dishes and ingredients like sambal (ph), chutney (ph) and bunny chow (ph) come from Malaysia, Indonesia, India.\\n\\nDuring apartheid, many South Africans would have been referred to as colored.  Colored didn\\'t mean black.  It meant everybody else who wasn\\'t exactly white, Asians and mixed race.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s garlic, ginger and chilies.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In the observatory neighborhood of Johannesburg, the Rasdian (ph) family prepares for the meal at sundown when fasting for Ramadan is broken.\\n\\nJoey Rasdian is a standup comedian, an actor of cape Malay background. This dish, panang curry with beef and eggs.  Joey\\'s wife, Cindy, prepares a chicken pie.  Son, Hakeem, makes the traditional Ramadan shake.\\n\\nDaughter, Laya (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can cook. BOURDAIN:  (on camera):  Everything smells terrific.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s nicer to have soup after you\\'ve not eaten the whole day.  It\\'s light and nourishing and filling and all of those good things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s also cheese and beef samosas.\\n\\n(on camera):  These are delicious.  You were born here.  Born in Johannesburg?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was.  (INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how are things?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It depends on what you are speaking about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Society operates the way society should.  But on the other hand, many ways this is a new country.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is.  It\\'s 19 years old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everybody is from someplace else.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   I think the Africans from the other countries see south Africa as a place of hope.  Because if there\\'s a lot here, then there are a lot of opportunities, lots of people might get from here.  A long time, 3 million Germans come in here, 3 million French people coming here.  Africans would corm from far place to come and find a little bit of something here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIIFED MALE:  So, how do you find South Africa so far?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like it.  I\\'m very comfortable here.  I like a country where people have a sense of humor.  There\\'s a lot of ball busting doing on here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All the time, from the top to the bottom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Twenty years from you, what\\'s South Africa going to be like?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Their generation, the born frees now is the ones that\\'s giving our current president lots of hell.  The born frees is the one that was born in the new democracy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Or just before the first election.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The born frees are like, look here, we went to school.  This is right and this is wrong.  What you\\'re doing is wrong.\\n\\nBut we\\'re at a struggle.  Yes, we weren\\'t part of the struggle.  I don\\'t care.  Thank you for the struggle.  I\\'ve got Twitter now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I want five bars on my 3G, I want Wi-Fi, and it better be high speed.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why can\\'t I have them?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why can\\'t I have them?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don\\'t think the current politicians foresaw that.  Foresaw the born frees not supporting them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s a critical mass of young people that wants to change South Africa in a positive way.  How they do it or how they go about it, I don\\'t know the answer to that.  Neither do they know the answer to that.  But their intention is clear.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  No more hipster jokes.  It\\'s low hanging fruit.  And one can no longer argue against the steady creek of their foodie sensibilities.  Artisanal cheeses, yes, right over there.  Hand made charcuterie?  Yes, there.  Thin crust pizza, a very respectable piayya, yes, yes, and yes.\\n\\nIt\\'s official.  They\\'re here and they aren\\'t going anywhere.\\n\\n(on camera):  I like the idea of a burger for breakfast or is there something perverse about that.\\n\\n(voice-over):  Throw in a crowd of much more racially diverse and hungry people, and you might think you\\'re in Brooklyn.\\n\\nSurely, this is not a bad thing.  This is neighbor goods market in Bram Fontaine (ph) precinct of Johannesburg.\\n\\nMy dining companion, city press arts and features writer Percy Mumbando (ph) says we should hold out for this, the Balkan burger.\\n\\n(on camera):  One with cheese for me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lots of cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  (INAUDIBLE) flattened ground beef seared over flames.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cook the food right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Add cascabel and mozzarella cheese, fold it up, pick your condiments, you\\'ve got cabbage, tomato, onion, lettuce, hot peppers.\\n\\nUp to the roof with a view and eat.\\n\\n(on camera):  Spicy.  Good.\\n\\nI guess I want to talk about Nelson Mandela.  Because what I was not aware of at all was the degree to which he was personally responsible for really the nuts and bolts of the transition from white rule to majority rule.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, he\\'s very ill.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happens after Mandela, do you think?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We go on.  I think the foundation is laid, and I think through God we have him as a symbol.  I think Mandela represents our collective better intention as a nation.  The test we use to check the way forth.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All the things that could have gone terribly wrong, it\\'s a remarkable thing how well it went.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Between 1990 and 1994, tough times, you know, into the city fighting, black-on-black violence, black-on-white violence. Are we going to descend into a blood bath?\\n\\nBut we transcended that through the message of coming together regardless of the unresolved issues.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To what extent is it really an issue?  Are things getting mixed?  We like to think we live in a rainbow nation, but in fact, in the states like to a great extent in different neighborhoods.  Only in 19 years, in some ways it looks to me outside looking in, a little more gracefully mixed up than we\\'ve managed in the States.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here you\\'ve got black, white, colored, all sorts of people here.  But I think, I also say this also, once you have the knowledge that the economic disparities are managing to keep us divided as well.\\n\\nI think what we need to do is unpack what we mean by rainbow.  I think of being united in our diversity also means that there\\'ll be moments of discord.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think things will continue to improve?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  I think we\\'ve seen our worst.  And that\\'s not to say that we\\'re getting it right all the time.  But it\\'s an experiment of democracy, an experiment you need to find as you go along.\\n\\nThat\\'s really the South African story.  The dream is there.  We all agree that the visions are there.  But these are not bigger than our hopes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What did I know about South Africa before I game here?  Exactly nothing, as it turns out.  But I think based on what I\\'ve seen, that if the world can get it right here, a country with a past like South Africa\\'s, if they can figure out how to make it work here for everybody.  Absorb all the people flooding in from all over Africa, continue to make Mandela\\'s dream a reality, maybe there\\'s hope for the rest of us.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  For Korean-Americans -- according to the stereotype, anyway -- it used to be that you grew up to be a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer.  There were a specific set of rules and expectations.\\n\\nDAVID CHOE, ARTIST:  Are you asking me to be in a porno?  Is that what you\\'re asking me?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thanks to some remarkably bad Koreans, though, things are beginning to change.\\n\\nROY CHOI, CHEF:  I went to one year of law school and I walked out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, you\\'re a bad Korean?\\n\\nCHOI:  Now, I\\'m bad Korean.\\n\\nCHOE:  Any final advice to someone who\\'s actually about to marry a Korean woman?  The answer -- don\\'t do it.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nCHOI:  All I knew was that this town was going down, and no one was showing up.  So we as Koreans figured that out really quickly. There\\'s a point where we look at each other and say --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re not coming.\\n\\nCHOI:  They\\'re not coming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The choppers will not be here anytime soon.\\n\\nCHOI:  That\\'s when all the stuff started to do go down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Roy Choi is a second-generation Korean- American.  He lives in Los Angeles.  He\\'s the owner/operator of four groundbreaking and much-loved food trucks, among the first to harness the strange and terrible powers of social media to alert customers to where to find delicious food.\\n\\nCHOI:  This was the command post.  From here, you know you could look and you could see if fires were going on. BOURDAIN:  When the Los Angeles riots happened in 1992, Roy was 22 years old.  In this plaza\\'s rooftop played a central role for Koreans defending their town.\\n\\nLet\\'s back up a bit.  After the Immigration Act of 1965, thousands of Koreans began arriving in L.A.  The first to arrive were mostly middle-class, college-educated, hoping to make a lateral move into American society.  But unless you have a medical or engineering degree, that turned out to be tough.\\n\\nThey found work as merchants, store owners, opened liquor stores, groceries, massage studios, dry cleaners.  They did that in an area that was, as it\\'s called, underserved, where major chains feared to tread, where others preferred to abandon, Koreans moved in.\\n\\nSo, 1992 -- four L.A. police officers are on trial for what sure as hell looked to me like a wildly excessive and prolonged beating of an unarmed Rodney King.  In April of that year, they were acquitted.  For me, it was a \"holy shit, I never saw that coming\" moment.  For African-Americans, it was a ruder (ph) surprise.  To say people were angry would be an understatement.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They don\\'t represent the people no more.\\n\\nCHOI:  So you could almost feel it like a tidal wave coming.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The LAPD were completely unprepared for what happened next.\\n\\nCHOI:  Everything you see here, all this was being looted.  Chairs and rocks, and everything being thrown through walls.  If you go straight down western on Venice, the whole plaza burned on fire.  We were calling 911, and there was no response.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Did the cops come at all?\\n\\nCHOI:  I was here all three days.  I didn\\'t see any cops.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Where did they set up their front line?\\n\\nCHOI:  Rodeo Drive.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Where did the forces of law and order set up their perimeter?  Not they\\'re.  Koreatown was left to its own devices. The official borders are Third Street on the north end, Olympic Boulevard to the south, Vermont Avenue in the east, and Western Avenue to the west.  That\\'s three square miles.  That\\'s pretty much to burn or fend for itself.\\n\\nThis rooftop quickly became the command post for rapidly improvised Korean defense forces.  They armed themselves, set up crude but effective command and control, communication and patrols.\\n\\nCHOI:  We weren\\'t going around just slugging and capping people.  All that was happening was just don\\'t break down my store.  Making sure our parents, our uncles, our families, these stores, this town, stays alive. BOURDAIN:  Fifty-eight people were killed.  Only a quarter of Korean- owned businesses survived, either destroyed outright during the riots or abandoned afterwards by owners who felt the entire underpinning of their contract with America had shifted.  Yet today, Korean town is bigger and better and forever changed by what happened in 1992.\\n\\nDong Il Jang (ph), however is as an unwaveringly old school.  Roy and I sit down with Roy Kim, whose grandfather opened the place in 1978. Like most Korean restaurants at the time, you didn\\'t mess with the original, ever.  And like most father/son relationships, you obeyed dad\\'s wishes, no matter what.\\n\\nROY KIM:  My father opened put all this redwood and cherry, to this day I can\\'t touch certain things here.\\n\\nCHOI:  He doesn\\'t let you change the uniforms, either.\\n\\nKIM:  No.  He still controls the restaurant.\\n\\nCHOI:  You just don\\'t the work.\\n\\nKIM:  I just do the work.  As a Korean, we know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We start with the bon chon (ph), all those delicious little freebie plates of pickles, preserves, kimchi, a spicy squid or two. No bon chon, no meal.\\n\\nCHOI:  And you know what this restaurant has that a lot of restaurants are going away from is the chairless rooms.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  The feet under, knees forward?  No can do.\\n\\nCHOI:  That was punishment for Koreans.  That\\'s a punishment.\\n\\nKIM:  And with a book over your head.\\n\\nCHOI:  For hours.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What would a crime -- what got you into that position?\\n\\nCHOI:  I mean, it could be as minimal as a 94 on a test.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Korean parents?  Well, let\\'s just say they veer towards -- moms and dads were not, shall we say, conflicted about corporal punishment.  I love that you both immediately recognize it.\\n\\nKIM:  This is roast gui.  This is what we\\'re known it, thinly sliced ribeye marbled.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  It\\'s beautiful.\\n\\n(voice-over): Roast gui, thin sliced ribeye.  And Bulgogi, thinly sliced fat marbled beef, barbecued tableside.\\n\\nCHOI:  For us Koreans, it\\'s kind of funny that barbecue has become the gateway to our food. BOURDAIN (on camera):  Hey, it could be worse.  I mean, at least it\\'s delicious.\\n\\nCHOI:  It\\'s delicious and we\\'re like, okay, this is the portal, and we\\'re cool with that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And this kimchi Bulgogi, Bokumbap, basically kimchi fried rice, but it fries into the pan like paella, so many great rice dishes with that outer layer of crispy stuff is just the best.\\n\\nKIM:  A tableside cooking, I think people overlook that a lot.  This is like crepes suzette, filleting a dover sole.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Oh, man, this is ridiculously delicious.  Will you be doing this in 20 years?\\n\\nKIM:  If we did change, tonight I would get a complaint.\\n\\nCHOI:  And you\\'d have to talk to your dad.\\n\\nKIM:  Oh, yes.  That\\'s the problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What do you do if you\\'re a locavore in L.A.? You look around.  What\\'s local and delicious?  (INAUDIBLE) and authentic and is iconically L.A. as it gets.\\n\\nIf you\\'re Roy Choi, you see tacos.  With the Kogi truck, Roy Choi brought one of the first break mutation mash-ups of Korean and Mexican to the people.\\n\\nWhat started as one truck became four trucks, and three brick-and- mortar restaurants to go with them.\\n\\nCHOI: For me Kogi was only one trucks in the line.  But the lines got big, you know?\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Roy trained at the Culinary Institute of America, and interned at La Veranda in New York City.  He wants his trucks like you\\'d expect of someone with that background.\\n\\nCHOI:  Within our food media landscape, we\\'ve romanticized certain compositions of what a great chef and great kitchen are supposed to look, smell and feel like.  But just because those are beautiful doesn\\'t mean this is not beautiful.\\n\\nFor me, I don\\'t see mustard plants and sheep grazing.  I see barbed wire and telephone poles.  I see puddles, and, you know, all of that stuff contribute to the flavor of the foot.  So it\\'s truly what I call a terroir, a regional food.\\n\\nAnd they\\'re off.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every lunch shift and every evening, the trucks\\' locations are sent out over Twitter.  The locations change every day.  And people flock quickly to find them, as the lines can get long, very long.\\n\\nI took a run with Roy as he made his nightly rounds.\\n\\n(on camera):  So how often do you make the full circuit between all of your various enterprises?\\n\\nCHOI:  Twice a day, every day, unless I\\'m doing something crazy like this.  It\\'s kind of like I have a huge Las Vegas hotel, but the hallways are the streets.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  First stop, Chego!  A rice bowl place in the Palms neighborhood.\\n\\nCHOI:  These are my guys right here.  Hola.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kimchi, spam, classic.\\n\\nCHOI:  That is the menu here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A big bowl of rice with meat, vegetables and lots of flavor, for less than 10 bucks.  Good deal.\\n\\n(on camera):  I just want to know, you\\'re so sentimental about the business of feeding people.\\n\\nCHOI:  It\\'s a trippy state sense of romanticism like I\\'m very hard- assed too.  Like you pack your own shit, you get what you get.  If you complain, I take the food out of your hands and give you your money back.\\n\\nBut within those rules, there\\'s a lot of love.  There\\'s a lot of care.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Across town in Venice is A-Frame, Roy\\'s first brick and mortar.\\n\\nCHOI:  This used to be a IHOP.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes.\\n\\nCHOI:  So everything is really new.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hence the shape.\\n\\n(voice-over):  It\\'s heavily influenced by local takes on Hawaiian cooking, not that you would necessarily notice.  Every dish designed to be eaten with the hand.\\n\\nWhat\\'s good?  The baby back ribs are air dried, braised, then breaded and fried.  Lingcod tacos treated like shawarma.  Beer can crackling chicken is braid (INAUDIBLE) with air dried like Peking duck then fried. Meanwhile, not too far away, a Kogi truck pulls up, stops, reverses back to the corner.  Before the awning is up, there\\'s already a line. Hungry people have been waiting in cars around the corner ever since the Twitter announcement 30 minutes ago.\\n\\n(on camera):  I feel guilty, I\\'m jumping the line.  Wow, what\\'s the longest line you ever had?\\n\\nCHOI:  Six hundred.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Six hundred people for one truck?\\n\\nCHOI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The Kogi taco, double caramelized Korean barbeque short rib on fresh corn tortilla, with salsa roja, cilantro onion-lime relish, and napa cabbage Romain slaw, and a chili soy vinaigrette.\\n\\n(on camera):  Oh, yes.\\n\\nCHOI:  The rap for Kogi is we go everywhere.  We go to every single corner of the county and the city.  We\\'re not just going to the hip areas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about fantastic - what about Bel Air?  Can you pull up on a corner in a residential area in Bel Air?  What happens there?  Do you get rousted?\\n\\nCHOI:  No, no, they come out in a Versace robe and --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That I got to see.\\n\\nCHOI:  Beverly Hills has lots spaces.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why should you be excited about food trucks, because they allow creative chefs Roy without a lot of money to start creating and selling their stuff, introducing themselves to the world without having to gather up a million dollars or credulous partners, and they\\'re affordable, they\\'re democratic, and they are faster, better and infinitely preferable to fast food like the king and the clown and the colonel.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over): Stereotyping coming.  Look, how do I put this? Good Korean kids grow up to be doctors, lawyers or engineers, goes the story.  There are expectations.\\n\\nBut what if you\\'re a bad Korean?  What if you\\'re Korean-American and just didn\\'t give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED)?  What if you look around, ask yourself, who am I?  Who I suppose to be?  Where do I fit in society? And were unsatisfied with the answers you were getting?\\n\\nWhat if you were an insanely talented artist in a small startup company called Facebook asks you to do some murals in their offices, and they paid you with stock, and you became ridiculously wealthy, and you still didn\\'t give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED)?  Well, then you might be David Choe.\\n\\nDAVID CHOE, ARTIST:  Hi.  I\\'m David Choe.\\n\\nYou\\'re like me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Is that an AK pinata?\\n\\nCHOE:  That is an AK-47 pinata.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nCHOE:  I mean, this place is in downtown L.A., so I should have as many weapons like hidden throughout.  I got ninja swords and ninja stars.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You need a puppy, man.  You need a puppy.\\n\\nCHOE:  I do need a puppy.\\n\\nI\\'m going to paint you today.  Is that cool?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, sure.\\n\\nCHOE:  All right.  So just sit right there, and -- sorry, I don\\'t usually paint this early in the morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nCHOE:  I\\'m going to go more expressionistic, if you don\\'t mind.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I want to know, you said young people are looking to follow your road to success, your advice is, whatever you do, don\\'t date a Korean girl?\\n\\nCHOE:  OK, I try to be open-minded things, right?  But, oh, I\\'m racist.  For me, I\\'ve given it a shot and I end up with a situation where I feel like I\\'m dating my mom.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What characteristics in common were you --\\n\\nCHOE:  Overbearing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Overbearing.\\n\\nCHOE:  Jjealous, unreasonable, like unrealistic about life, demanding. Like, I mean, I could go on on and on.  If you\\'re a woman, I would never recommend dating a Korean guy.\\n\\nFor the very few women out there into Asian guys, if you are going to go that route, definitely go Chinese. Yes.  Come check it out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, yes.   Whoa!  Awesome.\\n\\nWow.\\n\\nCHOE:  I don\\'t know.  What do you think?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Dude, I\\'m honored.  I\\'ve never had my portrayed done before.\\n\\nCHOE:  Hey, man.  You\\'re welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And this shit (ph) is going to be worth some money on eBay, for sure.\\n\\nCHOE:  Now I\\'m definitely ready for Sizzler.  Nice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Standing tall and prominent amongst the many Asian and Central American restaurants in the community, one place holds a cherished position in the collective memories of many second- generation Korean-Americans.\\n\\nI am personally unfamiliar with the Sizzler brand.  I know it by name, but never have I managed to actually cross its doors.\\n\\nCHOE:  After you. Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Wow.\\n\\nHow are you doing today?\\n\\nCHOE:  I\\'m doing fantastic.  I have my Sizzler outfit on.\\n\\nSo, here\\'s the thing.  You can get a steak and add the salad bar with it, the best bang for your buck or you could just get the salad bar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have to have some steak.\\n\\nCHOE:  I am going to go traditional and just get just the salad bar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You can sit wherever you like.\\n\\nCHOE:  Excellent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, yes.\\n\\n(INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, now, you\\'re getting Korean on me.\\n\\nCHOE:  Super-embarrassed, because we\\'re in Koreatown, and I\\'m taking you to Sizzler, which for a lot of Koreans, it\\'s the best food in Koreatown.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you eat non-Korean, this was it.\\n\\nCHOE:  We never ate out ever, if we did, it was McDonald\\'s.  If it was a birthday or special celebration and wanted to kick it up a notch and go a little bit more special, then it was Sizzler.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  This is a judgment-free zone, where there are no mistakes.  A world to explore in congruous combinations without shame or guilt, free of criticism from snarkologist, because there are no snarkologists at Sizzler.\\n\\nCHOE:  Obviously, here\\'s the accoutrements for making a nice nacho, taco salad, and pasta, spaghetti.  Get a taco shell and put meatballs in it.  This is Italian/Mexican dining, and you make a meat ball taco, and there\\'s nowhere else in the world where you can have this.  We put three meatballs in the taco, some guacamole, and then you put all this nacho cheese, all these other stuff.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  I know what I\\'m going.  I\\'m going for the full south of the border experience here.\\n\\nCHOE:  All right.  There you go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not kidding around here.  Oh, yes, now we\\'re talking, my friend.\\n\\nCHOE:  It\\'s a little bit nicer than I remember.\\n\\nThere it is.  That\\'s the best bread that you can get.  You tell me if you like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying that the cheese bread is complimentary?\\n\\nCHOE:  It\\'s a complimentary.  And once we found that out, we would order stacks of it.  It was our favorite part of Sizzler.  And we\\'re like we need to figure out how to manufacture it at home.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So were you good Sizzler customers?  Do you think they were happy to see you come?\\n\\nI love this dish, man.  When I go back, I might have to have a meatball taco.\\n\\nCHOE:  We goosed the system a bit, but not completely abused it. There would be the guilt associated with we never eat out, but now we are going out to eat.  So you better (EXPLETIVE DELETED) if you\\'ve got to put down at least three plates.\\n\\nSo, what do you think of the bread?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s delicious.\\n\\nCHOE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I get why it could be a wonderland.\\n\\nCHOE:  It\\'s really good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For you, Sizzler a happy place?\\n\\nCHOE:  Still, lots of memories.  It\\'s satisfying.\\n\\nGet me more of this cheese bread.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Something Dave Choe and Roy Choi have in common is they maybe Korean Americans, but they are also very much creatures of L.A.  And what is LA.?  L.A. is Mexican, Central American, Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai, Samoan, Bangladeshi.\\n\\nEverybody has left their mark, continues to shape the town, determine its character.  K-town exists right upside its Latino neighbors, and I guess it\\'s natural that both Choe and Choi identify very much with Mexican street culture.\\n\\nFew things embodied a particularly southern California Latino street culture more than low-riding.\\n\\nEsteban Oriel (ph) is a photographer, chronicler of everything iconic at the crossroads of hip-hop, design, tattooing, fashion, and low- riding.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They used to put sandbags in their trunks to make them lower and around the \\'70s, they got popular.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Why these particular models?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pretty much always been the late \\'50 this is through the \\'60s, and any \\'80s, they starting bringing in the Cadillacs and Regales.\\n\\nThe most classic well-known car for low-riding is probably the \\'64 Impala.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How many Korean low riders are there?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALEL:  There\\'s a few Asian ones, sprinkled in to other clubs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  More Asians?  More Koreans than 15 years ago?\\n\\nWe\\'re seeing a crossover with the food.\\n\\nCHOE:  Right.  For the most part things are starting to get more open. If you\\'re asking, I think there\\'s going to be a lot more Asian- Hispanic mixed babies coming up in the future. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amen to that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Ideal low-riding is about getting appreciated by the people who best appreciate the traditions and techniques, the getting it right.  For that, you head to East L.A.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The most famous notorious street in LA. is Wilshire Boulevard, because of the history of it, and the Crenshaw Boulevard in south central.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  So, that\\'s going to be your most critical audience and most appreciative.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, the ones you want to see your car, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):   It\\'s a slow-moving piece of art.  You treat the car a piece of art, acutely aware of the dangers -- cops, for whom you are a target, potholes, other cars.  In East L.A., you see people ooh and ah, you see people change the expression from what is that, to nice ride.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hopefully gang members like cops, giving us respect, you know?\\n\\nFirst, you build a car for yourself.  At the same time, you\\'re building it for the streets, for the people.  You want them to appreciate it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Within the border of Koreatown, it\\'s not just Koreans. There are new arrive arrivals every day.  There\\'s, in fact, an official little Bangladesh right in the middle of K-Town.\\n\\n(on camera):  You\\'re not short of options around here.\\n\\nCHOI:  No, you can get tacos across the street.  Korean (INAUDIBLE) next door and goat stew.  You can pray to Muhammad or Buddha.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The tiny mosque next door where services are held five times a day.\\n\\n(on camera):  I was talking to a gentleman who said this is the first little Bangladesh in America.\\n\\nCHOI:  And it just happened like two years ago.  It was like we went to sleep and woke up and there was little Bangladesh.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here at (INAUDIBLE), step right in for curried goats, samosas, Tandoori chicken.  Oh, yes, and this -- fish curry with no small amount of chilies.\\n\\n(on camera):  Just such aromatic, delicious food.  What other food.\\n\\nOne good food you\\'re likely to find within the confines of Koreatown?\\n\\nCHOI:  We have El Salvadorian, Guatemalans all around.  Koreans all throughout, Pakistani, Bangladesh food.  Oaxaca takes over all of Eighth Street.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why Oaxaca?  Is that just the way it worked out?\\n\\nCHOI:  Yes.  Yu know how it goes.  One guy showed up.\\n\\nFilipino fast food just behind us, and a bunch of riffraffs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Filipinos are very proud of their food, underrepresented.\\n\\nCHOI:  They\\'re going through what we went through, where the glass hasn\\'t been broken yet, to translate it, but stil keep the core and soul of it, but it tastes delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  A few blocks over, the iconic Filipino fast- foot chain Jollibee.  Laugh all you one, but ask any Filipino, they love the drive-thru mutation for specialties like this fried spam sandwich thing.  But it\\'s the desserts where it gets really crazy.\\n\\n(on camera):  Decisions, decisions.\\n\\nCHOI:  Yes, here we go.\\n\\nWe\\'ll take one aloha burger, and then one spam little big bite.  Let\\'s do a halo-halo.  That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, look at that.  What is that?\\n\\nCHOI:  That\\'s halo-halo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Oh, yes, halo-halo.  Dig deep and you hit delicious stratas of red beans, white beans and chickpeas, cubes of red and green jell-o, young white coconut, shaved eye, coconut, and is that flan?  It makes no goddamned sense at all.  I love it.\\n\\nCHOI:  A part of every Pinoy, Filipino\\'s life, halo-halo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ve got to take a picture of that.  It\\'s oddly beautiful.\\n\\nYou know I\\'m getting a bite of that little -- what is that?\\n\\nCHOI:  It\\'s a little big bite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Little big bite.\\n\\nCHOI:  Favorite thing in the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, don\\'t say that.\\n\\nActually, I like that.\\n\\nCHOI:  It\\'s good, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aloha.  It just sounds magical.  Is there like pineapple in there?\\n\\nCHOI:  Yes. BOURDAIN:  Hence the aloha.  That\\'s a very tasty burger.  Nice char.\\n\\nCHOI:  Asian fast food.  It\\'s fast food, but it\\'s made like just a single family-owned restaurant.  Maybe not your family.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCHOI:  You like it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s actually very tasty.\\n\\nCHOI:  Every single thing you like it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow, there\\'s so much I don\\'t know.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(INAUDIBLE)\\n\\nCHOE:  That\\'s true, dad.

He beat me up, I beat him up, and then he would just cry.\\n\\nShow you my dad\\'s painting.  Hey, dad.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?\\n\\nCHOE:  Hey, come over here for a second.  Would you paint this, dad, 30 years ago?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  1973.\\n\\nCHOE:  Every Christmas he unrolls it and just scotch-tapes it to the wall.  My mom\\'s the artist in the family now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So this is a family of artists?\\n\\n(voice-over):  The Choes are devout Christians, not unusual in the Korean community, but they are unusual in that they\\'re both artists of a sort.\\n\\nJane treats the house like an ongoing art projects, drawing sun grasses on pictures, stapling angels to day\\'s painting that have hung in the White House, getting crazy with the glue gun, adorning wreaths with happy meal toys, sticker bombing the kitchen with birds, cows, space ships piloted by her three boys.  She is relentlessly energetically and inarguably creative.\\n\\nCHOE:  She brainwashed me.  From the time, we were kids.  She was like you\\'re the best artist in the world.  You\\'re the best artist in the world.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You are.\\n\\nCHOE:  Oh, thanks.\\n\\nBut now she\\'s telling me she\\'s going to be the best in the world. She\\'s very competitive.  She says she\\'s going to destroy me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Awesome.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Food is ready.\\n\\nCHOE:  So you want to explain what everything is, mom?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The food I prepared tonight is very common Korean food, (INAUDIBLE).  This is beef with stew.\\n\\nCHOE:  Kimchi is looking fresh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, kimchi is fresh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Today is chestnut rice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No one has this kind of rice.\\n\\nCHOE:  Special rice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Special rice for Tony.\\n\\nCHOE:  And stuffed peppers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, that\\'s David\\'s favorite.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheongpomuk, seaweed and jelly Mung beans, chop suey, noodles, shiitake mushrooms and vegetables.  Avocado eggrolls, fried squid and shrimps.  Potato pancake.  Often, at the Choe\\'s house, there\\'s a few Mexican dishes sprinkled in as well.\\n\\nIt\\'s always a great meal.  I can tell you that.\\n\\nCHOE:  Thanks, mom.  This is delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is awesome.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCHOE:  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I love it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  During the riots of \\'92, Jim and Jane Choe worked as real estate agents and property managers, so the destruction in Koreatown had a direct impact on their lives.\\n\\nThe Choes watched from homes as the chaos unfolded on TV.  After the riots, Jim wrote a letter to the editor that was published in \"Los Angeles Times.\"\\n\\nJIM CHOE, FATHER:  I\\'m extremely angry with the LAPD, for their outrageous action.  Why the cops let looters run wild and rape our city, they somehow had time to bother Korean chef/owners guarding their stores.  How can the owner of a business just sit back and watch his life be burned to the ground?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  David would have a very different reaction.\\n\\nCHOE:  My brother stole a car, and we went into like all the neighborhoods, and then quickly realized it wasn\\'t like about race, it was just about people stealing stuff.\\n\\nBut we were out looting, causing chaos.  I don\\'t think we got anything good.  I think I got a TV stand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Was it life-changing for you?\\n\\nCHOE:  It\\'s like you grow up and things are explained.  Here\\'s the police, they\\'re not doing anything they\\'re supposed to do, just normal men and women of society acting like animals, and I was like oh, everything I\\'ve been taught and learned my whole life is disintegrated before my lives, but in the end.  We\\'re from great disasters come great things, right?  I mean, Koreatown burned down.  It\\'s like we own L.A. now.  It\\'s like half the L.A.\\n\\nJIM CHOE:  Now, it\\'s Korean culture, K-pop and Psy, all the over the world influence, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Filmmakers, all the top Korean film makers.\\n\\nCHOE:  What about me?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Artists, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sorry, David.  He\\'s incredible (ph).\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCHOE:  Today I went into all the different ways you guys used to beat us when we were kids, the stress positions like, you know?  All the Korean punishments.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What\\'s remarkable to me, every kid, I mean, all Korean kids, the same position, holding a book --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, that\\'s the way we learned from generation to generation.  We don\\'t know why.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  To take a peek into the dark heart of the Korean psyche, make it helps to get familiar with Han, a concept no non-Koreans can be difficult to fully grasp.\\n\\nCHOE:  All right.  You want it?  Here we go.  Han denotes a collective feeling of oppression and isolation in the face of overwhelming odds. It connotes aspects of lament and un-avenged injustice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nCHOE:  I some occasions, anthropologists had recognized Han as cultural specific medical condition.  Someone who denies of Han is said to have been died of --\\n\\n(SPEAKING KOREAN)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s heartburn.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I mean, it\\'s been described in a way that sounded benign.  This is a burning sense of injustice, besiegement and desire for revenge.\\n\\nCHOE:  The Han is the reason we are who we are, but also the same reason why I won\\'t marry a Korean woman.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You never know --\\n\\nCHOE:  I know, mom.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He\\'s cute. (END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Main drag of K-town, another mini mall among many.  Karaoke, no.\\n\\nCHOE:  This is the best dumpling spot in town.  My mom would just order all these dumplings and leave them on my door, because she\\'s not let in my house.\\n\\nI just said, where are you getting these?  My mom likes to withhold information.  I finally got it out of her.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Myung In Dumplings, where they served a mix between Korean and Chinese.  Each plate handmade to order by friends, opened in 2007 on Olympic Boulevard, it\\'s run by Yu Jin (ph), a Korean by way of a Shenyang province in China.\\n\\nCHOE:  I\\'m coming here for about two years now, there\\'s no one ever in here.  Every time I\\'ve ever come in.  I don\\'t understand how they\\'re open.  They\\'re the best dumpling you\\'ve ever had.  Maybe just people get them to go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Right.\\n\\nCHOE:  They all look like butt holes, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kind of, yes, pre-prolapse.\\n\\n(voice-over):  (INAUDIBLE) king dumpling.  Thick dough, stuffed to the gills with pork, kimchi, vegetables, precisely made, weighed and crimped.  Steam until soft, eat.\\n\\n(on camera):  Wow, nearly the size of your head.\\n\\nCHOE:  Yes, it\\'s like pizza.  I\\'ll eat them cold, too.  Save two and have them for dinner.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And mandu (ph), smaller with thinner dumpling skins served with red chili paste.\\n\\nCHOE:  That\\'s the dessert one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Wow.  Boy, these are delicious.\\n\\nThey are like so huge.\\n\\nSo would this be classically post-drinking food or pre-drinking food? Laid out of base of absorbent material --\\n\\nCHOE:  Yes, there\\'s a lot of bread here.  I don\\'t really drink.  Just falling to peer pressure here, just to be one of the cool guys, so --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I like this place already.  Good signage.  That\\'s important.\\n\\nCHOE:  The sign\\'s awesome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If that sign does not sing to you, then we cannot be friends.\\n\\nCHOE:  Mari, hi.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hi, David.  How are you?\\n\\nCHOE:  This is my Uncle Tony.  This is Mari.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hi, guys.\\n\\nCHOE:  This is Perry Kim aka Tom Cruise (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  More Koreans here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Some friends of Choe seem to favor this, they are a very thirsty and diverse bunch.\\n\\n(on camera):  Asking everybody the stretch position as a child.  Did you have to do?  Went right into it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stress position.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The speed with which they assume the position.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Water.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Water, wow.\\n\\nWhat if your arms get tired?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Make you do it again for 45 minutes to an hour.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole thing is doing it again.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Look, I\\'m not Korean, I\\'m not Asian, I\\'m a white boy from the suburbs, but I noticed something over time in my K- Town adventure.\\n\\nSimilar anecdotes, you might say.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, they have done this quite a bit.  They came up a new one.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I was very aware that all my Korean friends no matter how creative or successful seemed strangely haunted by something, but I never knew this.\\n\\n(on camera):  How do you do this?\\n\\nCHOE:  Oh, it goes up like this, and then it\\'s like opening up an umbrella inside someone.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Colleagues.\\n\\nYou think it\\'s hilarious and adults do that to each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What the hell that is about, I can only guess.\\n\\n(on camera):  Cheers.  Koreans gone bad.\\n\\nCHOE:  You\\'re Korean now officially.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Pretty much any Korean you meet anywhere, you can take it for granted they like food, that they are passionate about food, particularly their food, which of all the immigrant cuisines has probably been messed with the least.  Unlike many new arrivals, Koreans seem to have been the most unwilling to accommodate western tastes.  Maybe that\\'s why it took us so much time to love this stuff.\\n\\nBeverly tofu house, like so much of K-Town\\'s finer establishments, is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall.\\n\\nCHOI:  This is one of my favorite spots, where I\\'ve been coming for almost 20 years.  This is a soup that\\'s just like it\\'s kind of Korean but really more --\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is not a direct transplant from Korea.\\n\\nCHOI:  It became what we\\'re about to have here in L.A.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Interesting.\\n\\nCHOI:  It\\'s different because of the ingredients we couldn\\'t find, but never thinking about leaving the American palate just to make ourselves happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Sonsobu (ph) is the thing to get, a fiery, tongue-searing, ass-burning tofu soup that will make you forget every bad thing you ever thought about tofu.\\n\\nA spicy, spicy red broth of tofu as the base.  We\\'re taking soft tofu here, with a texture like boratta and from there a handful of variations.  But the most common is with kimchi with everything -- beef, oysters, mussels, clams, oh, table size.  They crack an egg in there.\\n\\n(on camera):  Wow.  Right in there, cool.\\n\\nThat looks completely awesome.  Well, we better wait for this to cool.\\n\\nSo how do we eat this, spoon it over rice? CHOI:  Spoon it over rice.  Just mix it in.\\n\\nThat\\'s good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nAll tofu should be spicy by my way of thinking.  So good.\\n\\nCHOI:  Yes.  Really.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Koreans can well remember when nobody was interested in their food.  Now, it\\'s confusingly au courant.  Must be strange for the owners to be doing what they are doing for years.\\n\\nCHOI:  Like, for example, like us sitting here like this, the questions that a lot of people are asking me in Korean, like I\\'m telling them, we\\'re filming, you know, we\\'re trying to show it, the number one question, they are not mad or vindictive.  The question is why?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Why wouldn\\'t we be interested?\\n\\nCHOI:  Why wouldn\\'t we be interested?  Why would you waste your time? There\\'s other things to do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s an extraordinarily beautiful and delicious things.\\n\\nCHOI:  That\\'s the thing.  The beauty is just already a given, already a part of fabric, so it\\'s like why congratulate you, you know? There\\'s no reason to congratulate you because this is like what we do.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It sounds awful honestly.  Totally enjoying this.\\n\\nCHOI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do your parents want you to be when you grow up?\\n\\nCHOI:  For me, a doctor, a lawyer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Obviously not a doctor or lawyer.  Did you finish college?\\n\\nCHOI:  I finished college and went to one year of law school and I walked out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  So you\\'re a bad Korean.\\n\\nCHOI:  I was a bad Korean.\\n\\nIf I was a mediocre accountant, it would be better than being a top chef.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  According to who?\\n\\nCHOI:  According to Korean culture, according to Korean uncles and aunts.  It doesn\\'t register that that is a profession, you know?  I wouldn\\'t have to explain myself if I just said I was a CPA.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nCHOI:  Never.  You know that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Still got some explaining to do.\\n\\nCHOI:  Still.  Just get it across that I cook, and that there was this phenomenon that happened on the streets of L.A. that changed and opened up Korean culture to the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  What does it mean to be Korean-American?  Does one create one\\'s own world?\\n\\nI don\\'t know that I\\'m any smarter about that now than when I first came to K-Town in the middle of the night to discover a strange and fabulous and delicious slice of America I had never known was there, but I\\'m trying to figure it out.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST:  I\\'ve always wanted to get as far away as possible from the place that I was born.  Far both geographically and spiritually.  To leave it behind.\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tangier, it\\'s Morocco.  But from 1923 through 1956, it was loosely governed by the major powers, in international zone.  For years, it seemed, everything was permitted, nothing was forbidden.  At the northern tip of Africa, a short ferry hop from Spain, Tangier was a magnet for writers, (INAUDIBLE) band, spies, and artists.\\n\\nIf you were a bad boy of your time, if you liked drugs, the kind of sex that was frowned upon at home, and an affordable lifestyle set against an exotic background, Tangier was for you.\\n\\nMatisse, Genest, William Burroughs.  Many have come this way, staying a while or hanging around, but no one stayed longer or became more associated with Tangier than the novelist and composer Paul Bowles. In works like \"The Sheltering Sky\" he created a romantic vision of Tangier that persists even today.  A dream that has become almost inseparable in the minds of many from reality.\\n\\nI\\'m here to find that dream city.  The place Burroughs referred to as \"Interzone.\"\\n\\nTangier, like I said was a city of ex-pats -- people with pasts, people who simply didn\\'t like where they were and crave somewhere and something else.\\n\\nThe Grand Socco is the gateway to the Medina where you could find the Kasbah, which means fortress, by the way.  The Port of Tangier is to the east, and right in the middle of it all, the Petit Socco.  What Uncle Bill Burroughs called the last spot, the meeting place, the switchboard of Tangier.\\n\\nReasons for settling in Tangier diverge, but everyone sooner or later, since the beginning of memory, comes to Cafe Tingis.  Jonathan Dawson came to this city over 20 years ago as a journalist and he never left. He lives a live not too distant from Burroughs\\' fantasy.  Taking tea at 4:00 every day, served by his manservant.  He may not have a gazelle, but a pet rooster will do.  And every day he makes the rounds of the cafes, seeing all the old faces, ending up sooner or later here.\\n\\n(On camera):  So this is the Petit Socco?  JONATHAN DAWSON:  This is Petit Socco.  Yes.  This socco existed in Venetian times, it existed in Roman times, it existed in the Portuguese times.  The English were here for 22 years, then the international city until 1956, now it\\'s conflicting the problem.  This is very historic square.  Very historic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As a writer, I\\'ve noticed everybody who comes here to do an article does the same article.\\n\\nDAWSON:  It\\'s so damn boring.  They all do Paul Bowles and the beat generation and there are lots of other stories in the block apart from that.  But everyone likes the beats, Bill Burroughs, and all that stuff, and Tennessee Williams, and they were all here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nDAWSON:  But that\\'s a small part of Moroccan history.  That\\'s a 15- year page.  There was a life before that and a life after that. You\\'re here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  It was inevitable.  Let\\'s pretend that those guys never came.  What is -- what is this place?\\n\\nDAWSON:  Well, the reality is, if you can read the Paul Bowles story you can live it.  And people do come here and try and live it, but they don\\'t stay very long.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nDAWSON:  They smoke a little dope, and they\\'d go to a cheap hotel and they go home with bedbugs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nDAWSON:  That\\'s another life story.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And a great story.\\n\\nDAWSON:  And a great story.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I mean, the attitude here is different than other parts of Morocco.  I think they have a higher tolerance of tradition of bad or outrageous behavior.\\n\\nDAWSON:  They have a high tolerance of mad people, you know?  But the Moroccans essentially are very tolerant people.  They quite like madness as well.  They kind of celebrate that a bit, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How Moroccan is Tangier?\\n\\nDAWSON:  It\\'s a Moroccan city with a European outlook.  You know, you can stand up on the boulevard, you can see Spain and Gibraltar, so you\\'re going to see all sorts of people passing through but it\\'s a very Moroccan city.  I\\'m 62 years old.  I didn\\'t know international days which finished in 1956, but at that time I think Europeans may have outnumbered Moroccans in the center of this city.  It\\'s not the case now, there\\'s very few Europeans actually living here full time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The notion of living a life apart, of being somewhere else, there are those who like that feeling.  I like that feeling.  And then there are those who may live apart, they may live somewhere else, but they\\'re not entirely comfortable.  It\\'s the -- the difference annoys them or is a burden.\\n\\nDAWSON:  It did, and it frustrates them.  Some people have to leave home to find their home.  I\\'m one of those people.  Whereas I didn\\'t feel at home in the country I was born in at all.  But up here I feel OK.  I feel very, very happy here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There is indeed something special about this place.  Burroughs described the native corridor of Tangier as a maze of sunless twisting streets filled with blind alleys.  Its smell was particularly notable to him, including a mix of hashish, seared meat, and sewage.\\n\\nTangier, before anything else, is essentially a port city, with all the things that traditionally come with port cities.  It\\'s situated at the choke point between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The Moroccan Coast is a rich fishing ground, and a lot of people make their living from the sea.\\n\\nOn shore they use a method call senhal fishing, where weighted nets basically drag fish across the bottom of the sea.  Some of that fish, the good stuff, anyway, ends up here.  The Saveur de Poisson, or Restaurant Populare or Popeye\\'s.  The place has got a lot of names, but locals and ex-pats alike who\\'ve been coming here for years say it\\'s got some of the best Tagine in town.\\n\\nMohamed Belhadj, the owner and head chef in some of the nearby Rif mountains.  And he sources a lot of his stuff, his produce and his greens from there.  And he\\'s real proud of them.  The dark room of the place is dedicated to sorting and drying various herbs which he blends into a secret mix he claims has all sorts of healthful and boner- inspiring benefits.\\n\\nIf every dish I\\'ve been told over the years is going to make me strong worked, I\\'d have a permanent pup tent going on down there, so I take all that with a grain of salt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: .  Hi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Hello.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How are you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Belhadj\\'s son Hassan delivers the food.  It all starts with fresh olives.  They\\'re in season now.  And roasted walnuts.  Some warm, very good bread.  Oh yes, and you get this stuff. Everybody gets it.  A pulpy puree of figs, raisins, strawberries and full of Mohamed\\'s potent herbs and spices, of course.\\n\\nMOHAMED BELHADJ, OWNER:  All night, it cooks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, yes, yes, I get it.  It\\'s supposed to make me more manly.  You know what?  I\\'m eating.  Let\\'s not talk about that, OK, sunshine?  What is a Tagine anyway?  It\\'s a traditional Moroccan stew that can include vegetables, meat or fish.  Tonight, baby shark, calamari and monkfish, with fresh mountain spinach.  Slowly cooked over charcoal in the classic clay pot that gives it its name, the Tagine\\'s dome top.  It\\'s supposed to force the condensation back into the dish and keep it moist and tender.\\n\\n(On camera):  It\\'s delicious.  I think it\\'s -- with these greens and the aromatics and herbs, I have no idea what they are.  I\\'ve never had anything like that.  The Tangier version of farm to table.\\n\\nWow, what is that?  Thank you.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And a whole turbo, brushed with olive oil, salt and pepper and some coriander, then grilled perfectly over the coals. Cuddled up next to the fish, tiny shark kebabs.  Cute.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow, spectacular.  It\\'s good value.  All of this for 20 bucks?  We actually did a pretty good on Mr. Fish.  That will teach you.\\n\\nHe\\'s freaking me out now.  It\\'s like that guy with, you know, you\\'re tripping, and he goes like this to you?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  For dessert, strawberries, pine nuts and honey.  Like the whole meal, it\\'s eccentric and delicious.\\n\\n(On camera):  Thank you.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I haven\\'t had so much fruits and nuts since Altaban.  I told Mick, I said, Mick, this is a bad crowd.  Back of the shop, but he\\'s like, man, we can\\'t disappoint the fans.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  \"In Tangier, I lived in one room in the native quarter.  I have not taken a bath in a year nor changed my clothes or removed them, except to stick a needle every hour in the fibrous gray wooden flesh of terminal addiction.  I never cleaned or dusted the room.  Empty ampoule boxes and garbage piled up to the ceiling.  Life and water long since turned off for nonpayment.\\n\\nI did absolutely nothing.  I could look at the end of my shoes for eight hours.  I was only roused to action when the hourglass of junk ran out.\"\\n\\nThe words of William Seward Burroughs, one of my heroes.  He came to Tangier in 1953, shortly after shooting his wife to death in a drunken accident in Mexico City.  He was a heroin addict, a homosexual and an inspiration to those proto-hipsters who became known as the beast. Burroughs, however, was not a hipster.  There was nothing beatnik about him.\\n\\nHe was a somewhat stuffy, well-dressed St. Louis son of a good family gone wrong.  He was also to my mind the greatest writer of the whole damn bunch.\\n\\nOn the road, you can have it.  His classic \"Naked Lunch\" was written here.  A nonlinear, dark, dry humored searingly critical and satirical and profane masterpiece.  Burroughs was apparently high for much of the process, on heroin or a locally valuable opiate called Eukodol. And of course the daily staple in many of these parts, hashish, kief, and Majoon.\\n\\nHashish is the concentrated THC-rich resin of the cannabis plant, as well as varying amounts of its flowers and leaves that had been separated from the buds and compressed into sheet or brick-like form. Kief, a more local and indigenous product, is the part of the plant containing only the strongest concentration of psychoactive ingredients.  Majoon is a confection made from kief, fruits, nuts, chocolate and honey.\\n\\nI was, of course, fascinated by this product since reading about it and inquired of some local contacts, who shall necessarily go unnamed.\\n\\nHow was it made?  This is what I wanted to know.\\n\\nThey were kind enough to demonstrate.  Kief is first chopped into fine granules and then slowly added to melted butter and chocolate over a low heat to toast it and release the psychotropic goodies within. While the binder element of the majoon is slow-cooking in the plan, combination of spices are blended with cashews, almonds, walnuts and dried fruit.  This will be the framework to suspend the THC-laden goodness in the next step.\\n\\nThe cannabis-laced butter chocolate is added along with plenty of honey to bind together all the ingredients.  Then mix.  Last, you roll the entirety of the mixture into a ball and either refrigerate or dig right in.\\n\\nOf course, network standards and practices prohibit me from even tasting this delicious and reportedly mind-altering treat.  I\\'m guessing, anyway.  So until I see Christiane and Wolf doing bong riffs in \"THE SITUATION ROOM,\" I will of course abide by these rules because that\\'s the kind of guy I am.\\n\\nThere is one particular cafe in the heart of the Kasbah that has drawn in foreign dignitaries, rock stars, aristocrats and artists since it opened its doors in 1943.  Cafe Baba.  Sweet mint tea in a thick slow- moving haze of smoke.  It smells like my dorm room 1972.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good evening, hello.\\n\\nGEORGE BAJALIA:  I\\'m George.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (Voice-over):  This is George Bajalia and Zaneb Benjalum (ph).\\n\\n(On camera):  Thank you for having me.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  Yes.  And welcome to Cafe Baba.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  I should say right now, I have no direct knowledge or awareness of either George or Zaneb smoking any illegal substances nor do I have any contemporary news recollection at this time of me doing anything untoward in their presence because that would be, like, wrong, dude.\\n\\nGeorge is here on a Fulbright scholarship and Zaneb is an artist from (INAUDIBLE).  Others in the room, however, well, don\\'t give me that innocent look, you young punks.  I know somebody in here is smoking reefer.\\n\\n(On camera):  So how stoned are people here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We can ask, just ask.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, you\\'re not getting totally ripped here?\\n\\nBAJALIA:  No.  It\\'s a functional part of daily life.  For a long time, the rest of the country and the government didn\\'t really like Tangier a whole lot.  It was seedy.  There were these foreigners who came here and --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBAJALIA:  He likes Tangier.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He likes.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  Yes.  It makes money.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He sees it as a future economic super power, as I understand it.  He\\'s talking condos, boutique, hotels.  Is that good or bad?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  For Moroccans, it\\'s work.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But of course ex-pats want to keep Tangier like they know it before.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  I mean, this cafe is very similar to the way it was, but there\\'s a TV right there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Flat screen.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  And that\\'s why people -- a lot of people come here.  They come to watch soccer games.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You can well imagine the American guy who\\'s lived in Tangier for 30 years.  OK?  He comes in and there\\'s a flat screen TV on the wall, he\\'s like, what the --\\n\\nBAJALIA:  Yes, what?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'ve ruined the authenticity and the integrity, but the Moroccan guy at the next table is like, wait a minute, wait a minute, asshole, do you have a flat screen TV at home?  I want one, too. What\\'s wrong with that?\\n\\nBAJALIA:  Yes.  There are people here who probably have never heard of (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  If you only follow that, there\\'s no progression, there\\'s no progress, there\\'s no change.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The thing about Cafe Baba is just sitting here, taking in the atmosphere, you begin to appreciate the place.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  There\\'s something different is happening here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Contact high, whoa, I\\'m hungry.  Wait until the Spanish tortilla dude across the street opens for business.\\n\\nThis is Abdelileh.  He specializes in making one thing and he makes it well.  An omelet.  Well, it\\'s actually more like a Spanish tortilla but like stonier.  The potatoes are boiled, diced, they\\'re mixed with beaten eggs and cooked in a cast iron skillet.  Yes, the eggs, the eggman, I am me and we are you, and where is my omelet, dude, because I am hungry?\\n\\nBAJALIA:  One, two, three?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Abdelileh is just waiting for you right when you come stumbling out of Cafe Baba.  Coincidence or not?  You be the judge.\\n\\nBAJALIA:  Ketchup and mayonnaise.  Everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ketchup and mayonnaise?  Sure, why not.  Condiment options I would be hard pressed to turn down at this precise moment anyway.\\n\\n(On camera):  Dude, that\\'s awesome.  I\\'ll have 12 more.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Paul Bowles lived in Tangier for over 50 years, and Sherry Nutting was part of his inner circle through the end of his life.  She was his friend, record keeper of sorts, and photographer.\\n\\n(On camera):  You arrived when?\\n\\nSHERRY NUTTING:  I came in the \\'70s, but I went down to Marrakesh. Then in \\'86, I wrote a letter to Paul Bowles and said I had to meet him and take his picture.  And he wrote back and he said, come and visit.  Well, I never left.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Like a lot of people came here to live that dream, or to live that life.  Has the reality come to resemble his perception of the reality or --\\n\\nNUTTING:  The Tangier that I see is Paul Bowles.  And I still feel it. I still feel it.  You can still find the magic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The market or souk in Tangier is one of the best in all Morocco.  The food stalls and vendors are still pretty impressive.  Wander the markets long enough and you\\'re sure to stumble across the unexpected.  Whose?  Sure.  How about a lancet?  Here nothing goes to waste.  Charbroiled to crispy burnt perfection the meat is scraped off and served on a crunchy lunch bread.\\n\\nNot so adventurous, the Grant Socco\\'s indoor market offers a variety of smoked, cured and fresh meat.\\n\\n(On camera):  Smells good in here.  The stuff looks good.  I\\'ve heard this cheese is amazing.\\n\\nNUTTING:  It\\'s good.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Could I have one?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  A Berber favorite, fresh goat cheese wrapped in palm leaves.\\n\\nNUTTING:  Yes, they\\'re beautiful, aren\\'t they?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  A little cheese, a little flatbread, the perfect Moroccan breakfast to go.  We\\'re headed to the Jabala foothills of the Rif mountain range, about 85 kilometers south of Tangier, to a place called Jajouka.  The village is home to the people of the al-Sharif tribe, which loosely translated means the saintly people.\\n\\nJajouka is also home to one of Morocco\\'s better-known musicians, Bachir Attar.  Jazz and rock and roll musicians have traveled from all over the world to Jajouka to meet this guy.  Bachir is part of a lineage of master musicians, all from this small mountain village.\\n\\nFamously dubbed as a 4,000-year-old rock band by William Burroughs, Bashir, his son and these musicians maintain one of the oldest still living musical traditions on earth.\\n\\nWe\\'re invited for dinner.  It\\'s family style, of course, beginning with bray wine, like a kefta pocket.  Hand-formed envelopes of dough filled with seasoned beef, baked until golden, then crisped in oil.\\n\\n(On camera):  I\\'m good for now -- well, one more.  Here we go.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The main event, Tagine of chicken.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  Just gorgeous.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  First, chopped onions, garlic, parsley and turmeric are blended with olive oil.  The bird is generously coated and stuffed then after simmering in a touch of olive oil and water, the chicken is fried until crispy, served with roasted almonds and olives, paprika and ginger.  Nice.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It smells the food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like anywhere else in the Arab world, eating with your hands, always the right one, is proper dining etiquette.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is special spinach of Jajouka.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  These are wild spinach.  It grows in the mountains?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Vocalized chopped mountain spinach.  Garlic, cilantro, hot and black peppers, finished with lemon and olive oil.\\n\\n(On camera):  That\\'s delicious.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The greatest taste for food in the world, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I love good food.  This is good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  After dinner some fruit, some mint tea, and let the music begin.  For centuries, the master musician of Jajouka have been the musical choice of the royal families of Morocco, excused by the country\\'s rulers from manual labor to devote themselves to musical training.\\n\\nThe powerful style of Sufi transmusic has inspired many music seekers, including, most notably perhaps, Paul Bowles, who wrote about them and recorded them, and spread the word.\\n\\nBrian Jones was here and recorded \"The Pipes of Pan at Jajouka\" with these musicians.  The word spread, and the master musicians have ended up being featured on albums by Maceo Parker, Ornette Coleman, and the Rolling Stones.\\n\\nFor years, if you were a rock god, you had to come here, dig the crazy percussion and strings and pipes that took you to another place.  It\\'s intricate, hypnotic, beautiful.  And if you\\'re in the right frame of mind, mesmerizing.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Anyone who comes to Tangier inevitably ends up lost in the old part of the city.  The Medina is just what you want it to be.  The ancient world residing just next to and around the new one.  You can walk around inside the movie in your head, play the bogie character you never were, all against an all too willing, all too genuine backdrop.\\n\\nOrdinarily just about the last thing in the world I\\'d be interested in doing is antiquing, but buried in the network of twisting narrow streets of the old city is Boutique Majid, owned and operated and personally curated by this man, Abedelmajid Rais El Fenni, and he\\'s one interesting guy.\\n\\n(On camera):  Thank you.\\n\\nABEDELMAJID RAIS EL FENNI, BOUTIQUE MAJID:  Come in.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When he was a little kid back in the \\'60s, Majid left his hometown of Fez and came here, where he\\'d earned a few dirham a night emptying ashtrays at the wild and extravagant parties being thrown here by wealthy ex-pats.  He saw what these people would buy for themselves and how they decorate their homes.  And he started to look around for himself, scoring, then reselling art and antiques.\\n\\nIt became something of an obsession.  Now his artifacts from Morocco and all across northern Africa are bought by collectors from all over the world.  Carpets, antiques, wood carvings, jewelry, and old doors.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow, these are incredibly beautiful.\\n\\nMAJID:  Tell me about that.  Amber, coral, shells.  These used to be currency in Tangier.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How old is this?\\n\\nMAJID:  This is early \\'20s, late \\'19s.  The amber is millions of years old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How much are you selling this piece for?\\n\\nMAJID:  By weight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By weight.\\n\\nMAJID:  Yes, it\\'s quite heavy.  This one, 429 grams, so it comes like 42,000 dirhams.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So that\\'s how much in dollars?\\n\\nMAJID:  Like almost $5,000.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Above $5,000.\\n\\nMAJID:  Almost.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Should we look at another floor?\\n\\nMAJID:  Oh, yes, follow me.  There\\'s a nice collection of things from the Sahara.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you travel a lot?\\n\\nMAJID:  Not like you.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, this is for pounding (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nMAJID:  Yes, this is from the Gon tribe from Mali.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How much will this sell for?\\n\\nMAJID:  Around $300.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  For this?  That\\'s very reasonable.\\n\\nMAJID:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll be buying that.  That\\'s going to be an old friend.\\n\\nMAJID:  Also memory.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And a memory.\\n\\nMAJID:  Of Tangier.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of Tangier as well.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Majid suggests lunch at Andalus, a local\\'s only place nearby.\\n\\n(On camera):  As a Moroccaner, so many Westerners who come to Tangier come with a romantic notion of the Tangier they read about in books. Do people have a realistic expectation when they come here?  Are they looking for Morocco?  Are they looking for phantasm?\\n\\nMAJID:  It is a phantasm.  It is when you get here, you know Morocco, you feel that you are in Morocco, but you\\'re not.  There\\'s a lot of Mediterranean touch to this town.  And also the history, people hear stories about Tangier that was -- like when I first came in the \\'60s, everybody said to me you came late.  Tangier war.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s -- right.\\n\\nMAJID:  Now I\\'m saying the same thing this young -- they come and they saw wow, I said.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was better about those days?\\n\\nMAJID:  Well, for me at that time I was young, and it was the boom of hippies, and it was a destination, you know, Cafe Baba, you meet Bob Dylan, you go in and catch -- the parties was going on.  I miss these kind of parties.  People would fly from everywhere to the party, and they make the whole town move.  Blue and white party, white and gold party, hat party, you know, it\\'s amazing.\\n\\nYou see people coming in with amazing hats, like a cage with a bird, extravagant hats, you know.  They put so much energy and time into these parties, you know?  Look at --  BOURDAIN:  Now that looks good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Tomatoes brushed with local olive oil, garlic and coriander.  Liver kebabs, beef liver to be exact, grilled over charcoal.\\n\\n(On camera):  That looks very nice.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  For fish, a bit of swordfish and some orange roughy.\\n\\n(On camera):  That is just beautiful.\\n\\nMAJID:  How do you like the tomato?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The swordfish is amazing.\\n\\nMAJID:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how else have things changed?\\n\\nMAJID:  You saw how many tourists there was today?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They were in a hurry.\\n\\nMAJID:  If they come to the shop, even try to avoid you eye contact. If you get my eye contact, I\\'m going to rip you off --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or make you buy something that they don\\'t want?\\n\\nMAJID:  I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t know.  They have this --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do they buy?\\n\\nMAJID:  They don\\'t even say hello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They don\\'t buy.\\n\\nMAJID:  Of course.  We call them penguins.  They have short hands that doesn\\'t get to the pockets.  No, I\\'m just kidding.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  When Tangier was Interzone back in the day, it seemed to some I\\'m sure as if the ex-pats outnumbered the locals. That was never true, but you certainly could live a life apart, make your own world within the existing one.  Reinvent yourself and live entirely within a universe of your own creation.\\n\\nFar from the Grand Socco is a 14-acre estate owned by Christopher Gibbs, a well-known dealer of antiques and longtime ex-pat.  Today he\\'s having a garden party.\\n\\nWho\\'s coming?  Jonathan, you know.  Maggie Dean is from Scotland. She\\'s been living here for more than a decade.  GP (INAUDIBLE), a Frenchman who has his  hand on a lot of businesses, including a cafe in the Kasbah.  Years living in Tangier unknown.  Bianca Hamre (ph), an American, she\\'s been here forever, led many lives, I gather, and occasionally translate books from Magrabi to English, and the dashing and mysterious Baron de Corcuera Gandarillas, an artist from Chile who\\'s been living and working in the Kasbah since a hasty exit from Puerto Rico for reasons never fully explained.\\n\\nOn the menu, bastilla, a meat or often pigeon pie as traditional Moroccan as it gets.  Today made by Gibbs\\' full-time cooks, Jamilla and Fatama.  In bastilla, the meat on this particular day is chicken, which is slow-cooked in broth and spices, pulled or shredded, and then folded into an egg mixture cooked in a reduced stock from the boil. This is layered with blanched almonds, powdered sugar and cinnamon. And then the whole lot is then wrapped in a (INAUDIBLE), a crepe-like dough.  After baking to a golden crispiness, the final touch is a dusting of even more cinnamon and sugar.  It\\'s got a sweet savory thing going on, and it\\'s quite tasty.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you get nervous when you go in a room and you touch the light switch and the lights don\\'t come on, you shouldn\\'t be in this country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  What was that first moment when you said, you know, I could live here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m still quite unsure about that.  I came here first in 1958.  When it was quite different.  Everyone wore native dress, but Islam still the throbbing motor of life here.  I have a very tender feelings for Morocco and the friendliness and courtesy of the people and its children who -- they say, bonjour, monsieur.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I always feel welcome here.  I never consider that this is mine.  It\\'s theirs and they have allowed me to live here in a very nice way, and I feel recognition.  They know who I am.  They know who I am.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is a side-by-side aspect to life here that\\'s very unusual.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Very unusual here.  It\\'s mostly -- you can do whatever you want if you do it with good manners.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But it is sort of a station of the cross for, you know, bad boys of culture.  I mean, Rambo, the Stones, Guyson.  Burroughs writes about it.  He came here to be a writer.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He was a junky before he\\'s a writer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As so many of us were.  You want to think of yourself as a writer, you would come here and somehow you were working within a romantic tradition, Burroughs said right up front, to me a writer -- from when I was a little boy, a writer was a guy who lunged around in a smoking jacket or a caftan smoking a hash pipe or an opium pipe in a beautifully anointed house boat littered with sleeping boys.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Or girls.  (LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To what extent did that world exist and to what extent was that were created by people who showed up with that expectation?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Since Bill departed, RIP, dear, wonderful, marvelous man, since he\\'s gone, it\\'s been tamed now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is tame.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He was --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Genteel now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He was the very opposite of genteel.  He was an outlaw.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My husband knew him very well, and he was selling the yes, Bill, and I said, he said I cured him of being a drug addict.  I said how?  He said I turned him into an alcoholic.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who smokes hashish at this table, please raise your hand?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Is the camera on?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s my last night in Tangier, and I\\'m headed out.  Most cities in the Islamic world getting a beer can be difficult.  Not here.  As long as you\\'re outside the Medina, nearly anything goes.  Tangier reverts to its libertine past.  Here, Western influences become very apparent.\\n\\nAny night of the week is good nights for young Moroccans to take to the streets of the Ville Nouveau.  Othman Noussairi is from a generation of Moroccans far removed from the romantic unseats of the Bowles-Burroughs era.  He\\'s invited me out for a casual snack, bocadillas, Spanish-style sandwiches with tuna, veggies, hard-cooked eggs and a healthy wad of mayo, a crispy layer of French fries within the sandwich.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is delicious, by the way.  The bread here is very good.  You work in magazine, journalist?\\n\\nOTHMAN NOUSSAIRI, OWNER, URBAN MAGAZINE:  I\\'m not a journalist, but I own an urban magazine here in Tangier.  To inform Moroccans, we are living in a place that\\'s pretty special, it\\'s not for any purpose that William Burroughs or Paul Bowles or Henri Matisse, all these people came to Tangier.  The city has something which makes it different from other cities.  BOURDAIN:  Well, what about young artists, young writers, young musicians?  Did they come here expecting this romantic Paul Bowles wonderland of the \\'50s?\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  Some were.  Some were -- I\\'m going to say too Bohemian.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Too Bohemian.\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  Yes.  Because they thought that\\'s like, you know, coming and being an artist.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is going to be enough.\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  Is going to be enough.  Today it\\'s not enough.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  Yes.\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  It\\'s pretty tough for them, and most of them packed their bags.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  Today we have so many investments going on here in Tangier, thanks to our king.  Investors are here.  Have attracted -- tourists are attracted, but the most important part of it is that we should keep the old parts of the city intact.  The Kasbah, the Medina.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Medina.\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  That\\'s was hard to do because when you have a European purchasing power coming over here to Tangier --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They come, well, like we come.  We embrace it.  Other people want to come, and then we roll out.  Will Tangier\\'s unique character survive?\\n\\nNOUSSAIRI:  I hope so.  I really hope so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tangier is Morocco.  Always was Morocco and recently the country\\'s leadership has embraced it, in all its ill- reputed glory.  The days of predatory poets in search of literary inspiration and young flesh are probably over for good.  Hippies can just as easily get their bong riffs in Portland or Peoria, but the good stuff, the real good stuff, the sounds and smells and the look of Tangier, but you see and hear when you lean out the window and take it all in, that\\'s here to stay.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, HOST (voice-over):  It takes a special breed to live in a province like Quebec.  It gets cold in winter, and winters are long.  It takes a special kind of person for whom frozen rivers, icy wind-whipped streets, deep seemingly endless forests are the norm.\\n\\nI will confess my partisanship up front.  I love Montreal.  It is my favorite place in Canada.  The people who live there are tough, crazy bastards, and I admire them for it.  Toronto, Vancouver, I love you, but not like Montreal.  Why?  I shall explain.  All will be revealed. In the meantime, check this guy out.\\n\\n(On camera):  What\\'s the Post Office\\'s motto?  Neither rain nor sleet nor driving snow nor plague of locusts prevent the mail carrier from delivering my junk mail?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Here in Montreal, the simple task of delivering the mail in winter comes with its own set of hurdles.  Icy hurdles.\\n\\n(On camera):  I got to ask, do you have special equipment for this?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'ve got on, like, slip on boots.  We do have our boots in the rains -- sorry, when it gets icy with the spikes on them. And they give us also slip on the spikes for when it\\'s icy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any sort of city ordinance that you have to shovel or -- they\\'re not penalized financially?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, nothing like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Any injuries in the line of duty?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'ve had several, like, tumbles, one incident I was off for two months.  I thought I broke my ankle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is the most perilous aspect of the job?  Would it be dogs or icy stairs?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In this area there\\'s a lot of dogs, but I would say icy stairs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  It\\'s one thing to have to work outside in this wintry mess, but it takes a strange and wonderful kind of mutant to actually find it pleasurable like, well, these two gentlemen.\\n\\n(On camera):  Do you like the cold?  I mean, by you, I mean the Quebecoise.\\n\\nFRED MORIN, CO-OWNER, JOE BEEF:  It cleans the streets of (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The cold?\\n\\nMORIN:  Yes.\\n\\nDAVE MCMILLAN, CO-OWNER, JOE BEEF:  The frigid cold keeps the riffraff out of the city, for sure.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Fred Morin and Dave McMillan, restaurateur, chefs at the legendary Joe Beef, (speaking in foreign language), historians of their beloved great white north, princes of hospitality.\\n\\nAnd what do men like these do for fun when the rivers turned to ice three-feet thick, when testicles shrink and most of us scurry for warmth and shelter?  If they were like so many other Canadians, they would go ice fishing on the St. Lawrence River.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  The cabin fever induces in the Quebecoise family because we are confined perhaps to spend so much time indoors.  A lot of the families love to do, you know, activities together, like this, go to the cottage, goes ice fishing, you know, it gets you out of the house. And it\\'s very much a family thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like many of their ilk, they seek one of the temporary small towns of sled-born cabins, drill a hole in the ice, and wait. But these are not normal men.\\n\\n(On camera):  So is Quebec better than the rest of Canada?\\n\\nMORIN:  Obviously.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, come on.  You can\\'t think about that long.\\n\\nMORIN:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now wait a minute.  Now are strippers paid hourly here?  Is that right?  It\\'s not a tip system?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s considered an art -- a performance art.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You consider it a performance art.  So how does that work? You don\\'t --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  You pay for a song.  You pay for a song.  And then --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You pay per song.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  And then you can get a dance in the back, which is a private dance.  And that\\'s 10 bucks a song, five bucks a song in public.\\n\\nMORIN:  That\\'s why I go to (INAUDIBLE) strip because the songs are super-long.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI\\'m a bit (INAUDIBLE).  You know, I go for the king shrimp and lap dance.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  After a suspiciously stunned-looking fish emerges from the deep, previously whoof (ph) and all by an eager producer no doubt, it is ignored, because Fred and Dave do things differently.  No crudely fried fish and bread crumbs for these large living 19th Century men.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow.  Holy shit.  Look at that.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Instead, a hearty lunch of French classics, accompanied by many fine wines and liqueurs, as befitting gentlemen of discerning taste who\\'ve exhausted themselves in the wild.\\n\\n(On camera):  So this is how you live?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Well, more often than not, yes.\\n\\nMORIN:  We always have to travel well and eat properly.  We\\'re taking a natural white wine, (INAUDIBLE), white burgundy.  These are Glaser bay oysters as well as a couple Boujelois thrown in there.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  They\\'re delicious in my prized possession those little --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  I mean, the funnest part about the restaurant business isn\\'t the cutlery.  It\\'s just the spoon is absolutely gorgeous.  You know, Fred has a wonderful collection of tableware.  Without getting, you know, snobby or elitist, you know, eating off vintage tableware is one of the great joys out of life.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, this is the interesting paradox of you guys.  You aspire to -- to run a democratic establishment, and yet you are hopeless romantics when it comes to --\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Painful nostalgics.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The art of living.  Right?  What the --\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Sustenance is required.\\n\\n(On camera):  Holy -- look at this.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Like say a consomme of oxtail to begin.  Followed perhaps by a chilled lobster a la Parisian?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  The art of dining is kind of disappearing much to our chagrin.  I work super hard at being an excellent dining companion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  When seeking excellence in a dining companion, what qualities does one look for?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  I turn my phone off.  I -- you know, I never put my elbows on the table.  I don\\'t --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Of course.  Come prepared with stories.  Don\\'t drink too much, don\\'t become sloppy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come prepared with anecdotes?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No elbows on the table?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  No, it\\'s not -- it\\'s not proper.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m a total failure as a dining companion.  What is that?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  What\\'s that, you ask?  An iconic (INAUDIBLE) era classic of gastronomy?\\n\\n(On camera):  Look at that sauce.  Holy crap.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The devilishly difficult (INAUDIBLE) ala Royale, a boneless wild hair, in a sauce of its own blood, a generous heaping of fresh black truffle, garnished with thick slabs of foie gras, seared directly on the top of the cabin\\'s wood stove.\\n\\n(On camera):  Damn, look at that.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  We\\'re in a wooden shack, over three feet of ice, and 100 feet of water.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You are hopeless, hopeless romantics, gentlemen.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that.  Oh.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The seared foie is perched atop in ethereal suspension of Joe (INAUDIBLE) inspired potato puree.  Of course.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  This is (INAUDIBLE) from (INAUDIBLE) Vineyard by Teddy (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Nice.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  That\\'s wonderful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, yes, it is.  Really, is there a -- is there billionaire or a despot anywhere out on Earth who at this precise moment is eating better than us?  MCMILLAN:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.  Look at that.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  (Speaking in foreign language)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Cheese.  There must be cheese.  In this case, a voluptuously reeking Epoisses, who some less hardy outdoors might call overripe, but not us.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is awesome.  What do we have here?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  A few Cuban.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wait a minute, you guys have a much more relaxed attitude towards the importation of Cuban cigars.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Chartreuse, of course, and a desert as rare as it gets, a dinosaur era monster long believed extinct.\\n\\nMORIN:  This is Gateau Marjolaine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Who does this?\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s one of those, like, painful nostalgic things.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Layers of almond and hazelnut meringue, chocolate butter cream.\\n\\n(On camera):  My god, look at that.  Damn, that\\'s good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  For these guys, this is normal.  This is lunch.\\n\\nMORIN:  Some days it\\'s like playhouse in my house, it\\'s French playhouse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Yes, what do you do?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  They get dressed at their house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No way.  Tell me all about it.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  The kids, too.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He\\'s a dandy.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  He\\'s a dandy.\\n\\nMORIN:  A Sunday dandy.  Last time I did, I did (INAUDIBLE), primrose and the Linzer Torte, I made (INAUDIBLE) caramel, I made salad a la orange.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMORIN:  I made (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMORIN:  With a creme fraiche, and then a huge cheese curd that was about like 15 kinds of cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  And how many people are in your family at this meal?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Him and his wife, and two young boys.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And how old are the kids?\\n\\nMORIN:  Two and 4.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you, your wife and a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old.\\n\\nMORIN:  They don\\'t make it to the end, usually, after like -- I have to like prematurely open --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  They don\\'t like (INAUDIBLE)?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And I\\'m thinking this, and I\\'m think, well, that\\'s really tough, but I\\'m also thinking, you know, I\\'ve got to do that.  I want to do that.  And actually my daughter would totally be into it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Once every few decades, maybe every century, a nation will produce a hero.  An Escoffiere, a Muhammad Ali, a Dalai Lama, a Joey Marrone, someone who changes everything about their chosen field, who changes the whole landscape.  Life after them is never the same.\\n\\nMartin Picard is such a man.  A here-to-for, an encounter hybrid of rugged outdoorsman, veteran chef, with many years of fine dining experience.  Renegade, innovator, he is one of the most influential chefs in North America.  He is also a proud Quebecois, and perhaps he more than everyone else has defined for a new generation of Americans and Canadians what that means.\\n\\nHe\\'s an unlikely ambassador for his country and his province.  Maybe not so unlikely.  I mean, look at him.  Out for a day, trapping beaver with local trapper Carl.\\n\\n(On camera):  So the bait is wood?\\n\\nMARTIN PICARD, CHEF:  Yes, just the bark.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They eat the bark?  PICARD:  Yes, yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I understand in pioneer days, beaver was the financial engine of Canada?\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Empires were built on it.  Every hat practically in the world was made of a beaver pelt.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s why today it\\'s the icon of Canada.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  To a lesser extent, the tradition continues today.  Carl continues to trap, usually called on by provincial officials to trap beaver and clear away dams and control what could become an destructively over populated situation.\\n\\n(On camera):  Hello, my little friend.\\n\\nPICARD:  This is a young one.  And those are the ones we want to eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What would you compare the meat to?  Is there anything like it.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s the thing, you know, there\\'s nothing like it.  You know, when you eat beaver, you understand that it\\'s beaver.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Martin, along with an encyclopedic knowledge of fine wines and an attachment to the music of Celine Dion, is a big believer in honoring history and tradition.  If you still trap beavers, you should, if at all possible, cook them and eat them, not just strip them of their pelts.  And as incredible as it might seem, you can cook beaver really, really well.\\n\\nBeaver tail, on the other hand, is not actually beaver at all, rather a quick spoonbread type of thing that in our case goes somewhat awry during an inadvertent inferno.\\n\\n(On camera):  The sauce, it almost looks like chocolate.  So rich looking, huh?\\n\\nPICARD:  I love it.  When it\\'s like this.  Some people don\\'t put too much blood, but I like when it\\'s very thick.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  It\\'s absolutely delicious.\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes, it is.  I wasn\\'t joking about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It tastes like chicken.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNo, it doesn\\'t take like chicken at all.\\n\\nPICARD:  This is your first time?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nPICARD:  Wow.  That\\'s something.  I think you almost eat everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, at this point, you know animals, they see me and they\\'re like oh --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPICARD:  No, no.  Not him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Not that guy.\\n\\n(On camera):  There\\'s a joke around here somewhere, but to tell you the truth, the stuff is just too good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  It\\'s like 10 below zero in this freaking town.  And that generally does not spell good time for me.  A good time for me is more like a palm tree, a beach, a swimming pool, with only cold thing is my beer.  But no.  These hearty culinarians of the north like to frolic in the snow and ice.  More accurately they like to obey their genetic Quebecois imperative to risk dental and maxillofacial injury, by skating around, slapping at a hard disk, trying to drive it in each other\\'s general direction.\\n\\nI believe they call this sport hockey.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is not in my blood.  Do you skate?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes, we grew up on rinks like this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Does everyone in Quebec, it\\'s pretty much obligatory?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s your stick, kid.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  What else can you do?  There\\'s no reason to live here if there\\'s no hockey.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Hockey rinks pop up all over the city to accommodate Montreal\\'s desire to risk teeth, groin and limb.  And right behind Fred and Dave\\'s restaurant Joe Beef, a pickup game of chefs, cooks and hospitality professionals is under way.\\n\\n(On camera):  Some of these guys have put (INAUDIBLE) a little long and a tooth to be out there, swinging sticks at each other and skidding around in the ice.  This is normal behavior.  People actually do this for fun?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  This is every day Quebecois, growing up, playing hockey.  Canadian national sport, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  And this young one is already being indoctrinated. Hello, young man.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  You want to play?  Are you good at hockey?  Are you going to be a goalie or a player?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A player.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  A player.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Am I going to get, like, a mouth full of puck, by the way?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Being catered with Fred and Dave\\'s usual restraint.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Come eat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hot coco in Styrofoam cups?  No, try a titanic Chucrute Garni ala (INAUDIBLE), containing Flintstone-sized hunks of pork belly, (INAUDIBLE), bacon, homemade Boudin Blanc, kielbasa, smoked chops, plus veal and pork links.\\n\\n(On camera):  Oh, yes, this is a truly heroic Chucrute.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Look at that beautiful work of linking (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This dish is the single best argument for sharing a border with Germany.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And, of course, the finest wines known to humanity.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  German wine, Silvaner, in pirate bottles.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Sweet.  What am I drinking here?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Canadian Riesling.  This is Norman Hardie Riesling from Prince Albert County five hours from here.  Amazing wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  There\\'s an allegory here somewhere.  I\\'m reaching for it.  Something about Fred and Dave\\'s reckless abandon, coupled with precision and technique.  A hockey metaphor, perhaps. The hell with it.  Look, sausages.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Montreal to Quebec City by rail.  160 miles of wintry vistas, whip past the windows, evocative for some of another time.\\n\\nMORIN:  The Canadian caviar, Sturgeon Canadian caviar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not sure about Dave McMillan, but in Fred Morin\\'s perfect world, we would all travel by rail.  It would still be the golden age of rail travel.\\n\\n(On camera): So tell me about the great Canadian rail system.\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s purely emotional.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  MORIN:  There\\'s nothing rational about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Fred is what one might call conservatively an aficionado.\\n\\n(On camera):  So how extreme is your railroad nerdism?\\n\\nMORIN:  This is how bad it gets.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  You have other operating manuals?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of this model train.\\n\\nMORIN:  Yes.  The model.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you have other operating manuals?\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Books, printed ephemera, collectibles.  Fred retains an enduring love for the great iron horses that still take passengers across the frozen land he calls home.  But it\\'s something more than just nostalgia.  It\\'s also an appreciation for a dying art.\\n\\nMORIN:  It\\'s like the old cruise ships.  You transport your comfort, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For those halcyon days of cross-country rail, there were lavish dining cars, luxurious sleeping compartments, a bar car with liveried attendants.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Look at the menus, how people used to eat on the trains. It\\'s also an inspiration on how we cook in the restaurant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Casserole and sweet breads and fresh peas with Veronese sauce.  Leg of lamb (INAUDIBLE) jelly.\\n\\nMORIN:  Some very nice pictures in the dining by train book, with the guy holding the turkey and cutting the turkey.  And you order a drink, it comes from a bottle made out of glass, into a glass made out of glass.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nMORIN:  Which is kind of cool in our day and age.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It goes back to service, doesn\\'t it?  Thank you.\\n\\n(Voice-over): We are presented with a perfectly serviceable omelet. There may no longer be a smoking lounge with brass pitons, but this does not mean a traveler has to suffer.\\n\\n(On camera):  So you always travel with a truffle shaver?\\n\\nMORIN:  During truffle season.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As a gentleman must.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  I\\'ve got to get a inaction photograph.  Hold on.  Canadian rail.  People are going to be expecting, wait a minute, where is my fist-sized truffle?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Can I get the truffle option, please?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, of course.  Don\\'t forget the foie.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Quebec City, one of the oldest European settlements in North America.  Samuel de Champlain, known as the father of New France, sailed up the St. Lawrence and founded the site in 1608.  When the fighting started with you know who, Quebec City was the French stronghold until the bitter end when the French fell at the plains of Abraham.\\n\\nThe French may have lost that one, but some things French have stayed firm, unbowed, resiliently unchanged by trends or history.\\n\\nThe Continental is the kind of place about which I am unreservedly sentimental.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  When I was younger, I ate here with my grandparents and my parents, yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, that\\'s older restaurant in town.  It\\'s open since 1956.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Classic, unironic, cuisine (INAUDIBLE), meaning dishes you haven\\'t seen since like forever.  A hipster-free zone of French, continental, ocean liner classics such as Caesar salad, tossed fresh to (INAUDIBLE) tableside and beef tartare, also prepared tableside as one must.\\n\\nShrimp cocktail, not a deconstructed shrimp cocktail mind you, a shrimp cocktail, the way Jesus wants you to eat them.  All served by a dedicated professional.\\n\\n(On camera):  In culinary school we were taught this.  I mean, real customers as your final class.  We had to do the (INAUDIBLE) of fruits, tableside, all of that, which inevitably would fly off the fork or land (INAUDIBLE) soup.  I was so bad at it.  I would run into trouble and I would be like, I\\'ll be right back, behind the scene.  I bite with my teeth.  Stripping the thing.  At least once a day one of the students would set themselves or the customers on fire.\\n\\nThe bather would, like, spill, and they\\'d light, there\\'d be this line from, like, the thing down up across the floor up their leg.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  No, that shit doesn\\'t happen here.  Like I said, professionals.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is going to go like a big fireball.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Fireball.  Good.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  The kind who know how to properly prepare these dishes.\\n\\n(On camera):  Sweet.\\n\\nMORIN:  Like a goose bump moment.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  For Dave, another classic, filet de boeuf en (INAUDIBLE).  A filet mignon, a sauce made of cognac, cream and glass (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(On camera):  That is nice.  Look at that.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And for Fred, scampi Newburgh.  When is the last time you saw the word \"Newburgh\" on a menu?\\n\\n(On camera):  Awesome, absolutely awesome.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  But for me, that most noble of dishes, Dover sole. This appears to be one of the few remaining servers alive who knows how to take that fish off the bone, sauce it, and properly serve it.\\n\\n(On camera):  Thank you very much.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bon appetit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Merci.  Man, I love this place.  I\\'m so happy.  It\\'s very comfortable.  There\\'s continuity in this world.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Across town, another thing entirely.  The younger, wilder L\\'affaire est Ketchup, which I\\'m reliably informed means everything is cool in local idiom.\\n\\nAt this point in my life, I just don\\'t know anymore.  Are these young cooks, these servers, these dedicated entrepreneurs, are these hipsters?  Or am I just a cranky old who think anybody below the age of 30 is a hipster?  I don\\'t know, but I admire them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So how much did it cost you when you opened?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look at this tiny electric four-burner stove.  At no point in my cooking career could I have worked with one of these without murdering everyone in the vicinity before hanging myself from the nearest beam.\\n\\n(On camera):  How long did it take to adapt?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say like three months.  At the beginning, I was lucky that I didn\\'t have, like, a lot of customers.  It was like, oh, man.  I was freaking out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  And yet these kids today, look at them go, serving a wildly ambitious and quite substantial ever-changing menu out of this -- this Suzy homemaker oven.  Tonight there\\'s razor clams with burned (INAUDIBLE), and a cream of haddock roe.\\n\\n(On camera):  Very cool.  Thank you.  I love razor clams.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And coquille St. Jacques.  You\\'ll notice that nobody in Quebec seems to skimp on the portions.  A (INAUDIBLE) of foie gras, head cheese with (INAUDIBLE) mustard, and Ris de veau truffe, that\\'s truffled sweetbreads, and you got some goose hearts (INAUDIBLE) for good measure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now the goose heart is excellent.  Goose heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Hearts in general.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Also you got your morue salee with grilled tomato bread.  That\\'s salt cod for you, Anglos.\\n\\nI\\'m all swollen up, like the (INAUDIBLE), and ready to burst in a livery omni-directional mist.  Hotel motel time for me.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  How Canadian is Quebec?  Are they truly one entity or two?  This is a question that has been wrestled with for some time.  Quebec is certainly part of Canada, but in many ways both culturally, spiritually and linguistically, it\\'s very much another thing entirely.  There\\'s a lot of history, much of it contentious.  Go back far enough and you get a clearer picture of why.\\n\\nThe French arrived on the shores of Quebec City in the early 16th century that succumbed to the military might of Great Britain in the mid-18th.  Thus began a gradual but steady persecution of all things French.  The Quebecois had struggled mightily to hang on to their French heritage and language.  The issue of seceding entirely a notion that persists to some extent even today.\\n\\nJournalist Patrick Lagace meets me at Bistro M Sur Masson to help me understand a little bit of what many Quebecois feel is at stake.\\n\\n(On camera):  So I was going to talk about the whole history of French Quebecois identify.  A separatist movement, but I have to get right to the pressing matter of the day, pasta-gate.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nPATRICK LAGACE, JOURNALIST:  Pasta- gate.  What do you want to know about pasta-gate?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  For those not up on current Quebec politics, pasta-gate refers to an incident where local authorities notified an Italian restaurant that they were in violation of French laws because they used the word \"pasta\" which is Italian.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is --\\n\\nLAGACE:  OK.  Stop apologizing, OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Don\\'t get me wrong.  My last name is Bourdain. I lean French.  Hard.  (On camera):  I am enormously sympathetic to the language laws.\\n\\nLAGACE:  You don\\'t think it\\'s preposterous?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I do not think it\\'s preposterous.  But here we have a situation.\\n\\nLAGACE:  It is stupid.  I agree with you completely that this province 40 years ago was in some respects an English city, so we needed to have language laws for signage and stuff.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Now signage, for instance, must by law be principally in French.  French first in all things.\\n\\nLAGACE:  But ever bureaucracy produces byproducts of stupidity, and that was it.  And you know what?  It will not stand.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Anglo Canadians treated French-speaking Quebecois like second-class crap for much of history.  So I get it.  I\\'d be pissed, too.  I want my own thing and when I got it, I\\'d wake to make sure there\\'s no backsliding to the bad old days.\\n\\nLAGACE:  When the (INAUDIBLE) Quebecois, the first sovereignist party to be elected, it was in 1976, it didn\\'t come out of a vacuum.  It came out from a couple of decades of awakening and struggle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Fifty years from now, will people still speak in --\\n\\nLAGACE:  French.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  -- predominantly French in Montreal?\\n\\nLAGACE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No doubt about it.\\n\\nLAGACE:  No doubt about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  French first is something most would agree with.  How far and how rigorously you want to go with that?  Well --\\n\\n(On camera):  Do you think there was ever any possibility or real majority or plurality of Quebecois who would have voted in separate nation status?\\n\\nLAGACE:  You know, in English, you guys say timing is everything.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nLAGACE:  And timing was never better than in the period 1990, \\'91, \\'92, because in \\'95 this country came inches from being broken up.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Close.  Yes.  And do you think it will ever happen in the history of the world?\\n\\nLAGACE:  I don\\'t know, but I know one thing.  Anybody who says separatism is dead in this country and this province is a fool.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  No matter how you feel about Quebec as either separate from or as an essentially part of greater Canada, any reasonable person loves this place.\\n\\n(On camera):  Correct me if I\\'m wrong, Wilensky\\'s is famous for the sandwich?  The special.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wilensky special.  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And it was tradition does this fall?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It\\'s basically Eastern Europe.  It was a survival thing.  It was because they were poor.  And that\\'s what they could make.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Wilensky\\'s, an old-school corner institution around since 1932, serving up pressed beef baloney and salami sandwiches, or specials as they call them, along with egg creams and milkshakes.\\n\\n(On camera):  So the special and an appropriate beverage and egg cream?  Very happy.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Here\\'s how it goes.  There are rules.  The special is always served with mustard.  It is never cut in two.  Don\\'t ask why, just because.  That\\'s the way it\\'s always been done.  A little respect for tradition, please.\\n\\n(On camera):  I\\'m happy now.  You know?  Some things are beloved institutions for a reason.  This is delicious.  Thank you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The tradition of the cabane a sucre or sugar shack is as old as maple syrup here in Quebec, where 70 percent of the world\\'s supply comes from.  Deeply embedded in the maple syrup outdoor lumberjack lifestyle is the cabin in the woods, where maple sap is collected and boiled down to syrup.\\n\\nOver time, many of these cabins became informal eating houses, dining halls for workers and a few guests, where a lucky few could sit at communal tables and enjoy the bounty of the trees and forests around them.\\n\\nMartin Picard has taken this tradition to what is somehow both its logical conclusion and insane extreme, creating his own cabane a sucre open only during maple season and serving food stemming directly from those humble yet hearty roots.  It makes perfect sense in one way, I mean, 130 acres produce about 32,000 gallons of maple sap, which run through these tubes to here where they\\'re cooked down to about 800 gallons of syrup, which is more or less what they use per season here.\\n\\nNothing leaves the proper.  And it makes sense, while you\\'re here to raise hogs, and cattle on the property.  And maybe keep a cabin or two around for any friends who get too loaded to sleep it off.  But this? This?  Is there really any reason for this?\\n\\n(On camera):  What are you doing here?  Why do you have to make life so hard?  If money were your primary motivation --\\n\\nPICARD:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This doesn\\'t seem like the fasters road to untold wealth.\\n\\nPICARD:  My grandfather, you know, had a sugar shack.  Everybody had a -- you can go back, you know, three generations, they had a sugar shack.  And I\\'m very proud of Quebec.  I\\'m very proud of Canada, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You celebrate Canadian history, you celebrate Canadian traditions, you celebrate Canadian ingredients in a way that no one else has.  Are you some kind of patriot?  Is that what\\'s going on here?  Is it national Quebecois fervor?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  That\\'s very much it.  He\\'s very much a patriot.  I say it all the time, it\\'s one of the most important restaurants to me, in North America if not the world.  It\\'s an art installation if you actually -- if you look at it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  The meal begins -- begins with a tower of maple desserts.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good lord.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Sponge maple toffee, maple doughnuts, beaver tails, maple cotton candy, but wait, there\\'s more.  Almond croissants, whip- it biscuits, some nougat.\\n\\n(On camera):  There we go.  I think that\\'s a first for me.  I\\'ve never seen that done.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  No?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not with a hammer.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Let the madness begin.  Next, a whole lobe of foie gras with baked beans on a pancake cooked in duck fat, of course, cottage cheese and eggs cooked in maple syrup.\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow, that\\'s awesome.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  There\\'s a healthy salad, sauteed duck hearts, gizzards, and pig\\'s ear, topped with a heaping pile of fried pork rines.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good lord.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And a calf brain and maple bacon omelet.  And these.\\n\\n(On camera):  How is this made?\\n\\nPICARD:  With love.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  With love.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  Panko (ph) encrusted duck drumsticks with shrimp and salmon mouse and maple barbecue sauce.\\n\\n(On camera):  Good lord.  Wow.\\n\\nPICARD:  So this is a classic Quebecer dish, it\\'s called la tourtiere, you know, a meat pie.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Tourtiere de Shack, a whole lot of cheese, foie gras, calf brain, sweetbreads, bacon and arugula, but with Martin, that\\'s not sufficient.\\n\\nPICARD:  Usually there\\'s no truffle, but I just.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, black truffles.\\n\\n(On camera):  More truffle.\\n\\nPICARD:  There\\'s going to be too much truffle.\\n\\nMORIN:  My blood is getting thicker as I look that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And now the main course, a homegrown smoked right out front local ham with pineapple and green beans almondine.  And chicken, but with Martin the chicken is never just chicken.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s (INAUDIBLE), with foie gras and lobster.  We pump lobster bisque in the chicken.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  In the chicken.\\n\\nPICARD:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good god.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  There is a light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\n(On camera):  Someone should be singing the national anthem now, I mean really.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And practically prehistoric old school Canadian classic.  Maple syrup is heated, then poured on snow, becoming a kind of taffy, but the preferred delivery mechanism does present some issues.\\n\\nPICARD:  No, no, no, no.  Take a big one, and you have to suck it. Don\\'t swallow it, you know.  Look, you have to go like that, slowly, slowly, no?  Slowly, slowly.  That\\'s how it\\'s good.  That\\'s it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  Got to do that in a manly way?  You just don\\'t look down.  You sort of look away, a distracted way.  It\\'s like I\\'m not really (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  The best way is to look up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Finally there\\'s maple meringue cake and maple ice cream with chocolate shards.\\n\\n(On camera):  Any suggestion on how to attack this?\\n\\nMORIN:  We did it once.  I won the check (INAUDIBLE) for the ice cream cone.  Chefs suggest that eat the ice cream like that.\\n\\nPICARD:  That\\'s the thing.  I think there\\'s too much focusing on the food.  You know?  Like, wow, this is very intellectual and I wow, and then blah, blah, and have done too much all those shit, you know?  I don\\'t want to do that.  I don\\'t want to play game anymore.\\n\\nMORIN:  Because food is feces in waiting.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (on camera):  This is CNN.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  If there\\'s one thing you always need on a cold snowy night, it\\'s yet another hearty meal.  I meet back up with Fred and Dave in Liverpool House, the sister restaurant to Joe Beef.\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  I think we always compensate a little bit with overabundance of food because of our insecurity of not being like good cooks.\\n\\nMORIN:  You know, you know what, it\\'s a combination of low self-esteem and generosity that explains the amount of food perhaps.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  First course.  Look at that.  Unbelievable.  Look at the aspic work.\\n\\nMORIN:  This is smoked veal and potatoes inside.  Salmon pastrami.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But wait a minute, this is super classic.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  And this.  Egg and aspic, soft boiled or poached egg in clear gelatin set broth classically garnished with white ham, tarragon leaves and black truffles.\\n\\n(On camera):  Oh, my gosh.  I was pretty sure that I would live the rest of my life without ever seeing this again.  Delicious.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  But tonight after a full week of Franco-Canadian full on assaults on our livers and our lights, Fred and Dave\\'s sauce would be both delicious and merciful to take advantage of the somewhat lighter and insanely delicious fare by their brilliant chef Omar, who\\'s from Pakistan.  Amazing authentic Pakistani food.\\n\\n(On camera):  So what do we have here?  MORIN:  Butter chicken crab, octopus (INAUDIBLE), little eggplant grazed with (INAUDIBLE), pomegranate, a little mushrooms, rabbit (INAUDIBLE), fingerlings with (INAUDIBLE) fennel.  This is donkey in a hurry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN (voice-over):  Yes.  He did say donkey meat.  Is there something wrong with that?  The dishes continue, a Pakistani gumbo with okra and coriander, and sesame seed and green pepper curry, hanger state (INAUDIBLE).  All beef scotched egg, a pouri (ph) with horse meat tartar and an authentic goat (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n(On camera):  Wow.\\n\\nMORIN:  Are you full?\\n\\nMCMILLAN:  Yes.  Food for 12.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We did good work here.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  In the end, but perhaps as a nod to the Anglo tradition however there will be stilt.\\n\\n(On camera):  This is a genius meal.\\n\\n(Voice-over):  These princes of gastronomy never a suboptimal moment, nothing short of excellent accepted.  Beyond excellent.  Too much excellent, yes, possibly.  Over the top?  Yes, definitely.\\n\\nIt all comes around in the end, the circle of life.  We begin at the beginning.  The heart and soul of every right-thinking Quebecois apparently.\\n\\nIce, a stick and a puck.  Fred and Dave and Martin Picard are joined by the original god of Montreal gastronomy, the great chef, Normand Laprise, to watch their beloved Montreal Canadians lay waste to the Carolina Hurricanes.

      "{'colognegermany': '\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:00:16] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through translator) The Ground Rules of Kolsch.  It is what it is.  It\\'ll come as it comes.  It\\'s always gone well.  What\\'s gone is gone.  Nothing stays as it was.  Don\\'t know it, don\\'t need it, chuck it.  What\\'re you going to do?  Do it right, but not too often.  What\\'s with that?  You drinking\\' one with us?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  They say, and by \"they,\" I mean people from around here, that Cologne is an ugly city.  This is quickly followed by the proud statement that the people are nice.  That they are welcoming, tolerant, kind, open to new things.  I never saw Cologne as ugly at all.  I always saw it as, well, charming in the least patronizing sense of the word.  I mean, this city charms you. It takes you in.  It makes you feel welcome.\\n\\nMaybe it was the non-douchey beer culture here that appealed.  I don\\'t mean beer culture in a judgmental neck beard hovering over you waiting for you to decide between craft beers way either.  I mean, but here decent beer is a way of life.  It\\'s a birthright.  You don\\'t talk about it too much.  You freakin\\' drink it.  Beer here means more often than not, Kolsch.  Heinz Grune has lived in Cologne his whole life.\\n\\nHEINZ GRUNE, COLOGNE RESIDENT:  Cheers.  Prost.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Prost.  He does marketing for several German breweries, so Kolsch is an integral part of both his social and business lives. Kolsch is not a brand.  What is this anyway?\\n\\nGRUNE:  Let\\'s call it a style.  It\\'s a pale ale and people loves to drink it in high amounts.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Malzmuhle Brewery has been slinging beer non-stop for the last 150 years.  Democratic, utilitarian, welcoming to all people with a powerful thirst.  I love the whole style, the little glasses.  Is this unique to Cologne?\\n\\nGRUNE:  Other regions of Germany, you won\\'t find such small glass.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGRUNE:  They start with \\'03 to \\'05. BOURDAIN:  To the giant.\\n\\nGRUNE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know, if you have a giant thing of beer, it\\'s like piss warm by the time you get down to the bottom.\\n\\nGRUNE:  Right.  But here it\\'s necessary because it is not very carbonated and the foam disappears in minutes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nGRUNE:  There are guys who drink it in one sip.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m not sure the exact blood absorption rate of alcohol but I would think that if you\\'re hammering these things back, it\\'s hitting your bloodstream at the perfect rate.\\n\\nGRUNE:  Maybe we he to name them alcoholic but they are accustomed to it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There are certain iconic accompaniments to beer drinking when in Cologne.  Like Mettbroetchen which is minced raw pork with onions on a roll.  Or Halve Hahn, which is simply gouda cheese on rye. This is really good.\\n\\nGRUNE:  By now you see how it goes, no?  You\\'ll get the Kolsch without ordering.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t like this custom, though.  I don\\'t want to know how many beers I\\'ve had.  This is ...\\n\\nGRUNE:  OK, but he has to know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, that\\'s fine.  Can\\'t he do his own little system somewhere around here?  I\\'m thinking, \"Geez, I\\'ve got a problem.\" It\\'s when the Himmel und Erde or Heaven and Earth hits the table that I start getting deep into my happy zone.  That\\'s blood sausage, fried onions, and mashed potatoes with applesauce which if you don\\'t like, by the way, pretty much removes you from my \"will save from drowning\" list.  And then, there\\'s this.  The dish that almost alone brought me back to Cologne.  It was sweet, sweet memories of this stegosaurus sized shank of cured pork boiled and boiled until it literally falls away from the bone steaming and moist, a symphony of meat and gelatin and good, good stuff.  God is hiding in there somewhere.\\n\\n[21:05:10] GRUNE:  Cologne is a workers\\' town, you know?  So the kitchen is definitely a workers\\' kitchen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And yet, it has a pretty liberal progressive world view. Where did that come from?\\n\\nGRUNE:  It has something to do with the river.  Occupation here was trading, so the Cologne people from the beginning were interested in other people and they took profit of other people.  We are not afraid of influences from outside.  But therefore, it\\'s also important to have some traditions that are lasting for a long time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And one of those would be Kolsch.\\n\\nGRUNE:  One of is Kolsch, one of it\\'s a dish and people know that they can come here, and it won\\'t change.  This place will not change in the next 200 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cologne is or was a predominately Catholic city, perhaps more Mediterranean in temperament than those fun-hating Lutherans and Calvinists.  It\\'s Germany\\'s fun-zone and from November to February Cologners celebrates Carnival.  Partying here has a whole season.\\n\\nCarnival here is an exuberant, anarchistic, bat-shit wild, 40-day celebration leading up to Lent.  It can be absolute mayhem.  My completely rational fear of clowns, mimes, parades, public dancing and crowds in general really, prohibits me from taking part.\\n\\nThese days Brian Jones could come back from the grave for one night only with the Stones and Janis and Jimmy and Jim, they could all be there.  And you know what?  I ain\\'t going.  But the Cologners, God bless them.  They love it.\\n\\nBei Oma Kleinmann handles enormous crowds of revelers.  Fortunately, the madness is still a few weeks away.  And this is my old friend Tracey (ph) who had the good or bad fortune, depending on how you look at it, to travel and produce shows around the world with me for many years.  Anke (ph) is from Cologne and makes me feel better about my Carnival phobia.  Carnival, do you like Carnival?\\n\\nTRACEY, ANTHONY BOURDAIN\\'S FRIEND:  I do, and I\\'m not ashamed to say it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Will jesters and bards and medievally attired pranksters be popping up during my stay here?\\n\\nTRACEY:  You\\'re missing out.  You\\'re really are ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mimes?  No mimes, troubadours, jugglers, uh, human statues?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Come on.\\n\\nANKE, COLOGNE RESIDENT:  All of them are wearing bonkers costumes and look like shit.  I don\\'t like it.  No, I always get embarrassed about those people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate Carnival.\\n\\nANKE:  I hate Carnival too.\\n\\nTRACEY:  You ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there parades?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Yes.\\n\\nANKE:  Yes. BOURDAIN:  I hate parades.\\n\\nTRACEY:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there clowns?\\n\\nTRACEY:  You hate clowns.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate clowns.\\n\\nTRACEY:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jesters?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Yeah, occasionally.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Festive attire?  I have beer right now.  I don\\'t need no stinking Carnival to drink beer, man.  And as I understand it, I am urged to drink beer as part of a community of beer drinkers with other bros.  I hate bros.\\n\\nTRACEY:  It\\'s not just bros.  It\\'s a whole community of people speaking in dialect, singing songs in dialect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Singing, I forgot to mention that.\\n\\nTRACEY:  Singing is good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I hate that too.\\n\\nTRACEY:  There is another side and if you open your heart you would see it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  My heart is a cold, cold place, and there\\'s no room in it for jugglers.  What did you think when you heard that I want to come to Germany and go to Cologne?\\n\\nTRACEY:  That\\'s awesome because Cologne is like the other city in Germany that I can really identify with.  It\\'s like I have this love affair with it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I often say that the places I go, there\\'s a pheromonic (ph) decision made very quickly.  You step outside the airport terminal, and then you go, may you know right away.  There\\'s something about this place that\\'s -- that I think I\\'m going to like.\"\\n\\nANKE:  A few weeks ago a friend of mine from Berlin came to visit me, and after three days he just looked at me and said, \"Anke, what is this?  Why are you all so satisfied?  Why are you all so happy?  Why are you all so relaxed?\"  I don\\'t know, maybe it is because everybody\\'s telling us that our city is ugly and Berlin is the big thing.  Maybe we have to show with our hearts that we are good people and we -- that we are having fun and I think the Kolsch is helping.\\n\\n[21:10:09] TRACEY:  For some reason every time I arrive here, I always feel like somehow the people are more open here to me being American and speaking German.  And part of it is this Carnival thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?\\n\\nTRACEY:  Maybe it\\'s my own self-discovery of like being in another place and finally being accepted, maybe because I\\'m in costume and they don\\'t know right away that I\\'m not German.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, it\\'s sort of like an \"Eyes Wide Shut\" kind of a thing.\\n\\nTRACEY:  I know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is what I came here for, though.  Surfboard-sized slabs of veal and pork filled with many wonderful things, dredged in bread crumbs and fried in magical, magical deep fat.  Now that\\'s a Carnival I can get behind.  Wow.\\n\\nTRACEY:  That looks amazing.\\n\\nANKE:  Wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That is unbelievable.\\n\\nTRACEY:  Supposedly, you can split your schnitzel in half, take the other half home and it\\'s really good for breakfast.\\n\\nANKE:  Yeah.\\n\\nTRACEY:  It\\'s like the German equivalent of pizza in the morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  Well, there\\'s a tradition I totally support. Considering it\\'s a weird drinking culture, at the end of the night, will there be two or three or five or ten people all hang out like way past the point that they should have gone home?  Or does everybody reach a sensible point of intoxication or say, \"Well you know what? I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\"?  I mean, they\\'re forcing beers on us.  I didn\\'t order a beer and another one just keeps coming.\\n\\nTRACEY:  Do you know how to make it stop?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Face plant it to my schnitzel?\\n\\nTRACEY:  There\\'s an easier way.  You do this.  That means, like, \"I\\'m done.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, but nobody\\'s doing that.\\n\\nANKE:  Not yet.\\n\\nTRACEY:  I\\'m not doing that.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:15:24] BOURDAIN:  So, let\\'s talk about the elephant in the room. We know that Cologne is a proudly tolerant, fun-loving, beer drinking, pork-happy and friendly little city.  But just a few days before we arrived, Cologne became the focus of the whole argument over Europe\\'s refugee crisis.\\n\\nCologne of all places is now the example for both sides of an increasingly bitter argument over whether Europe and by the extension the world should turn their backs on the millions of refugees spilling out of Syria, Iraq, and a Middle East spinning into chaos and slaughter.  With the bodies of children washing up on Greek beaches and few other countries willing to help, Germany has taken in 1.1 million people fleeing ISIS, Russian and Syrian bombs and war.  One should, I believe, be admired and even celebrated for doing the morally right thing over the probably wise thing.\\n\\nSakher Al Mohamad is one of many who found his way to Cologne.  Hani Zaitoun helps refugees as they try to integrate into German society. This is unsurprisingly easier said than done.  Getting to Turkey, no problem?\\n\\nSAKHER AL MOHAMAD, REFUGEE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Turkey to Greece, problems.\\n\\nHANI ZAITOUN:  Getting to Turkey is now a problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  But in that time, it was not a problem.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Next, went from Greece to Macedonia?  Yes, correct? Welcome there?\\n\\nAL MOHAMAD:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Serbia?\\n\\nAL MOHAMAD:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Were you welcomed here?\\n\\nAL MOHAMAD:  Yes.  Very welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So here we are, Cologne, one of the most liberal, if not the most liberal cities in Germany.  A city doing the right thing. And on New Year\\'s Eve, the whole attitude towards refugees, not just European policy, but the whole moral question was thrown into doubt.\\n\\nCologne found itself the test case, both the example of tolerance and hope and worst-case scenario.  Here\\'s what was reported.  On the night of December 31, 2015, witnesses saw crowds of up to a thousand men described as predominately Arab and North African near Cologne Central Train Station.  Some broke off into small groups, assaulting hundreds of women as they left the train station.  Police were completely unprepared.  The situation continued reportedly for hours.\\n\\nThree weeks after the incident, the official numbers were as horrifying as first reported.  766 criminal complaints, of which 381 are sexual offenses, including 3 rapes.  Many across the world of course saw this as the perfect \"I told you so\" moment.  A sadly understandable reaction.  There is no minimizing 381 sexual offenses in one night.\\n\\nHow big an effect is this going to have on the situation?\\n\\nZAITOUN:  So all Syrians that I knew were totally condemning what happened and we absolutely cannot tolerate something like this because it\\'s not a part of my culture, it\\'s not a part of ...\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But do you think it will change the political climate is what I\\'m asking.  Before it was relatively easy for a German politician to say, \"Look, have a heart here.  Let\\'s do the right and moral thing.\" And it is being used as a club to beat any politician or leader who would like to have a more conciliatory or more welcoming attitude towards people who clearly need help.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  Refugees are human beings.  And some of them are good and some of them are bad.  There is 500 refugees who did this and they\\'re pretty bad.  It\\'s the fault of those who did it but it\\'s not the fault of the refugees.  It\\'s not the fault of the Germans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The infrastructure exists more or less to ...\\n\\nZAITOUN:  Exists.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  ... handle this enormous influx.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  An integration of 200,000 to 300,000 would be easier than integration of 1.1 million that entered in 2015.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  This is a challenge not only for the Germans but also for those who came to integrate in the community.  It\\'s something that has to be worked -- work on from both sides, not only the Syrians, but also the Germans.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nZAITOUN:  The Germans are willing to because that they\\'re pretty well organized.\\n\\n[21:20:17] BOURDAIN:  Germany and Cologne had reason to believe they could pull this off.  Absorb all those refugees from a culture very different than their own.  Here in Cologne, the Turkish presence is larger than any other in the country.  F\\n\\nAs I understand that during the \\'60s, \\'70s, the German industry essentially recruited in cooperation with the Turkish government, huge numbers of Turkish workers.  Was that the beginning of the size able Turkish population?\\n\\nMELEK YAPRAK, TURKISH IMMIGRANT:  Yes.  It was.  Like my grandfather and my grandmother, they came here in the \\'70s.  My parents, they started to work in a company like in the, a rural company.  Everybody has almost the same story in this good generation.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Melek Yaprak\\'s (ph) grandparents were among the first wave of Turks to arrive in Cologne.  And to a great extent nowadays, Turkish food is German food, the way Italian, Eastern European, Jewish, and Chinese have become American food.  Raki to start.  Prost.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Prost.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That brings me back.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah?  This brings back Istanbul to us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  When we go there, we have always Raki and the Bosphorus and here, this is like Istanbul feeling for us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, me too.  And meze.  Spicy mashed vegetables, tzatziki, hummus, beetroot and olive dip, fried eggplant, pastries with feta, meatballs with tomato sauce and mint.  Wow.  That looks really pretty.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I don\\'t think that you have any problems with spice?  Yeah?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No, no, no.  I don\\'t.  Very much.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Not at all.  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Since you are born here, how Turkish do you feel?  And how German do you feel?  And when does that equation change?  Are there times when you feel like, \"I\\'m not part of this,\" or other times you feel, \"Oh, I am definitely part of this.\"\\n\\nYAPRAK:  That\\'s a question -- I\\'m thinking about all my life.  In my heart, I\\'m Turkish.  In my head, I\\'m German.  I\\'m glad that my parents wanted to have a good education for me.  But still at home, they were Turkish, like Turkish traditions and for the Turkish thinking, so I was always on both sides.  And now, I\\'m adult enough to pick the best ones from both sides.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Growing up here as the child of Turkish immigrants, how did you feel in school?  You felt German?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah.  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, why do you think Germany\\'s good at that?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  The Germans are very correct people.  They want to have everything on the point.  They don\\'t like surprises.  So they organize everything before.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s almost a cliche that it\\'s organized.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  It\\'s not a cliche, it\\'s organized.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Grilled minced lamb basted with hot tomato sauce and slathered with melted sheep butter and yogurt.  Roast lamb with feta, bulgur, and roasted vegetables.  That\\'s beautiful.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Danke schon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So if you graduate from University here and choose to live in Cologne, could you afford to live here?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah.  You can.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s reasonably affordable.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yeah.  But because of the refugee situation I think living space is becoming less, like everywhere.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think this is a pretty town?  Every -- most of the people I speak to say, \"Well, you know, we\\'re a very ugly city.\"\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But I don\\'t think so.  I think it\\'s very pretty.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  Everything was destroyed after the Second World War.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah, but it\\'s not the most beautiful city in the world but it is not an ugly city, I mean, at all.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I think I\\'m more with the ugly city.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You think it\\'s ugly?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  The buildings are new, ugly, gray, like made up after the Second World War.  There\\'s only small, old town.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I miss the old buildings like in Munich.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So 20 years from now, will Cologne be the same?\\n\\nYAPRAK:  I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t want to think about it because now it\\'s fine.  I love it as it is now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I don\\'t hear that a lot.  You know, you go to San Francisco, Rio, there are pressing problems or that the character of the city is changing.  The character of this city does not seem to be changing.\\n\\nYAPRAK:  No.  It stays as it is.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:28:00] BOURDAIN:  If there\\'s one musical movement or one band that represents Cologne better than this one, I don\\'t know what it could be.  Created in 1964, with Holger Czukay, Jaki Liebzeit, Michael Karoli, and this man, Irmin Schmidt, Can was at the forefront of what was called inevitably the Krautrock Movement.  Combing the sounds and attitudes of classical, avant-garde, rock and funk.\\n\\nSo, so you moved here -- how old were you when you ... IRMIN, KARL HEINZ STOCKHAUSEN\\'S COLLEAGUE:  I\\'m here in \\'64.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Interesting time, \\'64.\\n\\nIRMIN:  It was a very interesting time.  It was the time of -- where Cologne was really blossoming.  It was the art town in Germany.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Irmin (ph) studied with Karl Heinz Stockhausen (ph), but it was a trip to New York City where he was exposed to what new read and similarly classically trained John Cale were doing with the Velvet Underground that would prove to be the catalyst for Can.\\n\\n\\'64 was still pretty early days for cultural ferment, I guess maybe.\\n\\nIRMIN:  But not here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not here.\\n\\nIRMIN:  Not here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, so the question is, why here?  What was it about Cologne?\\n\\nIRMIN:  Well, I think it\\'s this generation which were like me.  We grew up in this after war, terrible destruction.  And that was the generation which started to create something new.  That was bubbling from everywhere.\\n\\n', 'senegal': '\\n[21:00:17] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\":  Some places surprise you.  Even if you\\'ve been traveling nearly non-stop for 15 years like me, there are places that snap you out of your comfortable world view, take your assumptions and your prejudices, and turn them upside down.  They lead you to believe that maybe there is hope in the world.  Senegal is one of those places.\\n\\n(SHA-LA-LA-ING PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  At first you see what you see in so many places in Africa -- the noisy streets, busy markets, the controlled, consensual chaos of daily commerce.  But look just a little bit longer, a little bit deeper, and you\\'ll see it\\'s so different here from its neighbors -- from anywhere, really.  A rebuke to those who\\'d paint a whole continent as a monolith of despair, or Islam as something to be feared.  Senegal turns simple minded assumptions and prejudice on their heads at every turn.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did you come to know and like and love this country?\\n\\nOFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, NPR AFRICA CORRESPONDENT:  I think it was just listening and watching and thinking, \"Gosh, this is quite different to all the other countries I know.\"  For a start, the languages.  You\\'ve heard Wolof?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  (SPEAKS WOLOF) Sometimes you think people were quarrelling.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  And they\\'re not, they\\'re laughing.  They\\'re laughing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is the NPR Africa correspondent. She\\'s of Ghanaian descent, but has made Dakar the Senegalese capital, her home for over ten years.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON: The Senegalese are easy to get on with and they care about you and I guess that\\'s what we all want as human beings, isn\\'t it?  To be loved, to be cherished.  And, I found that here.  I won\\'t be here forever because I\\'m from Ghana, but I will be visiting forever because there are no two Senegals.  I mean (SPEAKING FRENCH).  I think the Senegalese are extraordinary, they\\'re open, they welcome you, and, for me, that about makes a good place to live.  BOURDAIN:  I fear I come with this assumption that Senegal will be yet\\n\\nanother failed state or yet another state that, that has gone through, uh, a really terrible post-colonial period that never really --that, that transitioned badly.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  You\\'ll know that Senegal is one of the few countries, never had a coup d\\'etat.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  And I think that that just makes such a huge difference to a nation.  We\\'re in a ninety-plus percent Muslim country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nQUIST-ARCTON:  Their first president, a Catholic who governed for 20 years.  And, of course, there, there were elements of repression but not as we\\'ve seen in many other African countries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Europeans first reached West Africa in the mid-15th Century bringing with them the usual things -- an  industrialized slave trade, subjugation, the rule of the many by the very few.  In the carving up of a continent it was France that got Senegal and commanding favorite status within France\\'s West African Colonial holdings, the Senegalese gained full rights as French citizens in the late 1800\\'s.  With independence in 1960, power passed bloodlessly and with stunning cordiality.  Though overwhelmingly a Muslim country, Senegal elected Leopold Senghor, a Catholic as their first president and, from that time on, Senegal has enjoyed a moderate political and religious climate unique almost anywhere in the world.\\n\\n[21:05:20] PIERRE THIAM, PIERRE THIAM CATERING OWNER:  Well, food is great when cultures meet, you know?  Because the colonial power brought their food culture.  I think that\\'s what makes great food and, uh, Senegal is great for that because of its geographical location. It\\'s a cross road.  I think that\\'s what makes the food quite unique here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Pierre Thiam is a chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author who was born and raised here in Dakar.  His books are absolutely fundamental references when investigating Senegalese cuisine.\\n\\nTHIAM:  This is Senegalese favorite fish.  It is called Thiof.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It kind of tastes like grouper.  So, I think we should have it.  Great fish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nSenegal has famously delicious food -- flavors, and, often, ingredients that should be eerily familiar to any fan of Southern cooking.  We meet at Cour De Cassation Beach serving food just the way I like it -- a shack on the water, catch of the day, cooked up out back.  THIAM:  This whole thing is illegal, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s, it\\'s -- they don\\'t have a license.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But, I mean, they\\'re continuously operating.  I mean it technically --\\n\\nTHIAM:  But, every once in a while -- once in a while, I come and it\\'s closed.  The police shuts them down.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.  But then they come back.\\n\\nTHIAM:  And then they come back.  You know?  It\\'s --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh!  These are supposed to be good, right?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is local beer.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s the local beer.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s the finest of the local beer.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Well, it\\'s considered the people\\'s beer.  It\\'s the cheapest one.  Yes, so --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, well, huh, it figures.  I\\'m a cheap date.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nDo you want to hide these, uh?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Actually the, yes.  Just put it under the table, actually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know what I\\'m going to do?  Yes.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Cheers, man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Welcome to Dakar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  So, I\\'m really interested in your story.  I mean, you were born here.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes, right here in Dakar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right here in Dakar.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yep.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Went to New York.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I mean, I\\'m jumping ahead some but --\\n\\nTHIAM:  First job in New York was, uh, a restaurant job like --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Of course.\\n\\nTHIAM:  -- every, every immigrant.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  You know?  As a busboy, actually, but from a busboy, I just fell in love with what was happening behind the kitchen because, you know, I come from a culture where kitchen is a women activity and also, it\\'s like, I\\'d never seen men cooking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What, what was the type of cuisine you were learning?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Mostly American, continental American, and then it turned to Jean Claude, was French Bistro.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  And from Jean Claude, boom opened around the corner.  It was, like, early \\'90s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wait a minute.  Boom on Spring Street?\\n\\nTHIAM:  On Spring Street!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay, wait a minute.  I used to work at that store, at, before it was called WPA.  So --\\n\\nTHIAM:  Wow!\\n\\nBOURDAIN: -- we worked in the same restaurant kitchen.\\n\\nTHIAM:  In the same kitchen.  It\\'s like --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Downstairs kitchen.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Basement kitchen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was downstairs.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Oh, I can\\'t believe this, man.  Well, Boom, Boom was really the defining moment for me.  Boom had, like, this global ethnic/Italian --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you saw a window to start introducing African, West African flavors?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And it, it worked.  People were receptive to that.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Absolutely, yes, yes.  Oh, wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight we\\'re having yassa made with the local fish called thiof.  Cooked simply, on the bone, wrapped in foil, and steamed over the fire, served with a mignonette-type sauce of onions.\\n\\nOh, yes.\\n\\nGrilled mussels.  Sea urchin.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm, grilled mussels is cool.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that was good.  Mm, starving.  I mean, I\\'m really hungry.  So, what distinguishes Senegalese cuisine from the neighbors?\\n\\nTHIAM:  I think we have the best food in the continent.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Have you, you\\'ve traveled in the American south?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Um, I mean, do you notice some things about the food?\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s familiar.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nIt\\'s so familiar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s, I mean, look, like, shrimp and grits.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay?  I mean, I\\'ve eaten shrimp and grits in Africa many times.  I mean, they call it something else.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Exactly.  I think the most interesting part of American food is our, our contribution.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How did you feel when you first turned on TV and you see some, you know, rich white lady and she says, \"Well, we\\'re about to do,\" you know, \"my family, this is an old family recipe.\"  You know?\" An American classic, a traditional favorite.\"  Do you say, \"Wait a minute that\\'s -- \"\\n\\nTHIAM:  \"That\\'s mine!\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  \"That\\'s mine.\"  I mean, happy?  Proud?  Pissed off?  What?\\n\\nTHIAM:  Oh yes.  Proud, proud.  Happy too.  No, not pissed off.  No, that, I was never pissed off.  I thought, you know, yes.  I think food is such a great way of uniting people.  You know?  It\\'s like you\\'re breaking barriers.  Food is not only about feeding yourself here in Senegal, it\\'s a whole culture.  The most important value is what we call \"Teranga.\"  The more you share, the more your bowl will be plentiful.  It\\'s not how much you have, it\\'s how much you give. That\\'s what matters in Senegal.  So, so Teranga is that culture.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:13:33] BOURDAIN:  The call to prayer.  Five times a day, every day.  But Friday at 2 P.M. is the most important.  Dakar shuts down as people head to the mosque -- the invocation of the Muslim reverberates throughout the city.  The mosques fill to capacity, people spill onto the sidewalks and streets, they pray where they can.  In Senegal the majority of the people are Sufi Muslims, practicing a mystic form of Islam which is often considered more tolerant.\\n\\nFAMA DIOUF, CEO & ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT F. DIOUF PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO: Senegal is very different from other countries.  We all very tolerance.  We also have, in Senegalese family, Christian married to Muslim, Muslim married to Christian.  So, you don\\'t really know exactly who\\'s Christian and you don\\'t really know who is Muslim.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It is a comfortable assumption that Islam is oppressive to women -- that it allows no room for personal expression, that it forces women to hide themselves.  These ladies, however make that argument more complicated.  Fama Diouf is a photographer.  Oumy Ndour is a journalist and television presenter.  Minielle Tall is an entrepreneur and owner of a group of salons.  As the country changes many, if not most, have adopted the cultural values and styles of the west.  However, two of these women have chosen to wear the traditional hijab.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A lot of people who watch this, particularly women, look at the hijab in particular as an instrument, at the very least as an instrument of male oppression.  What would you say to them?\\n\\nOUMY NDOUR, JOURNALIST:  For me religion is a, uh, is a personal thing and I, and I decide, decided to, to get this.  So, why people keep on asking me every day, \"Why?  Why?  Why?\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I, I think the, the simple answer is that what to you is a personal lifestyle choice looks, too much of the world like a political choice.\\n\\nNDOUR:  It is a choice for me.  So, some of the Senegalese girls, they have a choice to wear Western clothes.  I have also as a right to wear (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nMINIELLE TALL, ENTREPRENEUR:  In a way the reason behind it for every Muslim, uh, will be modesty.  Whether you come from a rich background or a poor background, people should not judge you on the way you dress.  She doesn\\'t want you to be, like, \"Oh my gosh.  I love her hair.  Oh, her earrings!  Oh!  The watch!  No, you see us as something threatening but we are just here in peace.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about women\\'s roles here, traditionally?  In many of the African countries that I\\'ve been to often you will see the man walking up front and behind the wife and the children, you know, carry, carrying the, the bucket of water or, you know, laden down doing the work.\\n\\nDIOUF:  I mean, here, in Dakar, you\\'re not going to see it.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You say that with a -- with determination.\\n\\nDIOUF:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I am definitely sure about that, OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As if you will personally ensure that you won\\'t.\\n\\nDIOUF:  Yes.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSeriously, I think it\\'s time for women to change the face of Senegal.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not now?\\n\\nDIOUF:  They are not ready for that right now.\\n\\nTALL:  Well --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why not?  What\\'s missing?\\n\\nTALL:  You will have powerful women, like, arguing for what we call \"parite\" here.  So, gender balance.  And, then, you take that same woman and you tell her that her son is supposed to start cooking and doing the laundry.  Laundry -- there is even a word.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m sorry, what\\'s wrong with that?\\n\\nTALL:  So, for Senegalese women, taking care of her man and treating him as a king is part of who she is and she is taking proud of it.\\n\\nNDOUR:  It\\'s too easy to be a, a boy here in Senegal.  You do nothing, nothing.\\n\\nDIOUF:  There\\'s been men in the position of presidential but we can have, uh, also a woman in the head of, uh, Senegal.  If we don\\'t try, we will never know.\\n\\n[21:18:29] BOURDAIN:  Sometimes we get lucky.  We get to do things on this show because -- just because it\\'s a show, that are, frankly, awesome.  Like this, a small restaurant in Dakar.  The delicious smells of Senegalese cooking coming from the kitchen.  A band.\\n\\n(YOUSSOU N\\'DOUR PERFORMING)\\n\\nYoussou N\\'Dour -- one of the most beloved musicians on the African continent.  Famous throughout the world for blending of traditional music of the region with Cuban rumba, American jazz, and R&B.  Mbalax, as it came to be known, has had an enormous influence on musicians worldwide -- like that sting guy.  Tracy Chapman, and Saint Bruce of Asbury, and, most famously, his frequent collaborator Peter Gabriel.\\n\\n(YOUSSOU N\\'DOUR PERFORMING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  People started to talk about you when you age 12 when you started to perform, uh, professionally.\\n\\nYOUSSOU N\\'DOUR, SENEGALESE SINGER:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But did you come from a musical tradition?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  My mom, she\\'s a griot.  Griot are the storytellers and they are also singers, rappers, and everything.  And I, I grow with my grandma, she was a big singer.  She gave me a lot of things.  And from there going to the school for two years, then left the school and start my career.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Tonight we are having a beef mafe, which is a stew thickened with ground peanuts.  There are similar preparations throughout West Africa, but the Senegalese version is particularly great.  Sear the beef, cook the onion, garlic, peppers, and carrots, deglaze with ground peanuts and broth, bringing up all that good stuff from the pan, then simmer until tender and awesome.  Serve hot over rice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  Ah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That looks good.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  That\\'s good.  Good, good, good, good, good.  Thank you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  This is very, very good.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  The symbol of connection, Mali and Senegal, is the mafe. This dish, you can appreciate here, you can appreciate in Mali also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what\\'s the future?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  Future?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The future.  Twenty years from now, where will Senegal be?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  What I hope is in 20 years, Senegal is going to be the place for great and big contribution of what we call Islam.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Do you think there\\'s any danger of, the kind of radical Islam that we see taking hold in many places in Africa?\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  All these people who are using the religion, Muslim religion, to do bad things, I think Senegal have example.  I this country have models of the religion.  This country, you know, you are here, I\\'m doing my local bissap and you are with your beer and country 95 percent Muslim.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  And, I think this example can help all the world.  BOURDAIN:  I hope so.  Inshallah.\\n\\nN\\'DOUR:  Inshallah.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n[21:23:23] N\\'DOUR:  Merci, thank you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:27:14] BOURDAIN:  Time stopped.  That\\'s what it seems like in the City of Saint-Louis when the sun is at its highest and the streets are empty.  A hundred sixty miles up the coast from Dakar, the one-time capital was a hub for all French West Africa -- an important port at the mouth of the Senegal River.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Every culture has an iconic, much loved, street food -- the kind of thing you yearn for when you\\'re away.  We have our dirty water hot dogs in New York, here they have Ndamb (ph).\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What people have described as a bean sandwich, but what is really a spread of spicy lentils on a baguette.  You buy your baguette at the bakery, bring it over to the nice lady, she slathers on the good stuff, and there you go.  And it is, indeed, addictively delicious.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, everything comes, came through here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that we can understand, the case of Saint Louis, the situation of Saint Louis, we can understand it if only if we know well the geography.  Because what made this town according to me is the river.  Because it runs through five states, five countries.  Mali, Mauritania, Senegal of course, Guinea.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, everything comes --\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nAttitude about many things are decidedly different here.  Where many post-colonial cultures around (INAUDIBLE) conflicting about their bloodlines -- picking black or white to identity with -- here, people are proud of who they are and where they came from.  All of it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m curious why the post-colonial experience in Senegal is so different than the post-colonial experience almost everywhere else.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that the pre-colonial and the colonial in Senegal is different, also.  Not only the post-colonial experience, because in Saint-Louis we had lots of influences, I think.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Arab, Portuguese, uh --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, because, yes, the Portuguese and the English first they were here and after that, the Moroccan from Morocco.\\n\\nMARIE-CAROLINE CAMARA, ST. LOUIS METISSE:  My feeling was this -- that because we are at the crossing of various roads, eh, independently from the colonization prior, makes the Senegalese people very open- minded, very good negotiators, also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Marie-Caroline Camara is a St. Louis metisse -- Senegalese father, French mother -- and she\\'s hosted a lunch with some friends and colleagues, all of whom consider themselves Senegalese first, before anything.\\n\\nCAMARA:  And, and my feeling compared to other African countries, is that maybe it\\'s come also from, uh, the, the Wolof women because the metis family here, people were really married.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, at least the descendants --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Between Wolof and other groups.\\n\\nCAMARA:  -- recognize, you know?  Compared to West Indies where even if people had, um, some white people had children with, um, their slaves they were not recognized.  Here all these, uh, children and unions were recognized.  So, for me that is very special.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The most, eh, um, riches in, in Senegal is our culture.  Is not, uh, petrol, oil, or, other thing.  I think that it\\'s our culture, our -- our type of life, our customs.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Music.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Music, yes.  Our, uh, culinary art.\\n\\nCAMARA:  OK, so, we are eating Mulet Farci a la Saint-Louisienne.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Lovely.\\n\\nCAMARA:  It\\'s a big fish from the river.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mulet Farci -- stuffed mullet.  The fish deboned and filled with a seafood farce of fish, herbs, vegetables, and bread and baked.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s an amazing meal.  Delicious.\\n\\nCAMARA:  Amazing meal?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, really good.\\n\\nCAMARA:  OK.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, how are things in Senegal today?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How are things?  What kind of things?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is the environment good for business in Senegal now?  Is it getting better?  I mean, there seems to be a lot of money coming in Dakar.  You see buildings going up, somebody\\'s building.  CAMARA:  The key thing for me will be the development of, uh, business\\n\\nand because when you look at all these young people in Saint-Louis and there is no companies to employ them.  Let the young people take a big part of the power, which is not in our tradition, but we need the young people to be, to be strong.\\n\\n[21:32:20] BOURDAIN:  If you could compare yourself to someplace else in, in another major city in the world, the New York of West Africa?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Hong Kong of West Africa.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, oh, ouch.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nYes, you\\'re, you\\'re right.\\n\\n(WOMAN SINGING)\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:37:09] BOURDAIN:  Money.  You like it, I like it, we all like it, and there\\'s a flood of green pouring into the developing world. Green-head foreign speculators for sure, but also entrepreneurs, often educated abroad but returning to build businesses around a growing middle class.  Telecoms to financial institutions to the restaurants that grow up around them.  Maquis were once neighborhood, working- class dive bars.  Now many are becoming more respectable drinking establishments.  The Brooklynization of Africa begins.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cheers.\\n\\nI join Pierre, his film producer\\'s brother Christian Cham, and their friend Papa Madiaw Ndiaye, a local business man.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who is joining the middle class in Senegal?  Where are they coming from?\\n\\nPAPA MADIAW NDIAYE, BUSINESSMAN:  Most of the people are local people who now get proper training.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nNDIAYE:  And then you have a small group of guys like us who went abroad and are coming back.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, a phenomenon that I have seen in other countries in West Africa was one where people leave either because of war, oppression, necessity, financial, education.  And when they come back, there is resentment.  How do they feel about people like you who go and then come back?\\n\\nNDIAYE:  You know, unlike most other places over here, there\\'s a tremendous amount of pride in your family.  Senegalese rarely go and just cut off.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Cut off, yes.  It\\'s true.  No, that\\'s true, but in addition to people who go, they send money back home.\\n\\nCHRISTIAN CHAM, FILM PROFESSOR:  There is more money coming from the immigrants than the money that we receive from the World Bank of IMF or anything like that.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why is this the case in Senegal?  Where does this attitude come from?\\n\\nNDIAYE:  It\\'s just the nature of the social fabric.  It\\'s not an individual -- individualistic society.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What about the French colonial experience?  Uh, that too, was it different than --\\n\\nNDIAYE:  Very different from Senegal to the other countries.  Oh, it\\'s drastically different because the French used Senegal as their out -- as, as their anchor for their colonial expansion.  The French then said, \"Okay, you Senegalese, we\\'re going to train you up to, um, borderline high school education and you\\'re going to be the forefront -- the fulcrum of our, um, of our  administrative service.\"  So, if you go to Cote d\\'Ivoire, you go to Burkina, a lot of the guys who are running the, the, this administration were Senegalese.\\n\\nCHAM:  I think one of the major differences between Senegal and the other countries, not that we\\'re better or anything like that.  But, in Senegal it\\'s probably one of the only country in West Africa, probably in all Africa, where I can be from one a different ethnic group but we can talk without French using our local language and understand each other.  Because everybody speaks Wolof.\\n\\nNDIAYE:  I, I\\'m -- I happen to believe that, um, this world is going to be a better place when more cultures are actually given a chance to be put at the table.\\n\\n(DJILY BAGDAD PERFORMING)\\n\\nDJILY BAGDAD, MUSICIAN:  Each generation has its mission.  We have a saying in Wolof, we say, \"God is great.\"  And, you always say where there is no solution, you say.  And you leave it in the hand of God. But we, we tell people, \"This is in our hand.  This is our future and the future of the next generation coming.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As relatively good as things have been for Senegal democracy, as it turns out, requires regular maintenance, diligence needed, and the willingness to stand up.  Djily Bagdad is a musician and activist who\\'s doing what, well, the Last Poets and Chuck D. and others have done before him.  Say things that are important, loudly and often.  They call them \"Dibiteries\" and Dibi is generally grilled spiced lamb, hacked into pieces, and served on grease stained paper with grilled onions and mustard on the side.\\n\\nBAGDAD:  Wow! BOURDAIN:  That was quick.  From the beginning, I mean, was there\\n\\nalways this, like, a social justice, um, political component to what you were doing musically?\\n\\nBAGDAD:  From day one.  The first thing we did was go do a campaign called \"My Voting Card, My Weapon.\"  And we did songs and we did mobile concerts all over the country to raise awareness and it was the bum rush in the various spots.  Everybody went to register.  That\\'s, that\\'s the step that\\'s leaving us, you can see, that\\'s the step into being conscious of what your power is.\\n\\n[21:42:17] BOURDAIN:  In 2012, then President Abdoulaye Wade fell victim to the \"Maybe I Should Be President For Life\" syndrome that afflicts so many of his neighbors.  He proposed amending the constitution, so that he could run for a third term, as well as creating a new Vice Presidential position which many feared he intended for his son.  Djily, and many, many young people like him, were having  none of it.  They formed a group called \"Y\\'en A Marre,\" or \"Fed Up.\"  Using music as a draw and a hook they threw enormous rallies across the country, made aggressive and innovative use of social media, all in the cause of getting out the vote and shutting anti-Democratic initiatives down.  It worked.\\n\\nBAGDAD:  I know that, like, with this specific movement that we started and raising awareness I think the African union of people can start from here because this is amazing.  The new generation will learn from what we\\'ve done and maybe the next president might not be a politician at all.  You never know.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Obvious question -- why don\\'t you run for office?\\n\\nBAGDAD:  I don\\'t know.  I\\'m not, I\\'m not -- I\\'m not an aspiring politician, not at all.  But I can see my help -- myself helpful for my community.  We have everything to emerge.  It\\'s about believing in ourselves and trusting ourselves that we can do it.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:48:09] BOURDAIN:  Lac Rose, known for its pink hue and salt harvesters, sits near the Segalese Coast and, not too long ago, was also the finish line for a legendary trans-African endurance race.\\n\\nJEAN HAZARD (ph), PARIS-DAKAR RACER:  You OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I\\'m great.  No problem.\\n\\nDriving up to 10,000 grueling kilometers from Paris, south through Spain, across Morocco, down the Western Sahara, all the way to, well, right here.  The Paris-Dakar rally tested its drivers like no other race, sometimes driving over 20 hours a day over ground like this.\\n\\nSo, this is the same road the rally, Rally Dakar, took.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jean Hazard (ph) is a Senegalese of Lebanese descent who grew up here watching the final stretch of the race.  It was a galvanizing event for him.  He has since completed the race himself, three times.\\n\\nHAZARD:  So, when I was young, I came with my parents to see the arrival of the Paris-Dakar race.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nHAZARD:  That\\'s why I like to, to make races.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s been eight years since specially modified, true off- road vehicles, with powerful engines and cutting edge designs, roared across the desert and through tiny African villages.\\n\\nI, of course, had to try out one of these beasts and it\\'s about much fun as you can have while wearing pants.\\n\\nHAZARD:  Like this.  It\\'s OK.  You can put the three if you want.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Three?\\n\\nHAZARD:  Very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK, where am I going?\\n\\nHAZARD:  Turn, turn.  Nice, it\\'s nice, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Just like this.\\n\\nHAZARD:  First time?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good pace.  Yes, it\\'s like driving in snow, huh?\\n\\nHAZARD:  Yes, yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After tear-assing around for a few hours, it\\'s traditionally chicken and beer on the beach.  We\\'re joined by Jean\\'s fellow Paris-Dakar racers -- Mame Lesse Diallo (ph) and Adbou Thiam (ph).\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My friend Mame Lesse made 12 times the Paris- Dakar.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Twelve times.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Twelve with bike.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Motor bike.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Motor bike.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On a motor bike?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wow.  So, what happened?  It stopped in, uh --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The last race was in \\'07, in \\'08, uh --  BOURDAIN:  2007?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  In, in, in 2008 we were at the start and we didn\\'t start.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We didn\\'t start.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They cancelled the, the race.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In 2008, officials shut the event down with racers from all over the world at the starting line.  A response to the murder of four French citizens in Mauritania and to the discovery of potential terrorist threats against the race in the region.  The race, now called the Dakar-Rally, was moved off the African continent and currently runs much of the length of South America.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But will, will it come back?  What do you think?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here in Senegal?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Never.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Whoa.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I hope so!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Never.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why?  Why?  Why never?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because these people, when they leave, they did I not in a fair way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you think they don\\'t deserve to have it back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But there\\'s still, is there still racing here within the country?  Within Senegal?  I mean, you race.\\n\\nHAZARD:  We have, after South Africa, the second circuit in all over Africa.  It\\'s very, very, very, important for us, for Africa, and it\\'s, uh, exceptional for us.  How do you like the chicken?  It\\'s OK?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, man.  It\\'s good.  Are you kidding me?  I\\'m hitting it hard.  So, you told me before that if I wanted to, I could get in a car and drive to Saint-Louis.\\n\\nHAZARD:  Uh-huh, just --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That way.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That way.\\n\\nHAZARD:  That way.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How long will it take?\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An hour and a half.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let\\'s go.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You\\'re going to Saint-Louis?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let me finish my chicken, then we\\'ll go.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:56:47] BOURDAIN:  Pierre Thiam\\'s Aunt Marie is the matriarch of the family.  She often hosts uncles, aunts, sons, and daughters, friends and relatives from near and abroad.\\n\\nTHIAM:  Teranga is hospitality, that\\'s the translation, but it\\'s, it\\'s, the, the most important value is really the way you treat the others.  Love, you receive love.  That\\'s what Teranga is.  So, today you are our guest so you\\'ll be treated with our national dish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Everyone comes together often over this iconic dish. Thiebou Jen, which in Wolof means, simply, \"rice with fish.\"  It\\'s pretty much the national dish of Senegal.  Today it\\'s Senegalese grouper scored and stuffed with a mixture of garlic, parsley and peppers then slow simmered in a hearty tomato broth.  Infused with a funkatizing goodness brought by fermented conch and salt fish.  Served over rice and vegetables.\\n\\nI\\'m going to watch you and I\\'m going to do what you do.  That\\'s good.\\n\\nThe meal is eaten from one communal platter, an experience both fun and instructive.  Sustenance and life lesson.\\n\\nMmm.  Oh, that\\'s good.  Oh, that sauce is awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Normally children are not allowed to talk and to go too far in the middle of the plate.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So they go to eat around the edges?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So you, you will have an adult, the mother or an aunt or something, cutting pieces of fish or meat for them.\\n\\nTHIAM:  It\\'s a way to teach them to be content with their portion.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Uh-hm.\\n\\nTHIAM:  You know?  Not only children, but everyone, you have to imagine that, the triangle in front of you and that\\'s the triangle that is your limit to the bowl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nTHIAM:  And you have to chew slowly, you have to be patient.  So, all these values are taught when we eat around the bowl.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, if I were looking for a metaphor for Senegalese society, this would be it?\\n\\nTHIAM:  This is it.  This is Senegalese society.\\n\\nSenegal is a special country.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A few years back, I got the words, \"I am certain of nothing\" tattooed on my arm.  Is what makes travel what it is, an endless learning curve, the joy of being wrong, of being confused. Africa, more than any other continent, needs to be seen by the world as both the place we all came from and where we are going.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n', 'tbilisigeorgia': '\\n[21:00:21] (SINGING IN GEORGIAN)\\n\\nANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\":  To Georgia.\\n\\n(SHA-LA-LA-ING PLAYING)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Georgia is probably a place you don\\'t know much about.  Few Americans, I suspect, could place it on a map.  It\\'s small compared to the super around it but vital.  Its significance far exceeding its relative size.  For nearly 70 years, it was a Soviet Republic, and since independence in 1991, Georgia has been on a wild and often deeply troubled ride as it struggles to obtain and maintain democracy. There has been a civil war, regional strife, and numerous provocations and invasions by Russia.  Geopolitically, it\\'s located in a hot spot, a strategic crossroads surrounded by Russia, Turkey, Armenia, oil- producing Azerbaijan and just a short distance away Syria and Iran.\\n\\nI wanted very much to see Georgia, but in November of 2015, I was having a very tough time getting there.  The hard realities of a television production schedule required me to be in Georgia\\'s shiny new version of Vegas on the sea, Batumi, but here I was stuck in Istanbul.  Hurricane-like weather conditions grounded my flight on the other side of the sea.  It\\'s an unforgiving medium, television.  And a first principle is that one minute you\\'re on top of the world, next minute replaced by a younger, prettier face.  Somebody hungrier with fire in their belly.\\n\\nZAMIR:  To, to, to, to, to bah live from Batumi.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I knew just such a person.  Someone who\\'d been hungering for my job for ages.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m talking about Zamir, of course.  Only a short flight away in Moscow and ready at a drop of a hat to jump on a plane and be my eyes and ears in Batumi.  I may have misrepresented things a little bit.  I may have promised him a reoccurring role in the show.  But I needed somebody on the ground, and I needed him quickly.\\n\\nZAMIR:  This is CNN.\\n\\n(CLEARING THROAT)\\n\\nWhen the producers of the American television program, \"PARTS UNKNOWN\" telephoned me and explained that I wouldn\\'t have to pay for anything I took from the mini bar, I was confident this was the break I was waiting for.  Maybe this was the glorious future for me in cable news.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED CREW MEMBER:  Can you go a little bit to your right, Zamir?  Right -- a little more.\\n\\nZAMIR:  But just when my -- for becoming next Wolf Blitzer are about to come true, Tony arrives, smashing my hopes on the reef of television broken dreams.\\n\\nPlease, feel at home now, like it\\'s Georgia.  And now, it could be another state, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You know.  How did you get here?  What, via what route?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Luckily, there was a direct flight twice a week through Moscow to Batumi.\\n\\n[21:05:13] BOURDAIN:  Two and a half hours, that\\'s all?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, just --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ugh, all right, what are we drinking, Zamir?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Do you feel like you\\'re rea for some tropical feel?  Because I have some surprise of Cha-Cha.  It\\'s like moonshine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Okay, yes, I\\'ll have -- I\\'ll try that because apparently, apparently I\\'m going to be drinking a lot of it while I\\'m in Georgia. This is I understand a --\\n\\nZAMIR:  It\\'s a part of local hospitality, but it\\'s over 40 degrees like alcohol proof, so welcome to Georgia.  Hope it will be an interesting trip for you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thank you.  If we were to go to a casino tonight, for instance, what do you think?\\n\\nZAMIR:  What is your game of choice?  Poker?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, maybe or --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Blackjack.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Roulette, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Roulette.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Maybe, roulette would be --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Craps.\\n\\nZAMIR:  That\\'s -- that\\'s quick.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Baccarat, James Bond played baccarat.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Not that good at that, but let\\'s see what they have.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not much going on in Batumi off-season as it turns out. The casinos are still going for the benefit mostly of Turkish dudes hopping across the border from their country where such vices are frowned upon.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Seventeen, 14, 16, 13.  Blackjack.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ewwff, brutal.  Tough day at the office.  There\\'s that great philosopher Wesley Snipes once said, \"Always bet on black.\" Going all in, Zamir.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nZAMIR:  Okay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Come on black.  Come on, black.  Yes!\\n\\nZAMIR:  It\\'s a good start, Tony.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Let it ride.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Run, rabbit, run.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ouch.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nZAMIR:  You need some nightlife.  I mean, the losers deserve some relieve, right?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, nothing like a loser in a nightclub and I emanate loser, so let\\'s go.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Let\\'s go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Unsurprisingly, Zamir and I suck at gambling with a force equivalent to a thousand suns.  I should have just pulled my pants down and handed over my money the second we walked into the door.  But actually, that came later.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m memorized by this bowl of electronic snakes.  Oh, they\\'re changing colors, either that or I have a brain hemorrhage.\\n\\nZAMIR:  No, they\\'re changing colors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, everything seems fine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, Larina, Raki, Raki, yes, Raki -- two Rakies.  Tony, maybe it\\'s time to think of a New Year\\'s resolution once you have inspiring moment.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTony, this is an interesting moment in my life.  I\\'m trying to get something going on and I want to go crazy with you tonight --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What happed -- you grew up in Turkey?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes.\\n\\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:12:35] BOURDAIN:  Batumi in daytime is a strange looking place. Not exactly forlorn off-season, just odd.  A mix of what are obviously big dreams and current realities.  What is going on here?  They\\'re building everywhere -- commercial and residential properties rising up out of the ground every few yards.  It goes on and on.  I meet up with Zamir at Sazandari, one of the cities older, more traditional joints.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Tony.  How are you feeling?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like something crawled inside my head and defecated and then died.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Listen, I think we\\'re getting old.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Getting?  Although, you\\'re looking very svelte I have to say, I\\'m impressed.\\n\\nZAMIR:  I -- you\\'re kidding me.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, you look good up on that pole.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Now listen, if we are on the Black list again, I think that\\'s the end of my career, but you know --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was a brief, but magnificent pole-dancing career I can tell you.  You went out in a flame of glory.\\n\\nZAMIR:  I wasn\\'t aware they\\'re so puritan kind of, you know, country and people are kind of, you know, I thought they had some sense of humor, but --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hair of the dog.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yep, hmm.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, we\\'re eating, what\\'s --\\n\\nZAMIR:  Well, actually traditionally, you know, Georgia is the man\\'s world.  I mean, men drink, eat, party and the women normally do know how to make people healthy and alive next morning after heavy drinking.  So Khashi, it\\'s kind of broth and it\\'s made of beef bones an joints, so the whole idea is just to suck out whatever alcohol still remains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So it\\'s a hangover soup?\\n\\nZAMIR:  It\\'s hangover soup.  BOURDAIN:  Oh yes, there\\'s tripe in there.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, all the joints.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is not the first thing I think of for hangover actually.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Oh, really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Maybe this will help.\\n\\nZAMIR:  It goes well with garlic.  You tried it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, I just dumped a whole bunch of garlic in there.\\n\\nZAMIR:  You think it\\'s marketable in the states as a real hangover dish -- a thing that should be a lot of clientele?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hmmm, no.\\n\\nZAMIR:  No, not really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The Khashi is not really working for me, but I absolutely love the Shahashuli (ph), the stew of slow-cooked veal with onion and tomato, heavily seasoned with coriander, fennel, garlic and chilies. Spicy!  I mean, it\\'s really like got some good zing in there.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Yes, feeling better?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I am.\\n\\nZAMIR:  Good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what has the club called offering you a job?\\n\\nZAMIR:  Not yet.  I mean, there\\'s very tough competition on that front.  To Georgia -- a local toast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As grateful as I am for him stepping in my time of need, it\\'s time for Zamir to head back off to Moscow.  I ain\\'t no fool -- the man clearly wants my job.  Tbilisi, in the Eastern part of the country, is Georgia\\'s capital city and it\\'s very different in every respect from Batumi\\'s off-season amusement park vibe.  It\\'s an old city founded in the 5th Century but also a very new city.  1.2 million people building their own world freshly emerged from some very, very dark times.  It\\'s a pretty incredible story, strong, rock-solid Orthodox hell of a lot of years under the Soviet boot, years of totally Wild West gangster-ism, endemic corruption.  Now, it\\'s a very different story.  Tbilisi is changing fast.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t know what it says about a place that since I\\'ve  arrived in this country, I\\'ve been in a literally a constant state of, I\\'m either drinking or hung-over.\\n\\nPAUL RIMPLE, JOURNALIST:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Or both.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Is that normal?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  That\\'s normal, yes, especially for visitors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re friendly here.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  But it\\'s a friendly kidnapping, you know?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Well, I actually -- I\\'ve read accounts of people who\\'ve actually were kidnapped in this country, who --\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, yes.  It happened once with, uh, U.N. monitors --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They came back like ten pounds heavier and hung-over?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  They -- they found them in a cabin up in the mountains partying.  They had bumped into a wedding party and were there for two days.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So how long have you lived here?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Oh, about 12 years, 12, 13 years.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you\\'ve been hung-over for 12 years?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, yes.  Pretty much.\\n\\n[21:17:11] BOURDAIN:  Paul Rimple is an American-born journalist and he\\'s seen it all.  He takes me to Tbilisi\\'s old city to eat at the Gabriadze Cafe.  When you first arrived, who was -- who was running things back then?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Eduard Shevardnadze.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ah, those were -- so the bad old days.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes, and it\\'s a real mixed legacy because the nation was still functioning as an outlaw ex-Soviet, you know, nation.  Then, Saakashvili just, kind of, emerged and the Rose Revolution happened, you know, and everything changed.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The country has run through a number of heads of states since the end of Soviet rule.  First, was the former Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Union, Eduard Shevardnadze who was ousted in 2003.  But to get a handle on Georgia today, you must understand the importance of one man.  Mikheil Saakashvili.  After Shevardnadze, he was elected president in 2004 and began to change everything.  Misha, as everybody knew him, transformed the country. And by making friends in the West, in Europe, and the U.S., he gained a lot of attention, both good and bad.  In 2013 though, he was ousted by the Georgian dream party who are still in power today.\\n\\nMost Americans watching this show will have a hard time even locating Georgia on a map.\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What do you think people need to know about this country?\\n\\nRIMPLE:  Two things in Georgia that are untouchable -- the church. Don\\'t mess with the church and don\\'t mess with Georgian food.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t mess with Georgian food?\\n\\nPAUL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Don\\'t mess with the church -- okay, I get it.  But to the food, why?\\n\\nPAUL:  Because, um, it\\'s tradition.  You don\\'t mess with tradition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m quickly finding that the cuisine here is really good -- really complex with sweet, sour notes that are reminiscent of, I don\\'t know.  I just know that it feels hauntingly familiar yet, utterly new and delicious.  Salad with orange, almonds and honey.  Grilled lamb ribs with tomograt (ph) sauce.  Slices of fried eggplant wrapped around a walnut filling.  And chkmeruli -- chicken slow baked in an oven and then simmered in garlic and milk.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mmm, that\\'s good.\\n\\nPAUL:  And Georgians will tell you, there\\'s no alcoholics in Georgia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No alcoholics.  Right.  Do you believe that?\\n\\nPAUL:  Absolutely not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  How do I get out of drinking?  How do I avoid chugging Cha- Cha?\\n\\nPAUL:  Say you have a heart condition.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A heart condition?\\n\\nPAUL:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nothing short of that will help?\\n\\nPAUL:  No.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jeez.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:23:52] BOURDAIN:  There it is, perched on a hilltop overlooking the capital, like the liar of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the bond arch villain.  Helipad, check.  Private zoo, check.  A big, shimmering glass box owned by Georgia\\'s richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili.  Known variously as \"the good oligarch,\" and as the mysterious guiding hand behind, well, everything.  Seldom seen in public, Ivanishvili, after making billions in Russia, went into politics in his homeland, creating the Georgia dream party and ultimately becoming prime minister in 2012.  Not everybody is on board, however.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The demonstration ended several minutes ago. Concrete demands of the participants were the Georgian government has to stop.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Russian gas is expensive.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Russian gas is not --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Gazprom is Putin\\'s weapon of blackmail.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Known as the Angry Bird, Tamara Chergoleishvili and her Pro-western decidedly anti-Russian defend liberty coalition, are in vocal opposition.  Recently, a move by the ruling party to sign a deal with Russia\\'s Gazprom for all Georgia\\'s oil needs, has caused dissention.  We meet at Sofia Melnikovas -- a much-loved bistro for the most loved, perhaps most iconic Georgian dish, Khinkali.  I understand that Georgia is not releasing, but looking around, compared to 2008, life looks good.  There\\'s money in the streets, shiny new cars.\\n\\nTAMARA CHERGOLEISHVILI, GEORGIAN POLITICIAN:  No, well, the thing is that, yes, things have changed.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia was the country that suffered the most among the former Soviet Republic\\'s economically.  And our economy totally collapsed, corruption, like, became like just the normal way of living.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Truly a pretty miraculous transformation, unlike --\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Yes, well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Anyplace.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  It happened because, like, people wanted it, I mean, and there was this demand.  That\\'s why revolution took place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh man, look at that.  Wow, that looks sensational.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Big, fat, juicy soup dumplings filled with spicy cumin- jacked minced beef in a hot, rich, potentially scalding broth.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  You have never tried that?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I have never.  No, I\\'m new to this country.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  According to tradition --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  You\\'re eating it with fingers.  BOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  That\\'s the whole thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm, so good.  Oh wow, these are terrific.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  I mean, this not something very sophisticated to eat.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mm, who cares?  This is a very religious country -- people identify themselves closely with Christianity.  Family based.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Exactly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And there seems to be a point beyond which the population will not go and to come around to comrade Putin, um, he seems to understand this very, very well.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  The way Putin operations is that, like, first Putin emanates strength.  I mean, he\\'s a bad guy.  I mean, there\\'s a consensus.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Like 80 percent of Georgians, like, believe that Putin is a very bad guy and Russians as well.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right, but he\\'s on the winning side.\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Yes, exactly so he\\'s a winner, so they don\\'t judge winners.  They say, \"Okay, we\\'re bad, but West is worse.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But are they wrong?\\n\\nCHERGOLEISHVILI:  Of course they are wrong.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Wherever you find a traditional, religious, conservative society, you\\'ll find a countervailing force.  Georgians, as a rule, are compassionate about tradition, about the way things are supposed to be done.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean that there aren\\'t rebels -- people pushing hard against the status quo.  Daring, creative souls like Chef Tekuna Gachechiladze.  At Culinarium, she\\'s taking to extremes the notion that Georgian food is in fact the fusion of all the past influences of the many forces who made their way, and forced their way, through the tiny country.  She\\'s focused on the next generation.\\n\\n[21:28:40] BOURDAIN:  Something that was said to me early on, what I need to know about Georgia is, don\\'t speak badly of, uh, religion and don\\'t mess with the food.\\n\\nTEKUNA GACHECHILADZE, CHEF:  For me, without innovation, tradition will die.  Because we can\\'t -- we can\\'t eat the same dishes what we used to eat in the beginning of the century because then, people did go for the hunt for two weeks.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Now, we\\'re sitting in front of computer and we can\\'t take so much fat.  It needs some lighter version of it and I\\'m trying to modernize Georgia cookings.  I think you\\'re hungry, so now I have to go cook.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThis is the cream soup with the caramelized onions and then salt.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really good.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  It\\'s really good for a hang-over.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s good because I have a hangover.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Uh, eat some more soup.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I could eat this all day.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  And then we\\'re going to drink Cha-Cha and you don\\'t have a hangover at all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  On my way to a new one.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  This is Georgia, you know, you have a hangover.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m learning every day.\\n\\nTEKUNA:  You cure yourself every day and then the next day, you still have a hangover and then you cure yourself.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh my God, I mean, having a --\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  I think we have to do one shot.  It\\'s going to help you and it\\'s going to help me.  And some wild trout tartare.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is delicious.  So, when you first started departing from the classics, what was the reaction from people?\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  What do you think?  It was big, like, um, controversial.  Even my grandmother, she\\'s like when I make her try this new thing, she\\'s like, \"Why?  Why do you have to do this?\"  And this is the very popular dish, chakapuli and then from lacos chakapuli, I\\'m trying to make people eat mussels.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Because the mussel is not very popular.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They\\'re beautiful mussels, too.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Yes, we have very good mussels.  But we need now and one more shot, so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Are there some Georgian dishes that should never change?\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  I always feeling very strongly to preserving the regional dishes.  It\\'s good to have this original version --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  -- but I\\'m giving the other option to try something new.  In my vision, it\\'s always to have a choice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Look, it\\'s a beautiful city.  It\\'s in the countryside. It\\'s fantastic.  People are nice and the food is really extraordinary, really, really something special.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  It is, it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  The drinking, however, is a problem.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Drinking.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cheers.\\n\\nGACHECHILADZE:  Cheers.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:19] BOURDAIN:  Tbilisi is one thing -- an increasingly modern city.  Smart cafes, boutique hotels, shops, galleries, the inevitable spoor of hipsters.  But outside the city, it\\'s not so different than it always was.  Agrarian, traditional, things done the way they\\'ve always been done.  The way it\\'s believed they should be done, until you reach the bizarre world along the border.  Only 90 kilometers northwest from Tbilisi in villages like one, Khurvaleti, where tiny Georgia\\'s predicament, comes clearly and brutally into focus.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nOver there, the Russian-controlled breakaway region, formally Georgian of South Ossetia.\\n\\nThe Russians took it in a five-day war in 2008.  It\\'s Russia now. This side of the wire is, at this precise moment anyway, Georgia, but who knows?  The border has been known to inch forward unpredictably. Often in the dead of night to the point that families have gone to sleep in Georgia and woken to find themselves living in Russia, swallowed up overnight.  Before 2008, Khurvaleti was home to more than 60 families.  Today, just nine families are left hanging on.\\n\\nDIMA BIT-SULEIMAN, GEORGIAN JOURNALIST:  So that cow is in South Ossetia, both of them.  There was story actually on that, an old lady basically woke up and her cow appeared to be on the other side of the fence because they did it during tonight.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  And so she would walk up every morning and would milk cows through the fence to get her milk.  It can\\'t be that bad, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Journalist and fixer, Dima Bit-Suleiman covered the war here seven years ago and continues to report from the region.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  So like that house.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They had the misfortune to go to sleep in Georgia and wake up in Russia.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  Exactly.  But look at this.  This is where the Russians sit and that is the base.  Probably a communication base, but they\\'re probably now watching us and the sign says, \"Attention, state border,\" so that\\'s something that appeared recently.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Thoughtfully, in English.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  The main problem to me is that we\\'re like a couple kilometers away from the highway.  Moving this border and blocking this highway would stop all the activity in the country basically. So, right now, the Caspian oil and gas goes through Georgia, and that\\'s the only route, except Russia and bypassing Russia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There\\'s an implied threat, you know?\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  That\\'s the main thing.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s saying, \"If I can do this, I can certainly go all the way right to highway at which point\" --\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  Basically, there\\'s a pipeline just here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, this is really a hand around your throat.\\n\\nBIT-SULEIMAN:  Absolutely, every day.  That\\'s why every 50 meters or even meter, which may be not that important for the whole country, like shorthand economic point of view.  It doesn\\'t matter, right? But, in terms of political threat, every meter is another step toward catastrophe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  We\\'re here for a supra at the home of Ushangi (ph) and Makvala Kokashvili.  A supra is like a feast, super traditional.  A pig is dispatched and broken into constituent parts.  The neighbors pitch in, helping to make three different varieties of a traditional cheese-filled bread, known as khachapuri, variously stuffed here with potato, beet leaves and stewed cabbage.\\n\\nDIMA:  And there\\'s one thing that we always do in Georgia.  We eat fresh herbs always and this is homemade wine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  There is, I gather, a very formal structure to these toasts.  DIMA:  Quite.  For the few, uh, few toasts at least, seven-ish I would\\n\\nsay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You sort of lose the plot after seven.\\n\\nDIMA:  No, no.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSeven is not a lot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Here\\'s how a typical supra works.  It\\'s more formal than it looks.  Custom must be observed, certain rituals performed.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want to say a toast for families.\\n\\n[21:40:06] BOURDAIN:  Proceedings are led by the Tamada, or toastmaster, often the head of the house.  The big-cheese, the dude but always the guy with the best rhetorical skills and the guy best able to stay sober while all around him are, well, not.  Because, there\\'s a lot of drinking in a supra.  It\\'s required.  In this case, our hosts have called upon Igor, their next-door neighbor.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  After each toast, your glass of wine or Cha-Cha, God forbid, must, and I mean must, be drained completely and refilled to the rim.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We must always remember and glorify our ancestry.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re toasting some pretty heartfelt, serious shit here, so hang in there and show some respect.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let\\'s remember them and drink to those who have passed away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is tough because the drink receptacles can grow larger as the toasts progress.  To like this horn for instance.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A toast for peace.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which is used because you can\\'t, even if you wanted to, put it down anything less than empty because it will pour all the table. So, drink up!  Then, there\\'s a mug and so on.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let us always see the peaceful united country.  A toast for Georgia.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To Georgia.  Then it\\'s time for the food.  Roast, stuffed goose.  Wow, look at that.  And shashlik -- grilled kebabs of pork with a sour plum sauce.  There\\'s also qorma, a slow-cooked stew of the pig\\'s heart and liver with onions, bay leaves and parsley.  It\\'s good bread.  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nDIMA:  If we have a choice, we prefer west to Russia because the future for our children is much better there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But they\\'re still here.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\nDIMA:  We\\'re not afraid.  They\\'re here, but we sleep peacefully. Without -- without fear.  And he says they can and will be here. We\\'ll meet them here.  It\\'s been six years we couldn\\'t go to the graves.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m a grown man, I\\'m not afraid of anything.  And I never cry but that day six years when I could no longer visit my father\\'s grave, I cried.  A toast for our children.\\n\\nMy God give them a long life, and health.  A toast for your child.  My God raise her wealthy and to be as you wish.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ugh, I don\\'t think -- I don\\'t think I can do this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When toasting little ones, you must drink the whole glass.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You have to drink it all.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m working on it, I\\'ll get there, I\\'ll get there.\\n\\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:47:33] BOURDAIN:  The wine region of Georgia is called Kakheti, a beautiful area East of Tbilisi made up of foothills and valleys below Caucasus Mountain.  In a hilltop village of Signage, there\\'s a well- known restaurant called Pheasants Tears.  The chef is a local guy, Gia Rokashvili, who works with what\\'s from the area.  Nothing too fancy, but always soulful and delicious and always served with local wines.\\n\\nKETI BOCHORISHVILI, DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMY, GEORGIA:  I like to show off my country.  You know, I want to sometimes scream, \"Look! This is my country.  Come and visit.\"  And maybe it\\'s part of my culture, parts of my personality, yes, we are just proud of our country.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, you should know this about me and the people I work with -- we don\\'t like working with officials.  We avoid tourists boards, official advisors, government employees.  We certainly don\\'t hang out with ministers of the countries we are shooting in, who always, always have an agenda and always want to skew our perspective on our subject.  But Keti Bochorishvili is an exception.  She is the Deputy Mister of Economy.  A remarkable woman, more remarkable for the fact that she is unique holdover from the previous administration. She goes on and on, never stopping in her efforts to convince the world that Georgia -- Georgia -- is the place to be.  And if you spend any time with this ferociously smart woman and her friend, gallery owner Tamuna Gvaberidze, you will understand and forgive us all, all of us on the crew for becoming completely beguiled.  I like the food already.  Love the food.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  Okay, good.  Food you like.  I hope wine, you like, and then if you like skin, then that\\'s the place.\\n\\nTAMUNA GVABERIDZE, FRIEND OF KETI BOCHORISHVILI:  And you have to dance also, Georgian dances.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Really?  I\\'m a really, really appalling dancer.  This is a problem for me.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  No, no, no you don\\'t do that.  You know you want to.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Now, I\\'m frightened.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  Two or three glasses of Cha-Cha and you\\'re ready to dance.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Enough Cha-Cha, anything is possible.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  I\\'m going to toast, take the break, ah, let\\'s toast for the -- I\\'m spontaneously thinking right now to achieve our goals and dreams.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To dreams.  The ladies convinced us to make the 90-minute drive to this village and this restaurant and, well, I\\'m quite happy they did.  By the time I\\'ve had some more of that delicious and lethal Cha-Cha, and many glasses of delicious Georgian wine, after boiled beets in a wild plum sauce, and freshly foraged mushrooms with chili pepper and mint and tarragon, baby lamb stewed in its own fat with cumin and cooked together with wild rice biryani style.  And delicious, delicious Tonis Puri.  Bread straight out of the outdoor tandoor-like clay oven.  After all this, I am convinced.  I am co- opted, I am recruited.  Count me as a useful idiot, a witting agent of the Georgian Ministry of Tourism, for I may as well be.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  But, um, I have to underline also that Georgian people are very optimistic, very cheerful.  They always see, you know, future in a very, and that drives the, you know, drives them.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Optimism.  Not a lot of it in this world right now.  I visit a lot of countries.  People are unusually helpful and friendly here.  Um, how should I put this?  People are really good looking here.\\n\\nIt is -- it\\'s sort of thing you notice.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  Do you know who you look like?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  No.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  The director, American.  David Lynch.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'m David Lynch, really?  He has better hair.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  I\\'m so happy he says he likes Georgia, really.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Why would I not?\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  You\\'re becoming a Georgian.  Be careful.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWe are all humans and we all love each other so we can sit around a table and we can just love each other.  And especially, with the help of wine, we can love more.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  You know, Georgians also like to drink for peace because peace was so important in our lives.\\n\\nGVABERIDZE:  I think we need to change the world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To freedom.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  OK, so now it\\'s your turn to say the toast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To this extraordinary place that has managed against all odds to endure all these years against so many powerful forces.  To two magnificent women.\\n\\nBOCHORISHVILI:  Thank you.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:56:02] BOURDAIN:  In this nifty neighborhood, just up the hill from downtown Tbilisi, is where Giorgi Gelovani is hosting a dinner. The food\\'s being prepared by Meriko Gubeadze (ph), the chef of the city\\'s beloved Black Line Brasserie.  And it\\'s going to be epic.\\n\\nGIORGI GELOVANI, MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS, GEORGIA:  I hope you find this --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It\\'s really good.\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Not too salty for you?  Because we love salted cheese.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes, so do I.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s great for your hangover.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They say that about a lot of things here, I notice.\\n\\nA variety of Georgian appetizers served pre-dinner, kind of like mezza.  Spinach with walnuts and wild capers, pickled carrots, cheese curds with roasted hazelnuts and mint, roasted eggplant seasoned with coriander.  This thing, this thing is amazing.  Kharsho, a stewed chicken cooked slow with ajika chili sauce, onions and an oft-used Georgian spices -- marigold flower powder and blue fenugreek.  So a lot of what we\\'ve been talking about since we got here, is, will\\n\\nGeorgia continue to look west or will it, as the Russians would prefer, look to the East?\\n\\nGELOVANI:  It\\'s not like the last 200 years or something.  It\\'s the -- throughout the existence of Georgia, even though we were surrounded and our immediate neighbors were Turkish, Persian, Arab, or whomever else, or Russian, okay.  The -- so the bias has always been towards, with Europe rather than with the East.  We believe that we are a part of that culture.  However, distant we might have actually been.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By regional standards, people don\\'t lower their voices here when they give you their opinion, more or less.  Okay, it is as --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We never did.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Honestly speaking, I think we\\'ve done better than, than many of the Soviet Republics.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So, what will it be like in ten years?  I mean, are you optimistic?\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Absolutely.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I\\'m always optimistic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Optimistic?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mildly optimistic.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Not so optimistic.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not so, yes.  If -- I would say, if Georgia is still independent, I\\'m very optimistic.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Right.\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Okay.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All right the next one is --\\n\\nGELOVANI:  And the next one is supposed to be for the children, right? Come on!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Or the life.\\n\\nGELOVANI:  Or life, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  To dreamers.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dreamers.\\n\\n(SINGING IN GEORGIAN)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Polyphonic songs are pure Georgia.  Eerily reminiscent, though, of mariachi music.  They\\'re about pre-Christian things -- things that have always been here since the beginning like wind and forests and forest spirits and lost love.  Hauntingly beautiful and otherworldly -- kind of like Georgia.\\n\\n(SINGING IN GEORGIAN)\\n\\n', 'montana': '\\n[21:00:19] ANTHONY BOURDAIN, CNN HOST:  Some people must live in great spaces where the sky goes on forever.  Where everyone must bend to the land.  Where to hunt, to fish, to sleep under that big sky aren\\'t activities, but a way of life.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was right here in those mountains that Cheyenne and Crow battle took place, but I like it.  It\\'s very peaceful, huh?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What was it like a hundred years ago?  Two hundred years ago?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much different.  This was never forested. This is the dry side of the river because the primary winds come from the west.  Rain tends to blow over here that brings the snow to the mountains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Legendary writer and poet Jim Harrison is one of those people and this is his home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Am I as old as I am?  Maybe not.  Time is an industry that could tip us upside down.  Yesterday I was seven in the woods.  A bandage covered my blind eye.  Sixty eight years ago later I could still inhabit that boy\\'s body.  I start thinking about a time in between.  It is the burden of life to be in the ages without seeing the end of time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Next time you turn off a news cycle filled with shouting bobble-heads convinced that America is devolving into a moronic inferno, questioning the greatness of your nation, maybe you should come here.  Here are your purple mountains majesty.  This is the landscape, the generations dreamers, despots, adventurers, explorers, crack pots and heroes fought and died for.  It\\'s one of the most beautiful places on earth.  There is no place like it.  Montana.  Many have come to claim their piece over the years, but before the prospectors and explorers there were the plains Indians.  The Absarika (ph) have been master horsemen since they adopted Spanish-introduced mustangs in the 18th Century.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  General Black Jack Pershing.  He called the Native Americans the centaurs of the plains.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Better known as the Crow they were once part of the larger Hadassah Tribe.  Centuries ago they split off on their own and wandered or were pushed by conflict with the Blackfeet, Cheyenne and Dakota until settling here in the Yellowstone River Valley.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That horse became everything to our people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Kennard Real Bird (ph) grew up ranching and raising horses here at medicine tail coulee which happens to be the exact spot where General George Custer had the worst day of his life.  Kennard raises horses for rodeo, the riding and for this, Indian relay racing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The athletic ability on them kids are just amazing.  The competition is intense.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They travel all over to compete at this collarbone smashing, skull cracking, bones snappingly dangerous sport.  Former allies and former blood enemies alike.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It requires a lot of courage.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I\\'ll bet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And a high threshold for pain.  It\\'s representative of a warrior mentality.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  One rider, three horses.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And they\\'re lined up and gun goes off.  It\\'s like a spontaneous combustion.\\n\\n[21:05:12] BOURDAIN:  Top speed is around 40 miles an hour and after each lap the rider dismounts at full freaking gallop and leaps hopefully on to the next horse.  Yes, it\\'s as dangerous and difficult as it looks.  The prizes at big events run into the thousands of dollars, but really, it\\'s about bragging rights.  And pride.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being in motion, in rhythm in time and in one, the death horse, they develop strength of character, and once they conquer that fear, that feeling of accomplishment is so great, when they walk back from that race they have this sense of pride and self-worth of sky high.  Now they\\'ve identified with their ancestors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ken\\'s wife Diane has prepared a lunch of buffalo steaks, potato salad, fry bread and Indian pudding made of Juneberry stewed with flour and sugar.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When I looked at my ancestors, they didn\\'t have diabetes and they didn\\'t have much cancer.  They were very strong, durable people, and I said, well, I\\'m going to start eating nothing, but buffalo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Over the course of your life, how much has this area changed?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Quite a bit.  We went and picked up a four-wheeler last Sunday.  It\\'ll be the first four-wheeler on the place.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Given those changes, what are the crow people going to be doing in 20 years?  Thirty years?  The horse is going to play an important part of the culture still?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think so, yes.  Because what\\'s a place going to be like without horses?  I wouldn\\'t want to be there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Who owns this land?  Can anyone really own it?  Who gets to use it?  These are big questions that cut across traditional ideological lines out here where they have real meaning, not theoretical meaning.  All this belongs to one man.  This guy.  Bill Galt.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re about a half mile from the confluence of rock creek and the Smith River.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Galt ranch is 100,000 acres of grazing land, mountains, cliffs and valleys.  There\\'s also some of the best trout fishing on the planet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bill, the water level on the creek looks good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  This is Bill\\'s friend, the author and journalist David McCumber.  They disagree on land use, a major issue.  Remember when you could do that and still be friends?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lee Kinsey is a professional outfitter who bill leases some areas of his property to for fishing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All this to outwit a fish?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I know.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  Go ahead and just let that tip high just straight up in the air.  Good.  Perfect.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bill\\'s fifth generation Montana, whose principal business is raising cattle.  He\\'s no weekend cowboy.  This is work and he pays a lot of attention to his land and a big issue for him and for just about everybody around here is the 1984 stream access law.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anybody that could access a stream via a public means could, in fact, use the stream even if it was private ground as long as they stayed within the ordinary high watermark of the stream.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Widely heralded by sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts, the law did not go down well with landowners like Bill.\\n\\nOh, got him.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Something took a bite.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  He\\'s still got a fish right in there, too.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, I see him.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Perfect! Hoop set, set!  Whoa!  Fish of the day.\\n\\nNice brownie.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right!  Beautiful thing! That\\'s pretty, but I will not eat you today, my friend.  Not today.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For lunch, a modest protein-centric repast of steak, a wagyu Angus hybrid bred and raised right here on Bill\\'s ranch.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There\\'s the marbling on the wagyu steak.  That\\'s what makes them good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh, that\\'s nice.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s pretty damn tasty, I can tell you.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  So you hold an opposing view, is that correct, on access?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The idea behind the stream access law that if you stay in water, it\\'s public.  I agree with that concept.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But where do you draw the line for private property risk? If the state were to pass a law that your restroom was public because of the public needed it in your house.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But just because this isn\\'t my backyard doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t isn\\'t any less mine than your toilet is yours.  We still pay taxes on every foot of it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m an old school lefty, you got to say, I kind of completely understand the property owner\\'s point of view here.  There would be no ambiguity in my feeling if I inherited this land and it had been in my family for generations and I looked around at it and wanted to keep people like it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If I were to go at a bar in town, and then I would ask, how do you feel about this issue, where would it break?  What do most people say?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Orlando.  Certainly divided right now in the middle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A lot of people are going to say, when I was a kid I used to be able to go hunt and fish.  And I can\\'t now, stuff is getting closed up.  I have some sympathy for that.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anybody that\\'s not complying has come access merely has to step into the stream when he hears you coming.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  The spirit of it makes sense.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The spirit of it is thievery.  We own it and I took it and it\\'s not stealing it without compensation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it\\'s still here.\\n\\n[21:10:35] BOURDAIN:  This isn\\'t about being a good neighbor.  Right? I mean, so, if people ask nicely more often than not, you\\'re going to say yes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.  We used to be --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Before stream access, we sort of required somebody to have commission if they just behave themselves.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  After stream access is when the outfitters came into the world not because we wanted to make money, but we wanted somebody there patrolling and policing it.  The outfitters take care of it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  A small stream like this can only take so much pressure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Really.  Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  And so, we try to manage it and fish it  responsibly, if somebody wants to walk all the way from the Smith five miles  up to here and do it legally, I say all of the more power to them.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what I\\'m saying.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:14:31] BOURDAIN:  At first look, you\\'d think this is the worst place on earth.  A ravaged, toxics, God-forsaken hill threatened from above, riddled with darkness below, but you\\'d be wrong.  Butte, Montana.  It is, in fact, heartbreakingly, poignantly beautiful.  The gallous frames seem eyesores for only a second before it becomes clear why they\\'re points of fierce pride for locals for whom they signify and commemorate anything.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For Montanas, many people consider it sort of a black eye.  I happen to think it\\'s sort of the essence of Montana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Aaron Parrett was born in Butte.  He\\'s a professor of literature and a chronicler of the city\\'s colorful literary history.\\n\\nThere is something beautiful about this city, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  The enduring decay.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like in Detroit or a buffalo or a Cleveland, you can see the aspirations of the builders or the people who they were building for.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As I\\'ve gotten older I kind of think about it the way Europeans romanticized those ruins in Greece and Rome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beat us.  America is a crapulous (ph).\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In its heyday, Butte produced tens of billions of dollars\\' worth of copper that built, well, America.  That helped power the country, defended against Germany and Japan.  Without this hill, no copper wire, no electricity.  At the turn of the century, Marcus Daly\\'s amalgamated company consumed its competitors and became anaconda copper.  By the \\'20s, the company as it\\'s referred to was one of the largest corporations in America.  Generating staggering wealth by todays\\' or any days standards.  People came from all over the world to make their fortunes here or simply for steady work, a better life.\\n\\nCornish, Welsh, a lot of Eastern Europeans.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Croatians, Serbs, very ethnically diverse.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  By Montana standards or by any standards?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say by any standards, it\\'s kind of a micro version of New York City.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Meaderville was an Italian neighborhood and developed a tradition of supper clubs.  Lidia\\'s was opened in 1946 by Linda Michelet (ph) in the Fourmile, the valley below Butte.\\n\\nSo what is a supper club?  I\\'ve heard about this tradition, but I don\\'t really understand what distinguisher a supper club from a restaurant.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At least in Montana the supper clubs are a variation on Meaderville-style involves this anti-pasto beginning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sliced beats, sweet potato salad, salami and cheese, side salad, pickled peppers and breadsticks.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And then when you actually get your entree, you get oddly enough get ravioli or spaghetti or here both, but also French fries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Odd.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That may be unique to Montana.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For Ontre, huge scallops and white wine sauce - me noticing were pretty much -- around here, I go for the extra thick tenderloin of beef, thank you very much.  This is whacky.  It makes no sense.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is somewhat bizarre to have scallops and French fries.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Meaderville no longer around?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, it\\'s not.  It was followed up by the pit in the early 60s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  For the 70 years, it was hard rock mining blasting and digging tunnels deep into the ground, by the 1950s mining was moving increasingly to above ground, open pit which meant fewer jobs and a bigger, more visible footprint.  By 1955, the Berkeley pit had become the largest open-pit copper mine in the world.  As it expanded it devoured Meaderville and surrounding neighborhoods.  There was money down there to be dug out of the ground and that\\'s what Butte had always been about from the beginning.\\n\\nIn 1983, the pumps that held back the groundwater from thousands of miles of tunnels beneath the city were turned off.  The pit filled with 30 billion gallons of water, and as mine tailings and mineral refuse contaminated the water, it became a giant insanely toxic lake of sulfuric acid.  A monument to greed and heedless exploitation of the earth and something eerily, yet tragically beautiful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  If you\\'re still living here, you have to have some kind of weird, perverse pride in the pit?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Correct me if I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You nailed it.  Obviously, the pit is an enduring emblem of that rapacious capitalist greed but you also have people near who are proud of where they live.  The history of Butte, in many ways, is you know, this town that should have died, but never did. Part of that is luck, geographically, but also the character of the people here.  You know, they endured.\\n\\n[21:19:14] BOURDAIN:  As you might have gathered by now, this is a working-class town and unusual in that it\\'s a union town.  A proudly union town in an otherwise very red state.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Butte is the most interesting, important town in America that nobody knows about.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bryant McGregor is the owner of the silver dollar saloon in what was once Butte\\'s Chinatown.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Can we call ourselves Butte America?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Amanda Curtis, a former state congresswoman was born of the labor movement.  She\\'s a unionist and an advocate for workers and this solidly Union City she calls home.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you got off the boat at Ellis Island it said Butte pinned to your shirt and it wasn\\'t Butte, Montana, right? It was Butte, America.  We were founded by European immigrants who came from socialist countries with all of these crazy socialist ideas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Would you say Montana in a stereotypical way fairly relatively socially conservative?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, absolutely, but Butte is a labor town.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nobody knows anything about union history.  And now, they don\\'t teach it.  When the country was at its peak, unions were at their peak.  Wages were at their peak, unions were at their peak.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That was then, this is now.  This is the era of I\\'ve got mine, Jack.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That\\'s what makes Butte different.  It\\'s not I\\'ve got mine.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It isn\\'t?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We\\'ve grown community out of taking care of each other.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You have to remember what it was like for workers before unions, if you can imagine.  Men worked under ground for as little as $3 a day, 10 to 12-hour shifts, six days a week.  Thousands died over the years in industrial accidents or from silicosis, lungs ravaged by the airborne silica dust.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You don\\'t have any rights in your workplace unless you bond together and have a collective voice.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  In a one-company town despite hiring assassins and strike- breakers, Buttes thousands of workers successfully managed to unionize.  Labor costs increased while copper prices slammed. Anaconda responded by moving their production increasingly south.  Way south.  To Chile with such impediment as labor laws and fair wages were more malleable.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We serve as the example about what happens if you allow unfettered capitalism.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  But isn\\'t there something beautiful about unfettered capitalism?  Because look, this structure here --\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, yes, we powered the entire world.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  As somebody making their money in the God damn United States of America first.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I feel I\\'m a patriot and you\\'re taking jobs away from America to export them overseas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You\\'re not.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  You\\'re not.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And we\\'ve been talking about this for decades in this country right?  Keep our jobs here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes!\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:25:55] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Time sinks slowly to the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench.  She\\'s tired of light and it\\'s feared Black.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  They say that Butte is a mile high and a mile deep and to get an idea of what they mean you\\'ve got to go down.  Down deep into the hill.  An intricate warren of tunnels riddled through the rock and soil that lay beneath the city was flooded forever by water and darkness.  The orphan boy mine is one of the few remaining hard rock mines in the city.\\n\\nToday it serves as a training facility for the Montana tech school of mines and engineering.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are five generations of mining here.  In order to survive and provide the resources for America, these people were super skillful.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Jim Keane is a state senator and labor advocate who grew up working the mines of Butte.\\n\\nHow many miles of tunnel under Butte total?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ten thousand miles of tunnel.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Ten thousand miles.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I figured --\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Like this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They\\'re smaller, usually.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Larry Hoffman is a longtime mining engineer and instructor. Matt Krattinger is a new guy.  A hard rock miner by day, he likes to relax by spending his free time down here playing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I come mining for fun on my days off.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  OK.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It gets in your blood and you get a lot of pride in it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  These guys like it underground, and even more, they seem to like drilling holes deep into the rock face.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to drill?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pull that out.  And then you get the feel for where the weight sets on it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yes.  Cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You do that several hundred times a day, though. It\\'s good!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Sweet!\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The community recognized the miner was at the top of the food chain.  When I grew up he was considered just like a doctor or a lawyer because everybody knew he was the one making everything work.  The other thing about mining is that it\\'s so intensive.  I mean, you need engineers.  You need guys running ventilation, mechanic or carpenter or a pipe fitter.  It\\'s just such a diverse asset to have all these different types of people.  That\\'s what was so good about it.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Mining was always dangerous, but these men are proud of what they do and of the generations who came before them, who built neighborhoods and schools and helped power the nation.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They loved their work.  They raised their families.  They worked all the time.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  It was a destination with hopes and dreams of hard work leading to a better life.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, the company is a son of a bitch, let\\'s face it, but they were our son of a bitch.  So, you know, that\\'s just the way it was.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The community worked to support the people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here\\'s the fun part!\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Cool!\\n\\nHow many holes do you usually drill to make a round?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Between 20 and 30.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  What is a round?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This pattern has to be drilled out and every time you advance the face that is a round.  You drill it, you load it.  You blast it, you muck it, you bolt it and you drill it again and that\\'s a cycle.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'re in the loading process right here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s all prime and top priming in this hole. Quick, fill it away.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Back in the day it was dynamite, but in the -- they started switching over to this stuff.  Anfo, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We got everything in charge and uploaded.  Now we get to time it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is kind of where I got hooked on mining.\\n\\n[21:30:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I set that first round off.  This is kind of where I got hooked on mining.  And I set that first round off.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do we do another one?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It\\'s fascinating. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is where it all starts.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody got everything out?  Four seconds of silence.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right, everybody\\'s good?  Everybody\\'s ready?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  Fire on the hole.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One, two, three.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to mining.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That\\'s deeply satisfying.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh yeah.  Very cool.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can we see the smoke?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Through that vent, get out?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.  The smoke will start moving towards us.  We got to get in the smoke.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Oh yeah.  Smells like victory.  This is the smell of mining.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We\\'ll see if it all worked at last.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  That shock wave is awesome.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Isn\\'t it?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Yeah.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is like being an astronaut right now.  When we go in there you can be the first person in the world to see what you\\'re seeing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Did you break it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Nice.  Well, happy that it worked.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I\\'m very happy with it.  It really came out just the way it should.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well that\\'s another six-foot advance.  And that is around.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Beautiful thing.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I fell in love with the dark and the blowing things up and the people.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The people is a big thing.  You meet some of the most interesting people.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n[21:35:38] BOURDAIN:  About one third of Montana is public land.  It was set aside for the people of the United States of America.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, it is intended for multipurpose use.  Timber harvest, grazing land, hiking, fishing, hunting and mining.  These open lands are important to hunters and anglers like Dan Bailey.  He\\'s the Montana representative for Pheasants Forever.  An organization working to conserve pheasants and other wild life in careful management.\\n\\nDAN BAILEY, PHEASANTS FOREVER REPRESENTATIVE:  So this is a piece of property that\\'s owned by Pheasants Forever.  It\\'s open to public access.  This is through Montana\\'s block management system.  We signed in, they collect all of the tags.  They know who\\'s on the property.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Today, me and my friend Joe Rogan are going after some delicious pheasant for dinner.\\n\\nJOE ROGAN, PODCASTER AND SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Yee-haw, ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Joe is of course the voice of the UFC and the host of the widely popular podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience\".\\n\\nIn recent years, Joe has become an advocate from the notion that you should, whenever possible, know where your food comes from.\\n\\nROGAN:  The connection that you have with your food when you kill it yourself, you know, it\\'s just -- it\\'s a totally different experience.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I believe that if you choose to eat meat that you -- there should be a little bit of guilt and shame involved.  Something did die.  So there should be a sense of loss and then understanding.\\n\\nBAILEY:  Right here, this is it.  I mean you know where your food comes from.  That\\'s as small circle as you can get.\\n\\nIt\\'s only the three things we can hunt here, a Hungarian Partridge which is a small bird and the big kind of sharp-tailed grouse and then rooster pheasants.  So no hen pheasants so I\\'ll call out what it is. BOURDAIN:  Yeah.  I\\'m going to wait for you because I\\'m sure that would be what I identify.\\n\\nBAILEY:  It\\'s only one person on one side of Joe.  I need one person on the other and I\\'ll run the dogs in the middle.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Which way they\\'re going to break, do you think, they could get?\\n\\nBAILEY:  In any which way.  We\\'re hoping over us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Hen, hen, hen, hen, hen, hen, hen.\\n\\nROGAN:  What happens if you accidentally shoot the hen?  Do you get in trouble?\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Work still, you\\'ve heard about the walk of shame?  So you really, you have a split second to determine whether it\\'s a shootable bird, I think.\\n\\nROGAN:  Okay.  Well, we\\'ll count on you.\\n\\nBAILEY:  That\\'s a rooster.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I could have shot at that too.  That was an easy shot, shit.\\n\\nROGAN:  From those, yeah one of those days, huh.\\n\\nBAILEY:  Public land in Montana, we\\'re fortunate we have a lot of them.  But, you know, they get a lot of pressure and so when you get one of these birds it\\'s pretty special.\\n\\nROGAN:  Public hunting is always, always a lot of work.\\n\\nBAILEY:  In general, anybody and everybody can come out here and chase your birds so.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  I can see a bunch of birds out there.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nROGAN:  I saw a bunch of pheasants scattered.  Let\\'s get serious about this.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  All right.\\n\\nBAILEY:  We\\'ll take these dogs to the river.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Rooster.\\n\\nROGAN:  Oh nice shot.\\n\\n(OFF-MIC)\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Going to get up on that bank. ROGAN:  Who got it?\\n\\nBAILEY:  Anthony caught it.\\n\\nROGAN:  Nice.\\n\\nBAILEY:  I missed that one over here.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Good boy.  Come (inaudible), come on.  Good boy.  Come on jugger.\\n\\nROGAN:  Nice shot.\\n\\nBOURDAIN:  Bring here.  Bring it here.

So, you know, as someone who\\'s arranged to have like a two-, three-week vacation in Greece will probably want to visit like at least two or three islands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So how many islands in this island group?\\n\\nLAMBROS: The Cyclades?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Cyclades.\\n\\nLAMBROS: It\\'s about 15, maybe more. There\\'s Andros, Tinos, Mykonos, Syros, Paros, Naxos...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And too -- and Jermaine.\\n\\nLAMBROS: That\\'s it, and more.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right, and the rest.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And the rest, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A lot of history here in the Greek islands. On Naxos in particular, where Zeus himself was said to live. Where his son Dionysus frolicked and presumably drank and threw orgies and dropped E, and danced all night to the B.C. version of EDM.\\n\\nThese days you have to go over to Mykonos for that. Anyway, Lambros here runs a bar in Athens, but comes out here frequently to get away from it all.\\n\\nLAMBROS: If you were a Greek, you would definitely dig boarding a boat and leaving for the Cyclades. You know, there\\'s this air of mysticism about them, like an arcane feeling, that definitely doesn\\'t exist in the other islands, the archipelagos in Greece.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A big glass of Raki on the rocks.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And a big glass of regular...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh jeez, that\\'s a - it\\'s a little more than I would sort of -- well, I\\'ll have a sip.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yamas. Good morning.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yamas.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, it kind of puts the day into perspective when you start off with a -- with a drink.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah. Wow, it\\'s a perfect day for the beach.\\n\\nLAMBROS: It\\'s a perfect day, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I like the wind here, and actually it\\'s one of the really cool things about this island is it\\'s that breeze, you know, that always.\\n\\nLAMBROS: It\\'s like our main past-time, talking about the wind. Wind\\'s coming, the wind\\'s leaving, which beach do you go to when the wind is coming from the north.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Really?\\n\\nLAMBROS: The south. Yes, most islands want to claim that actually like Odysseus, Ulysses was from there.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Or homer was from there. It\\'s -- everyone wants to claim, you know, a bit of fame from the mythology to their islands.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I can tell you this, Ulysses was kind of a dick. He left his wife alone for how long? And how far was he from home? He wasn\\'t that far.\\n\\nLAMBROS: he wasn\\'t that far.\\n\\n[21:05:00] BOURDAIN: I mean, he was just dicking around in the islands, you know. He couldn\\'t go home and, you know, throw the wife a quick one, you know, before -- and then he gets pissed because she\\'s got to look elsewhere?\\n\\nLAMBROS: He came up with this unbelievable story.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yeah, but baby -- I don\\'t know...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: He went back home, and he said, \"Darling, you won\\'t believe what happened to me.\"\\n\\nBOURDAIN: There were these chicks. They were singing. They, they lured the ship into the rocks, and they weren\\'t hot, though. They were really ugly.\\n\\nLAMBROS: I think you summed him up perfectly.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: there you go, the Iliad. I see a lot of empty villas, like a lot of half-finished construction.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yeah, they all stopped like a few years ago.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Money just ran out.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Right. No, I don\\'t want to talk about the financial crisis. It\\'s bumming me out. It\\'s harsh in my total buzz. The pressures of the outside world, I don\\'t want to think about.\\n\\nI\\'m on a Greek island here. It\\'s a beautiful day. I\\'m planning on passing out on the beach shortly. You know, maybe some watercolors, do a little cooking, more napping, eating, napping. Contemplate mysteries of the universe or nap, either one.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Or nap, either...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Or eat cheese. All of those are honorable options. I mean, that\\'s a vacation to me, is staying put and doing nothing. I wanted to get away from it all. Coast gently, gently into another season of television. No sharp edges, easy.

Athens could just be roads away from finical disaster.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That Greece they say, is teetering on the edge of economic apocalypse, broke, in peril of being foreclosed on by the disdainful European powers. On top of that, there\\'s a refugee crisis.\\n\\nGreece, probably the least prepared, least equipped to take in thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, is being flooded with desperate women, children, men. They wash up on their shores alive and dead.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s not just a question of Greece now.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And yet here, on Naxos, one of thousands of Greek islands, you could for now if you chose to, remain blissfully ignorant of what\\'s happening elsewhere. Pretend that everywhere is just like here, beautiful, sleepy, delicious food, everything is just fine.\\n\\nJohn Steinbeck said any man who pits his intelligence against a fish and loses has it coming. But the Greek fishing trade didn\\'t stand a chance when hit with the one-two punch. First, of diminishing fish stocks, then the financial crisis and slacking demand.

This gentleman is a fisherman.\\n\\nLAMBROS: George is a fisherman. His name is fearless George.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Fearless George.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So, as I understand it, in many, if not all of the Greek Islands, the government or the E.U. is offering buyouts to fisherman? They\\'re basically saying, \"We\\'ll pay you to not fish.\"\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: They\\'re trying to get the older, domestic fishermen out of the way, basically in order to...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The little guys.\\n\\n[21:10:00] LAMBROS: Yes, the little guys in order to get more commercial fishing being imported into the land. Quite a few have sold out their businesses, their boats and moved in to like tourism.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Up here? I mean, as far as the -- the economic crisis, I mean, you\\'ve got the whole E.U. crunching down on poor Greece. Greeks are being depicted as basically lazy, addicted to social welfare. What happened?\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: I\\'m pretty sure he means the politicians.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: And the people -- and the people are paying for the complete wrongdoings of the politicians.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: So yes, it\\'s a shame really. Anyway, we had a good spell living on other people\\'s money for about 40 years was -- was good fun.\\n\\n[21:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nPANOS, DIVE MASTER AND GUIDE: The wreck was a cargo ship, and crashed on the reef in 1982, so it\\'s 34 years inside of the water.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Diving in the Cyclades is some of the best in the med and I was told this wreck was filled with stolen doubloons and Nazi morphine. Panos, my dive master, has certainly never heard these rumors. No treasure down there, nothing sinister or...\\n\\nPANOS: maybe there is inside, in the engine room. I never get there so I don\\'t know what is inside. The rumor is that they crashed it on purpose in order to take the insurance and so nobody was injured. Everybody was safely transferred to the Port of Ayama (ph). That\\'s a rumor, of course.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How many times have you been down to that wreck?\\n\\nPANOS: Hundreds of times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hundreds of times?\\n\\nPANOS: Hundreds of times.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And it never gets old? You still have fun?\\n\\nPANOS: Yes. Every time is special.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The Greek islands when compared to the rest of the country are doing pretty well. Tourism on Naxos, in fact, is on an uptick. I don\\'t know what your family told you when he said, \"You know, I\\'m going to go to Naxos and I\\'m going to run a dive center.\"\\n\\nI know my parents would\\'ve said, \"You should do something sensible with a future, like banking.\" As it turns out, this was a sensible career choice, I guess. So cheers to that.\\n\\nPANOS: Yes, yamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Around 25 percent of the nation is unemployed now. They say that about 40 percent are living close to the poverty line. That\\'s apparently the mainland? And yet tourism is stable and maybe even growing.\\n\\nPANOS: Well, it is, it is getting bigger even though it is completely opposite with a crisis.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So people are basically saying, \"Oh, financial crisis, beautiful islands, beautiful country.\"\\n\\nPANOS: Yes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: \"Now is the time to go because we can get it for cheap.\"\\n\\nPANOS: Tourism is the only thing I believe that saved Greece.

Yes, of course, I like very much the anarchy philosophy of course. It speaks about solidarity and the common good because all life in Greece now is very hard.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: During the \\'90s, it was all this wealth and prosperity and we were all okay with this. But now it\\'s time to talk about politics and make political statements.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A lot of the world, Greece is being depicted as Greeks got used to not having to pay taxes. The stereotype is...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a great - look...\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Is it true or not?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But that\\'s a very nice strategy to create a stereotype of the people you want to exploit. And say they are lazy, they\\'re terrible, AIDS propaganda, we can let them...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: From the moment we build our state, we build it on loans. The great powers, England, France, Russia, helped us to build our state so we owe from this moment. The truth is that never this nation took care of the citizens. They didn\\'t give back anything, nothing, to the people, so why to pay your taxes?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It\\'s distrust.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: A basic distrust is that people are going to spend the money well?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It\\'s not like -- it\\'s not like a mentality thing that comes from our genes, from our cells. We are not like the lazy people.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So what happens? Should Greece be in the E.U.?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here for the people in Greece, it is a feeling that \"Oh, if we go out of the European Union, we are lost.\" We are as people may be ready to risk to go in another direction because this direction doesn\\'t work for us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Nobody\\'s suggesting we return to an agrarian wonderland where we are all going to farm together and live in a commune, right?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why not?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: You like this idea?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, why not?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some of us will, some of us.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: If I put a yogurt in the refrigerator, and I put my name on it, \"Tony,\" and someone takes a bite out of it, I\\'ve got a problem.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Really?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes. This is why I don\\'t live in a commune.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because someone will be taking my yogurt?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, but if you didn\\'t have a yogurt, you would like to eat from someone else\\'s.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And I will.\\n\\n[21:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Hey, man, how are you doing?\\n\\nLABROS: Hi, tony, how are you?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Good now.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, an idyllic mountain village, Apiranthos.

Yes, it is.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: God of wine, women in song, basically.\\n\\nLAMBROS: And madness.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And madness? One of the things I like about Greek mythology is that the gods were all deeply flawed. I mean, they had some serious problems. They were always, you know, sleeping with humans. They were jealous. They get angry. They weren\\'t pure. They weren\\'t perfect. They weren\\'t divine. They were...\\n\\nSTEFANOS: They were humans.\\n\\nLAMBROS: Yes, but every now and then, Dionysus would appear and like everyone would say -- and then let\\'s all have a great time. Why not?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIEID MALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\n[21:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SINGING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I mean, you want this, right? Of course you do, but you can\\'t have it.\\n\\nYANNIS, FARM OWNER AND GUIDE: One pepper or two?\\n\\nBOURDAIN: No, one is good, one is good.\\n\\nYANNIS: And did you try a pepper? It\\'s different.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: All right. It\\'s beautiful, thank you.\\n\\nMARIA, FARM OWNER AND YANNIS\\' WIFE: Ok, here we eat a lot, OK? You can eat as much as you like.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Thank you. A family farm, this one dates back to the Venetians, mom, dad, daughter Maria, her husband Yannis, who happens to be the Aegean regional governor. Let the food begin -- stuffed pepper, the famous potatoes.\\n\\nYANNIS: Naxos potatoes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Coq au vin, a slow-cooked rooster?\\n\\nYANNIS: Rooster, rooster with red sauce.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And a...\\n\\nYANNIS: Rabbit.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Rabbit, oh yes.\\n\\nYANNIS: Yamas, welcome.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So how does that mean the rest of the country is not doing so well, but apparently here is pretty good?\\n\\nMARIA: Yes.\\n\\n[21:40:00] BOURDAIN: What\\'s different about Naxos?\\n\\nYANNIS: It\\'s...\\n\\nMARIA: Self-sustained.\\n\\nYANNIS: Self-sustained. For example, in Naxos, you can find 140,000 goats and lambs, and also, half of the population cultivating the land, so they are farmers.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: So it\\'s not just a tourist economy. You produce stuff here. You grow things.\\n\\nYANNIS: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Let me ask a difficult question. I\\'m not going to ask you this question because you have to be diplomatic about difficult questions like this. I\\'m going to guess your father doesn\\'t. So who caused the Greek financial crisis? What happened here?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nMARIA: He\\'s not optimistic. He says we have a -- (SPEAKING IN GREEK)...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nMARIA: We need years. (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What does it mean to be Greek? What are the characteristics that all Greeks either do or should aspire to?\\n\\nMARIA: She says, above all, the family. (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nYANNIS: This means Greek. Greek remains here.\\n\\nMARIA: We are bound to the land, the land of our ancestors.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: The farm itself, how long has it been in the family?\\n\\nMARIA: This was bought by other grandfather of my father in 1901.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nMARIA: For us in the family, it\\'s a very special place, and especially for me and I believe for my father. It has a special vibe. There\\'s a good energy, this land.\\n\\n[21:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Please translate -- so I went to the beach today. I\\'m lying there having a good time, suddenly like 200 nudists show up. Late afternoon, I find myself on a fishing boat ruminating on matters of great importance.\\n\\nSo here\\'s my question. It\\'s a philosophical question. Greece is the home of philosophy, as we know it. Why are the first people to take off their clothes the last people you want to see naked?\\n\\nGEORGE, FISHERMAN: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes, I totally agree with whatever he just said. Oh, yeah, here we go.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh yes, what do we got?\\n\\nGEORGE: Octopus salad.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Lambros is there, and George of course, and George\\'s son, Niko.\\n\\nLAMBROS: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\n[21:50:00] GEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah, mashed fava beans. It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nLAMBROS: This is like as traditional as you get. All these dishes are either uses an appetizer before the main dish which is the soup or as breakfast.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Breakfast?\\n\\nLAMBROS: They have this for breakfast, maybe a couple of beers, and then they go to sleep again for a few hours.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Now you\\'re talking my language.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Beautiful. All the fish he catches, it\\'s sold on the island, or sent to Athens?\\n\\nLAMBROS: Mostly to Athens.\\n\\nGEORGE: Niko.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: What kind of fish is this?\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: Olive oil and lemon.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Man, this is some professional-quality stuff.\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: You need to eat more.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ah, the broth is fantastic.\\n\\nGEORGE: Yamas.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yamas, thank you.\\n\\nLAMBROS: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nGEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nNIKO, GEORGE\\'S SON: (SPEAKING IN GREEK) LAMBROS: He liked his dad doing it and he likes doing it himself. (SPEAKING IN GREEK).\\n\\nBOURDAIN: I was going to ask.\\n\\nNIKO: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: Where there\\'s a will, there\\'s a way, he says. GEORGE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\nLAMBROS: This is going to be just a great pleasure to tell -- he said when they were at the right age, something like 14, he took him to the brothels and took him to the whores and told them to realize they are all out to get your money.\\n\\nGet them a few drinks, have a good time, go completely nuts while you\\'re young, and everything so you\\'re going to be a bit laid back on the whole woman issue when the time comes.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: When you\\'re 50?\\n\\nLAMBROS: Maybe, maybe.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Ok, OK, glad I asked. All right, not really.\\n\\nLAMBROS: So this is ouzo.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh, sweet. I\\'ll have some of that.\\n\\n[21:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBOURDAIN: My rented villa is pleasant enough, but to be perfectly honest, lonely. Is it worse to be someplace awful when you\\'re by yourself or someplace really nice that you can\\'t share with anyone?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: How are you doing?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yamas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And it is very typical Greek sunset, the famous Greek sunset.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED: The grasses, the boat, wow.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: That looks good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Looks very good.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh man, that is really good.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The good food makes you happy, very happy.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Yes.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Opens your heart.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: And there are a lot of countries where they\\'re really, really poor but they\\'re super serious about food.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like where?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like here? Don\\'t go, don\\'t go very far. BOURDAIN: People who are not Greek, come to the Greek islands for the first time, come to Naxos, what should you do here? You should drink Raki for sure.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For sure, to eat...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get drunk with Raki also.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Get drunk. It\\'s not enough to just drink it?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, get drunk and sing and dance.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don\\'t tell me what you ate. Tell me who you ate with.\\n\\nBOURDAIN: Oh.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN GREEK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n[22:00:00] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yamas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yamas.\\n\\n'}\n"
