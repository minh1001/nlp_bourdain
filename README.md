# Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown - Episode Recommender

### Presentation Time Limit: 4 minutes
The time constraints are purposefully kept short to force us to deliver our results in a clear and consise manner that can be digested by an audience of varying technical acumen.

The slide deck is not meant to by any means comprehnsively detail the substantial amount of analysis, coding, and modeling that went into the project.

### Objective: 
Based on the transcripts of 57 "Parts Unknown" episodes, build a model that will recommend episodes to watch based on user lifestyle and food preferences. The model will employ natural language processing techniques to construct a general "theme" of each episode and based on the user's preferences, recommend an episode that may be of interest.

### Data:
57 episode transcripts scraped from CNN - http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/abpu.html

### Code:
All coding was done in a Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab.
